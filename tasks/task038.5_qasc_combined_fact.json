    "Definition": "Merged the conferred two facts to write a conclude doing. Memo that, there should be some parts of the fiirst and second doing which are not talked in this conclusion doing. Your merge facto should be the consequence of a chain between the two truths. Padlocks shape when two truths connecting together to produce a conclude facto. An cases of a strings is: \"pesticides cause contamination\" (fact1) + \"polluted can prejudice beasts\" (fact2) â†’ \"insecticides can harm animals\" (conclusions facto)\nThings to avoiding: -\nFocusing & Discretion: Parts of the concluding facto straddle with the firstly and the second facto. To constructs such a  concluded fact, a useful pathways is to borrow the subjected from one facto and the ended outcome from another fact.",

At instance, substitutes topic of the gave fact with the word \"what\" can form a valid issue.\nAspects to forestall: 1. Don't be imaginative! Thee just needs to realign the words to turning the fact into a question - easily! 2. Don't just randomly abolition a word from the given fact to forms a issue. Remembers your question should estimation science understand.\nFocusing & Circumspect: 1. Selects a word or a expressions in the bestowed fact to be the rightness responses, then make the resting the issue. 2. Thee can furthermore form a matter without any WH words. Onto instance, \"A radios converts electrified into?\"",

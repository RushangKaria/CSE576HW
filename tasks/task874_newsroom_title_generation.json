   "input": "* Chinaoil, Unipec face off in Asia crude trade * Career oil traders rise to top of both companies * Push for more profits as firms become global traders * Beijing seen unlikely to intervene BEIJING SINGAPORE, Aug 21 (Reuters) - An intensifying rivalry between China's two top oil traders Chinaoil and Unipec is whipsawing Asia's oil market, pitting the state-owned firms against each other in a battle for control of the region's crude benchmark. Aggressive trading - with heavy buying by Chinaoil met by selling from Unipec - has pushed up Middle East crude prices for Asia, even as other grades are being pressed lower by a global glut. Asian buyers are being driven to seek cheaper oil elsewhere or cut refinery runs, but analysts say Beijing is unlikely to intervene in a process that reflects the growing clout of Chinese traders in global oil markets. The volumes exchanged by the two firms have been so high that pricing agency Platts is considering whether to allow more crude into a pool of supplies it uses to assess its daily Asian benchmark, the Dubai crude price. This was bound to happen - as Chinese traders become more familiar with global trading mechanisms , and their power within them increases, they are increasingly happy to work within them while also learning to use them to their advantage, said Michal Meidan of consultancy China Matters. Set up in 1993 to help manage China's oil imports , the state-owned firms have developed from simply procuring and marketing oil and refined products into sophisticated traders with global trading desks. The changes have been hastened by the ascendancy of career traders to the top of both companies in 2014, replacing corporate planners or refinery managers, while falling oil prices and slower demand growth have led to a push to boost trading profits. Chinaoil, which trades for Asia's largest oil producer PetroChina and has built itself into an integrated oil firm along the lines of BP, is now headed by former trader Zhao Yong. Unipec, which trades for Asia's largest refiner Sinopec Corp , is headed by Simon Chen, both 20-year veterans. With their rich trading experience , these new managers are more conscious of making a bigger impact than their predecessors, said a senior trading source with direct knowledge of the matter. In a series of buying sprees that began in October last year , Chinaoil has been snapping up record numbers of oil cargoes during a pricing mechanism that sets benchmark pricing for 12 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil sold in Asia, about 13 percent of the global consumption. The strong bidding has pushed up the benchmark price, fuelling speculation that Chinaoil was aiming to reap big profits on positions it had taken in the derivatives markets. On the other side of the market, Unipec's parent Sinopec imports nearly 80 percent of the 4.8 million bpd it processes - more than half of which is priced off Dubai - and its trading arm is preoccupied with keeping prices low. The rivalry has seen the pair duelling in the Singapore-based Platts Market on Close (MoC) assessment process, with Chinaoil bidding up Middle East cargoes and Unipec selling in an effort to restrain prices. Chinaoil has been breaking monthly trade volume records, buying 47 cargoes in October 2014, before taking a record 55 cargoes in April and 18 cargoes in June, with Unipec the seller for more than 60 percent in the April and June trade. Earlier this month, Chinaoil snapped up 10 cargoes from Unipec in a single day, the highest daily volume on record. The buying accorded with data from the Intercontinental Exchange showing a sharp build-up late last month in Dubai futures, that traders said suggested a likely bull play or move to push the physical price higher this month. The first day of trading this month exceeded the volume of crude Saudi sells in Asia in a day. That is astronomical , said a source with a Gulf oil producer. As trading intensifies , the Chinese pair have displaced global players like Royal Dutch Shell or top-league traders like Vitol who previously dominated the Dubai market. Chinaoil's oil trading volume more than quadrupled between 2003 and 2013, when a record 2.7 million barrels a day (bpd) was traded, while turnover grew nearly 18 fold to hit a record in 2013 at $102 billion, according to data on its website. In an internal shakeup last year, the firm set up a Beijing-based China Team that manages all of its China-related trading positions for crude oil, giving it more scope for trading, said senior traders with direct knowledge of the situations. Unipec too has shown signs of change in its trading strategy. The company bid in July and bought five cargoes, traders said. Unipec used to have many adversaries in the market due to its sheer size of crude purchasing. But now we face one powerful opponent , Chinaoil, said a senior source at Unipec who declined to be identified. The two have opposing trading interests. Chinaoil didn't respond to request for comment. Unipec declined comment. (Reporting by Chen Aizhu in BEIJING and Florence Tan in SINGAPORE; Editing by Henning Gloystein and Richard Pullin)  ",

   "input": "George Maciunas was the Lithuanian-born leader of Fluxus, an international avantgarde collective formed in 1960 that only really became respectable after its irascible founder died from cancer in 1978. Maciunas was a charming despot who herded a group of disparate artists into one of the most influential movements of the mid-20th century. His ambition was to create a world free of art, and replace it with Fluxus, a form of creativity so uncomplicated it could be realised anywhere and anyhow. Maciunas said the purpose of the movement was to promote a revolutionary flood and tide in art , promote living art, anti-art. When asked to define exactly what Fluxus was , Maciunas would often respond by playing samples of dogs barking or geese honking, rooting the movement firmly in the absurd tradition that had grown up out of dadaism and surrealism. Fluxus activities ranged from public performances and street theatre, to lo-fi sculptures. Maciunas was anti-ownership and refused to allow any of the Fluxus works to be signed, making it difficult for dealers to value their worth. He was also instrumental in transforming Soho from a run-down, unfashionable district of New York city into an artists colony; when a warehouse shut, Maciunas moved in, using it as an art space for his collegues and friends. Those enticed by the movement included Joseph Beuys, who was drawn to the group because of its inclusive philosophy - echoing as it did, Beuys's own beliefs that everyone was an artist. Yoko Ono was also a member and her bed-in with John Lennon is a classic example of Fluxus performance. Although Maciunas is possibly best known for a series of staged performances, one of which included systematically destroying a piano, he also made souvenir boxes. These were tailor made for individuals and contained artefacts and information relating to the year of their birth. Sometimes these boxes could be positively macabre. When he made one for fellow Fluxus member George Brecht (who claimed to be born in 1250), Macunias trawled the local hospitals for a human ear to be included as an homage to Genghis Khan, who notoriously counted the victims of his bloody battle in 1250 by cutting off their ears. Why we like him? Difficult, there are so many insane ideas to choose from. Probably the Flux-Olympiad, in which Maciunas proposed to stage a three-day sports event featuring soccer games on stilts, slow-speed bicycle races and balloon shot put. Although the artist died before the idea could be conceived, Tate Modern staged the event last year. Spared no expense: In 1964, Maciunas opened a shop on Canal street selling Fluxus multiples for $1, but made no sales in the first year. Ironically, a recent sketch by Beuys went for 00a320,000. Red October: His mother, a former Russian dancer, became the private secretary of Russian prime minister Aleksandr Kerenskyafter he emigrated to New York in 1940. Where can I see him?

   "input": "What a time to be alive! That was ESPN's Mark Jones hyperventilating after Georgia Tech reprised Auburn's 2013 Kick Six in Saturday's game against Florida State. The Seminoles were one of two undefeated teams to go down Saturday, reducing the ranks of unbeatens to 12, with just eight in the Power 5 conferences. But the game that had a bigger impact on the playoff race was USC's dismantling of Utah at the L.A. Coliseum, a game pegged by Vegas and the sharps -- who actually bet up the favored Trojans throughout the week -- but not the public at large. The final score of 42-24 actually flatters Utah as the game really wasn't even that close. As a result , the Pac-12 is the only Power 5 conference left without an unbeaten team and now on the outside of the playoff picture. The playoff committee will unveil its first rankings this season after next weekend's games. The actual playoff games won't be played until New Year's Eve. But the entire season is really a series of playoff games and beginning next week we'll be entering the de facto quarterfinal phase of it. You've probably read a few pieces that claim this season's playoff picture remains very much muddled. Don't believe it. The races are becoming crystal clear and they boil down to these games: * LSU at Alabama (Nov. 7): The winner of this game will win the SEC West, which isn't as competitive as ESPN or SEC apologists would like you to believe. The SEC East winner will be determined at the World's Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party (Florida-Georgia in Jacksonville) on Saturday, but expect the SEC title game to be a mere coronation for LSU or 'Bama. * Michigan State at Ohio State (Nov. 21): Thanks to their miraculous escape against Michigan a week ago, the Spartans will keep their date with the Buckeyes for the Big Ten East title. While Iowa is unbeaten, too, and probably will roll through the rest of the West, it's not in the same class as these two heavyweights. * Baylor at TCU (Nov. 27): While Oklahoma State is also unbeaten and will host both of these teams, it does not have the cache of weapons to keep up. A bit worrisome for Baylor is that quarterback Seth Russell might be out awhile with a fracture in his neck, and without him the Bears will have trouble keeping up with Trevone Boykin and TCU, out to avenge last year's 61-58 collapse that kept them out of the inaugural playoff. * Notre Dame at Stanford (Nov. 28): This is a bit like a wild-card game, depending on what happens with unbeaten Clemson. The Tigers handed Notre Dame its only loss and the playoff spot is theirs to lose. But if they somehow stumble down the stretch and fail to win the ACC title, that last playoff spot will go to the winner of this game -- and if it's Stanford, it must also win the Pac-12 title game the following week. Group of Five a Four-Way Race It looks like the American Athletic champion will have a lock on the Group of Five New Year's Six Bowl bid, with only MAC's Toledo with a shot to play spoiler. Three AAC teams are still undefeated, though only one among Memphis, Houston and Temple will finish the year that way, of course. Memphis has the best resume so far -- and its coach Justin Fuente will be one of the hottest candidates on the job market, especially the one that just opened in Miami. But Temple has a chance to become the frontrunner this weekend with a huge showdown against visiting Notre Dame. A victory over the top 10-ranked Irish will propel the Owls, as well as their own coach Matt Rhule, another hot coaching candidate who might soon be headed to the Big Ten. Saturday provided us not one, but two, four-OT extravaganzas that were short on aesthetics and long on the amount of time it took. Duke outlasted host Virginia Tech while Arkansas survived at home against Auburn. While neither game had any playoff or even conference-race implications, they made two otherwise pedestrian games infinitely more interesting. But that's the problem with college football's overtime rules. It's more of a skills competition than a serious tiebreaker. I happened to cover the original 4-OT thriller in 1996 when the OT rules was first installed, and even back then it was obvious they were too offensive in nature. One quick fix can make college's overtime a lot better and still superior to the NFL's version: Make teams start on the 40-yard line instead of 25. This way, an offensive team is not automatically in field goal range and the defense can have a much better chance at ending the game on a turnover or on downs. Georgia Tech 22, Florida State 16: A week after Michigan State's improbable victory over Michigan on a botched punt snap, the Yellow Jackets reprised their own Kick Six by returning a blocked field-goal attempt into a game-winning touchdown. The loss not only ended the Seminoles' 28-game ACC winning streak , but in all likelihood eliminated them from playoff consideration. Connor Cook, Michigan State: The senior quarterback completed 30 of 52 passes for 398 yards and four touchdowns to rescue the Spartans from Indiana's upset bid. The Hoosiers trailed only 28-26 entering the fourth quarter before Cook engineered two long scoring drives as Michigan State scored the game's final 24 points in a 52-26 victory. Top 4: Clemson, LSU, TCU, Ohio State. Next 4: Michigan State, Baylor, Notre Dame, Stanford. Other contenders: Florida, Alabama, Oklahoma State, Iowa, Utah. -- Samuel Chi is the managing editor of RealClearSports.com and proprietor of College Football Exchange.

   "input": "Last November, the phone rang. It was The Observer's celebrated Jane Bown asking if I had heard of Jarvis Cocker because the picture editor had asked her to photograph him. One of the best parts of my job over the past few years has been getting to know Jane - I run the Newsroom, The Observer and Guardian archive and exhibition space to which Jane has donated her entire collection. I encouraged her to do Jarvis Cocker and asked if she had photographed many pop stars. Her reply was delivered with typical matter-of-factness - the Beatles (twice), Cher and Greg Allman, Joan Baez, Keith Richards, Mick Jagger, Eartha Kitt, Pete Townsend, Bono, Morrissey, Sinead O'Connor, Boy George, P.J. Harvey, Bj 00f6rk. For starters. For months, we'd been talking about an exhibition at the Newsroom but the only thing we'd decided was that it would be best to steer clear of her more well-known pictures. The problem is that the collection is vast - more than 50 years of work - and choosing any single subject is nearly impossible. But, suddenly, we seemed to have our exhibition - rock-star portraits. We agreed that we needed some new pictures to supplement the older ones. How about going to Glastonbury? I suggested. Jane jumped at the idea. Three cameras were dispatched for servicing, press passes were obtained and contact was made with various bands and managers, most of whom knew of Jane and her work and were more than willing to help. As soon as we arrived on site early on Friday morning, Jane was off. In the first hour, she had taken photos of a man with a child in a wheelbarrow, a 'fairy' leaving the portaloo, a man asleep outside his tent and legions of campers brushing their teeth at the outdoor taps. When it started to rain, Jane positioned herself just inside the awning of the catering tent and, in the next hour or so, her cameras were rarely idle. From here, she got a picture of John Peel as he headed for cover. We went backstage for her first appointment - David Gray. Backstage turned out to be the corner of a field lined with Portakabins - decidedly unglamorous and offering limited possibilities for photographs. Having surveyed the surroundings, Jane was introduced to Gray. They headed off to a remote corner of the enclosure. Ten minutes later, Jane had her picture. They shook hands and he headed off to get ready for his performance. Word came through that Jane's next appointment - Michael Stipe - was running late and would not get to site until after dark and that there would be no time for pictures. Undaunted, she thought it might be good to take some shots of the crowd in front of the main stage. We were escorted to that deafening no-man's-land between the stage and the audience peopled by security, the placed where body-surfers come ashore. Jane went into professional mode and remained oblivious to the incongruity of the situation. There is an extraordinary economy in the way she takes photographs. She works in black and white, without lights or props, and never uses a tripod or light meter (she gauges the settings by looking at how the light falls on the back of her hand). She works quickly and rarely takes more than one or two rolls of film per shoot. She is happiest when she has her subject to herself or when she is allowed to roam freely and unobtrusively. She can take a photograph, change a lens or reload a camera with the dexterity of a card sharp. Her most famous portrait - Samuel Beckett - was taken in less than a minute in an alleyway at the side of London's Royal Court. The following day, appointments had been organised with The Polyphonic Spree and Radiohead. Waiting for The Polyphonic Spree to don their robes - all 23 of them perform in ankle-length white tunics - was a frustrating business, a bit like trying to get sheep through a gate. While we waited, Jools Holland came backstage after his set. I asked him if Jane could take his picture. He beamed with the enthusiasm of a child and replied that it would be his 'very great pleasure'. Then The Polyphonic Spree were ready and in about 15 minutes Jane took group shots as well as a portrait of the leader, Tim DeLaughter. Just before we left, Radiohead's PR called. They were behind schedule but the band were sorry to miss the opportunity for a Jane Bown portrait. Would it be at all possible for her to take one in London later in the month? 00b7 Jane Bown's exhibition will take place at the Newsroom, 60 Farringdon Road, EC1 from 10 September to 24 October, 2003.

I imagine one reason the buyers jumped in was they were adhering to the Warren Buffett adage, buy when others are fearful.

   "input": "A fake filing related to a takeover of Avon has highlighted several issues for regulators. Avon was having a perfectly normal day, trading around $6.60 at 11:35 a.m., ET, when the stock shot up to almost $6.97, triggering a volatility trading halt. These volatility trading halts are single-stock circuit breakers that were created after the 2010 flash crash to control volatile trading in stocks. Simply put , it stops trading in a stock if it moves more than 5 percent in a five- minute period. The stock halts for five minutes everywhere (not just on the NYSE), then reopens, but if there are still huge imbalances, it can be halted for up to another five minutes. Some firm calling itself PTG Capital had filed an offer to buy Avon for an exorbitant price. Given that it was at a 20-year low, the move immediately attracted attention. The stock reopened, and immediately shot up to almost $8, triggering another trading halt. By then, traders on the floor were noticing that the filing contained numerous typos, and no one had ever heard of them. There were rumors floating around that they didn't even exist. My colleague Brian Sullivan called both the attorney's listed for the firm and the company; both went into very odd sounding voice mail. When it reopened, the stock went in the other direction, from roughly $7.98 to $7.60, triggering a third and final trading halt. CNBC reached out to Avon and they told us it has not received any offer or other communication from such an entity ... and has not been able to confirm that such an entity exists. In other words , it was a hoax. There are two problems here: 1) how on earth did a phony filing get into the SEC's Edgar database? The trading community assumes filings made there are accurate and reliable, because 2014everyone assumes 2014they are supposed to be vetted by the SEC. 2) the NYSE (and other exchanges) should have the power to halt a stock when there is unusual and unexplainable trading activity, but it does not. A company has the power to halt trading in its stock if it has news pending , but that did not happen. In fact , the NYSE was unable to get in touch with the company during the halts, despite many attempts. In the past, NYSE floor officials were able to halt stocks for an order imbalance , that is , a huge order of buy stocks with no sell orders, or vice-versa. That went away several years ago. Instead, the volatility trading halts were what stopped the trading. That's what happened 2014three times. It might be easier and more logical if exchange officials merely had the power to halt stocks that are trading strangely for inexplicable reasons. This is an issue for the regulators. At 2 p.m. , ET, the stock was still trading up roughly 6 percent. Why? Because the big price moves and huge volume (more than five times normal) generated heavier than usual volume and volatility, even after everyone realized the story was a hoax. How is that possible? Because heavy trading begets more trading. The heavy volume and higher volatility allowed traders to step in and make small amounts of money trading the stock, which corresponds to that cynical old trader saw, it doesn't matter if the story is right or wrong, as long as you're on the right side of the trade.

MIT 2019s proposed redevelopment promises to transform stale parking lots along Main Street into six buildings full of office, retail, research, and living space, with a lively streetscape below. But the project would also generate more than 5,800 vehicle trips and 7,500 transit trips each day, according to a 200-plus-page transportation study commissioned by MIT. That could put more pressure on roadways, trains, and buses. The university has made 201cno substantial commitments 201d to ease the burden of that growth, even though the project 201cwill create significant new demands on the local and regional transportation networks, 201d Cambridge Traffic, Parking, and Transportation Department staff wrote in a memo to the Planning Board this month. The memo raised specific concerns about the project 2019s effect on the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority 2019s Red Line and the 85 and CT2 bus lines. It also questioned MIT 2019s net creation of more than 1,000 parking spaces at a time when the city is trying to discourage driving. (The project includes spots for more than 1,000 bicycles, as well.) Michael Owu, chairman of MIT 2019s transportation and parking committee, said the university will work closely with the city to mitigate traffic problems. He said the redevelopment wouldn 2019t be an overall burden on transit. The broad challenges of getting in, around, and out of the area led to the creation in the past year of the Kendall Square Mobility Task Force, consisting of state and city officials and business and civic leaders. The group will hold a public meeting Oct. 15 at 5:30 p.m. at the Kennedy-Longfellow School on Spring Street. Despite their concerns about traffic, city officials generally support MIT 2019s expansion, its support for more housing in the area, and its goal of injecting more vibrant street life into Kendall Square. 201cWith the right set of incentives, and right set of facilities, we can keep up that growth without it becoming unmanageable, 201d said Joseph Barr, director of Cambridge 2019s traffic department. But other major projects, including the redevelopment of the Volpe center, are coming 2014 and could bring their own sets of transit and traffic challenges. Cambridge is home to a plethora of companies and research institutions that push the boundaries of science and technology. Yet drivers in the city can 2019t use a smartphone app to pay for street parking 2014 a tool rolled out in both Boston and Somerville months ago. Barr, the Cambridge traffic guru, said city officials are working on an app-based payment system, but don 2019t have an expected date of arrival. So keep scrounging for those quarters.

But those who skate through disasters with no personal impact? 201cThey behave a lot more aggressively when they become CEOs, 201d Gennaro Bernile, an assistant professor of finance at Singapore Management University, told a packed lecture hall at MIT last weekend. Those traits can matter to a company 2019s financial direction, Bernile argued. After all, a chief executive 2019s assertiveness will shape how much cash his company keeps on hand and its acquisition strategy.

   "input": "(James Saft is a Reuters columnist. The opinions expressed are his own) July 31 (Reuters) - State public pension funds love buying shares in local companies, but it is not so much a matter of buying what you know as buying shares of companies with political clout. A new study of equity holdings of self-managed state public pension funds finds that they have not only a bias towards in-state companies , but in particular towards those with political connections and influence. What's more, these investments aren't winners; this bias towards in-state politically connected firms costs the typical state pension fund about $225 million in annual decline in fund performance, according to estimates in the study, which is slated to be published in an upcoming Journal of Financial Economics. We find that state pension funds overweight these politically active firms and doing so is detrimental to fund equity performance , write authors Daniel Bradley and Xiaojing Yuan of the University of South Florida and Christos Pantzalis of the University of Massachusetts at Lowell. (http: papers.ssrn.com sol3 papers.cfm?abstracttid=2636996) Our evidence is most consistent with the political bias hypothesis. Remember too , state pension funds are hardly in good shape and cannot afford to make poor and politically motivated investments. The aggregate funding ratio of U.S. public pension funds was only 72 percent of liabilities in 2013, according to a survey by the National Association of State Retirement Administrators. That leaves more than $1 trillion of future liabilities unfunded nationwide. It has long been known that state pension funds have a tendency to invest in firms within their state. Some argue that this is due to mere familiarity, though were this true it would not affect performance. Others assert that pension funds invest at home because they enjoy some information advantage which they seek to exploit. If this information advantage were due to political connections, then holdings of firms in this group would outperform. What the study seems to have found, though, is that the allocations are going to local firms for political reasons and that this, because it comes from conflicted political motivations, leads in turn to underperformance. It should be noted that the study used a relatively small sample size: 16 pension funds which manage their own money and made Securities and Exchange Commission disclosures for at least 20 consecutive quarters between 1999 and 2009. That said, the sample included large and well-known pension funds including the Virginia Retirement System, the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) and the New York State Common Retirement Fund. To determine which companies qualify as politically connected or active, the study constructed measures to weigh the extent that a given fund invests more with firms making political action committee (PAC) contributions to home state politicians or engaging in lobbying. The finding was that state pension funds will tend to overweight their holdings of local firms that make PAC contributions by 23 percent and those that lobby by 17 percent relative to their neutral weight in a market portfolio. Interestingly, the only local companies that displayed significant positive outperformance were non-politically connected local firms. Perhaps if you are good enough to overcome a biased, politically influenced system your company might actually be a winning investment. As well, state pension funds tend to hold on to the stocks of politically connected companies longer. They are also poor at making decisions about when to buy and sell these politically connected stocks: selling winners too soon and riding losses too long. This phenomenon is not present for non-politically active stocks, according to the study. Unsurprisingly, the degree of political bias in state pension funds is linked to how they are governed. Local political connection bias - the tendency to own the shares of politically connected local firms - is stronger in state pension funds with a higher percentage of politically affiliated trustees. And while having an influential member of Congress in your home state might help bring home some political bacon in government spending, it is a drawback for pension governance. States with more influential politicians in Congress tend to invest more in politically connected local firms, suffering the underperformance that that implies. Pension fund managers and trustees have an obligation to the members of their funds as well as taxpayers who ultimately might be called on to make good any shortfall. This trumps any wooly local economic development that might come from providing capital locally. While it would be good to see a larger sample, a responsible state pension fund ought to be doing this analysis for itself and making changes in the holdings based on what they find.

   "input": "Those suffering from vertigo should look away now. The shortlist for the prize honouring the best new private home in the UK has revealed an increasingly common quirk among cutting-edge architects to go alongside the perennial fondness for floor-to-ceiling glass: rooms suspended in mid-air. Two of the six contenders for the 2011 Manser Medal, organised annually by the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), display this trick, known in the trade as cantilevering. One, Ty Hedfan in Brecon 2013 the name means hovering house in Welsh 2013 cunningly circumvents planning restrictions against building along the river bank which adjoins the plot by sending out a glass-walled spur to hang above the water's edge. More dramatic still is the self-explanatory Balancing Barn in Suffolk , pictures of which resemble on first glance an optical illusion. At least half of the long, slim structure hangs precipitously over the edge of a steep, grass incline. It looks as if an escaped railway carriage has run out of track or, thanks to the shiny silver cladding, like a floating barrage balloon. The barn, which is available for public rent, is completely bonkers and very playful , said Tony Chapman, head of awards at RIBA and one of the five-strong judging panel. Most alarming, he said, is the glass floor inside the far-hanging edge: It's so potentially unnerving for some people that they provide bits of carpet you can put over it , if you want. The appeal for the judges of Ty Hedfan's cantilever was as much practical as aesthetic , Chapman said: They weren't allowed to build on the river bank but there's nothing in the small print which says you can't build over the river bank. We like things like that , which get one over slightly on the planners. The other four contenders are a varied bunch , albeit within a prevailing taste for generous glazing which blurs the boundaries between home and garden, and materials which seek to blend the building with the wider landscape. There is one urban dwelling, not strictly speaking a new residence: a mid-century, brutalist home in Highgate, north London, remodelled to open the rooms out onto a secluded garden. Another triumph against the planners is Watson House, an elegant glass-and-timber structure in the heart of the New Forest, which was only permitted on condition it was invisible from public sections of the woodland. The most modest home 2013 a relative term within a selection with budgets starting at 00a3500,000 2013 is New Mission Hall in Sussex, a pair of conjoined structures on the site of a Baptist chapel which offers a blank, brick facade from the road before opening out into a glassed rectangle at the rear. The final contender, in the Surrey stockbroker belt of Epsom, most closely resembles the stereotypical notion of a modernist house, from its over 700 sq metres of living space and curtains of walled glass grand enough to satisfy the most demanding exhibitionist to its occupants who seemingly own little more than a few discreetly tasteful items of furniture and art, their toothbrushes presumably locked well out of view. Inside, however, the design was clever enough to avoid severity, Chapman said, featuring touches like a cosy family TV room deep inside the interior. You go in there and your first thought is , 'yes, this is an expensive, grand house'. But as you go round it you find lots of lovely little things that make it very intimate. Overall , he said, the shortlist was perhaps the most diverse in the prize's 10-year history. The inclusion of the pair of cantilevered structures had not been planned. Maybe subliminally we paired them off , he said. But I don't think we did it deliberately. While it would be slightly arrogant for RIBA to assume the prize had a direct influence on the wider design of housing , Chapman said, the hope was it might provide food for thought. The whole point of the medal , I think, is to try and improve the standard of all housing. We would like to think that there were things that fed into social housing in Hackney as well as the next rich person's house in Surrey. The standard of housebuilding in this country is not great. In fact it's pretty poor. It would be good if we could even just inspire clients to ask for things they might not have otherwise considered. The winner will be announced at a ceremony on 10 November.  ",

Read MoreEarnings top list of what could rock markets The Goldman analysts said earnings reporting months have seen 1.2 percent higher realized volatility than other months, while corporations are sidelined. The analysts said an S&P pullback to 1,870 would be similar to 13 pullbacks since 2009, in terms of size and duration, with the S&P 500 losing 5 percent plus. We continue to forecast S&P 500 EPS will grow by 8 percent in 2015 as U.S. real GDP expands above 3 percent. Two-thirds of S&P 500 sales are derived domestically , and we estimate only a modest earnings impact from slower foreign growth, a strengthening USD (dollar), and lower oil. We expect steady U.S. growth and low interest rates will keep valuations stable, meaning the market level should rise in line with earnings, the analysts wrote. Buybacks have been aiding this earnings growth. Twenty-five percent of the (S&P 500) companies are going to have at least a 4 percent year-over-year impact on their EPS , aided by share count reduction, said Howard Silverblatt , S&P indices analyst. He said that third-quarter forecast compares with 23 percent of companies in the second quarter. For the 12 months ending June 30, buybacks totaled $533 billion, up from $421 billion a year earlier. The record quarter for buybacks was $172 billion in Q3, 2007. The 12-month total shareholder return , which is buyback and dividends, was $866 billion for the 12 months ending in June.

Asked if love was different for her as a beautiful woman than it might be for average folks , Webb told The News' Michael O. Allen, I go through the same thing everybody else does. I have a normal heart. You are talking about the wrapping , not what is in the package.

   "input": "The skies of Boston may be raining broadband in another year or two. We 2019re in line to host two startups that might free us from today 2019s Internet monopolies, offering multiple options for getting online. Starry Inc., a company based in Boston and New York, got a lot of ink last week when it announced it will sell a wireless Internet service capable of cable-like performance. Just attach a Starry antenna to the outside of your home, the company claims, and you 2019ll get download speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second. Starry said it is carrying out technical trials and expects to plug in customers in the Boston area by summer. Artemis Networks LLC is a San Francisco outfit that also wants to transmit data sometime this year. It has joined with Webpass Inc., another San Francisco company that has installed a wireless Internet system in 10 Boston apartment buildings, including the luxury high-rise going up at Downtown Crossing where Filene 2019s used to be. Webpass founder Charles Barr told me he 2019d love to serve the entire city, but its wireless technology is too costly for single-family homes. Enter Artemis, which plans to set up hundreds of 201cpWave 201d radios, each of them a miniature 4G LTE transmitter that will connect to the Internet through the Webpass fiber network. The companies expect to provide connections of around 12 megabits per second for mobile devices and as much as 100 megabits for users in fixed locations, such as houses. All these little radios will interfere with each other, and that 2019s usually a recipe for disaster. But Artemis claims it has invented a way to use the interference itself as a channel for transmitting and receiving data. The more interference, the better pWave is supposed to work. Artemis founder Steve Perlman told me that if the Federal Communications Commission gives the nod, service in Boston could begin this year. The founder of Aereo, a TV streaming service that collapsed after losing a copyright case in the U.S. Supreme Court, is unveiling more details about his new startup. Both Starry and Artemis rely on radical new technologies that may prove less impressive in the real world than in a lab. So skepticism is justified. But I 2019m hopeful about these two, because the people behind them are unusually good at failure. Consider Starry 2019s founder, Chaitanya 201cChet 201d Kanojia. His last brainstorm was Aereo, an alternative TV system that transmitted broadcast television shows over the Internet. Kanojia said he didn 2019t have to pay the TV networks for the privilege; the US Supreme Court disagreed. Goodbye Aereo. But I tried Aereo, and it worked exactly as advertised. Kanojia may not have a good handle on intellectual property law, but the man knows how to build a network. Meanwhile Artemis 2019s Steve Perlman fathered two of the tech industry 2019s most interesting failures. In the mid-1990s, he developed WebTV, a now-forgotten attempt to turn living room sets into Web browsers. It worked so well that Microsoft Corp. bought the company for half a billion dollars, only to learn the hard way that consumers weren 2019t interested. Then in 2009, Perlman launched OnLive, an ahead-of-its-time service that ran best-selling video games at a remote data center. For a monthly fee, OnLive subscribers could simply log on to play dozens of games. Again, the technology worked; again, the company flopped. Still, Sony Corp. bought the OnLive technology and now runs a similar game-subscription service through its PlayStation video-game console. Perlman doesn 2019t always lose. His Mova motion-capture video technology premiered at the Boston Convention & Exhibition Center 10 years ago. Since then, it 2019s won an Oscar, and been used in countless videogames, commercials, and Hollywood films. With track records like these, Perlman and Kanojia are probably onto something. I desperately hope so. Today, Boston is a broadband wasteland because of the near-monopoly held by Comcast Corp. I get excellent service from Comcast in my Dorchester home. But when my South End church asked Comcast about broadband service a few years back, the company demanded $20,000 to plug us in. Why? Because they could. Rival carrier RCN Telecom Services LLC covers only a few parts of the city. Google Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. have both refused to spend millions to plant fresh fiber in Boston, and Verizon 2019s slow DSL service is a pitiful substitute for true broadband. Our digital salvation must come from above. Boston already has NetBlazr Inc. of Allston, a wireless Internet carrier with a few hundred clients scattered around town. If Starry and Artemis each work as advertised, we 2019ll have a truly competitive broadband market for the first time. That 2019s an idea that 2019s too good to fail.  ",

They're mulling over whether to give Bethany a lump-sum payment to fix the imbalance. It sounds mercenary, even cruel. But there are ways within the system to show affection. Recently Danny and Bethany haggled to see if he would drive her home after a long day of work or if she would have to ride her bike.

   "input": "After 170-plus nations signed the Paris climate agreement last week and now with trans-Atlantic trade talks back on President Obama 2019s agenda, it 2019s clear that the international community 2019s trade rules will need to be rethought, revamped, and rewritten if we 2019re going to be successful in curbing climate change. When the top emitting countries 2013 United States, China and India, for example 2013 are busying taking each other to court for supporting renewable energy investments, and effectively preventing them from going forward, this significantly hampers our ability to tackle global warming and ramp up the necessary renewable energy to transition the grid. While India appeals to the World Trade Organization 2013 which ruled in the U.S. government 2019s favor and demanded a level playing field for foreign solar companies 2013 dangerous precedents are being set, post-Paris climate agreement, that bode ill for countries keen to curb their emissions. The idea that the U.S. 2013 or any of these big three emitters 2013 is serious about a level playing field when it comes to their energy industries holds little merit. Worldwide, based on the latest figures from the International Energy Agency, the fossil fuel industry 2013 specifically coal, oil, and gas industries 2013 were subsidized to the tune of $550 billion annually. This is four times what the renewable energy industry received. In the United States, the government is subsidizing coal, oil and gas industries at $20 billion a year. And it 2019s worth noting that President Obama increased these subsidies by 35% since taking office in 2009. If the United States 2013 or any other country 2013 genuinely wants a WTO-brokered level playing field then it must stop subsidizing the energy industry and that includes oil, coal, and gas. It 2019s likely Washington D.C. legislators are keeping quiet because oil and gas firms are among the top three biggest lobbying industries contributing to Congress, ranked beside the pharmaceutical and insurance industries, paying hundreds of millions of dollars annually to ensure taxpayer subsidies continue. See also: How Corporate America Can Support the Paris Climate Deal This has got to stop if we care at all about our national carbon footprint. There is nothing sustainable about this agenda, especially if you consider all the costs countries have to cover when considering fossil fuel 2019s negative externalities. According to the International Monetary Fund, $5.5 trillion is being paid by governments globally in order to 201cfully reflect the environmental damage associated with energy consumption 201d. What a devastating sum that could be spent in substantially more constructive ways. For Washington and Beijing and Delhi to show serious commitment to their climate targets, a new agenda is necessary. First, stop the finger pointing. It 2019s unhelpful and disingenuous of the United States government 2013 and, frankly, the myriad environmental nongovernmental organizations that backup the administration 2013 to use any kind of stick when instigating a conversation about China 2019s and India 2019s climate commitment when the U.S. is equally guilty of undermining an energy transition. Second, stop fortifying fossil fuels. Mindful of the White House 2019s own report this month connecting health impacts to climate change, something similarly identified in a Lancet report last year, any subsidies to oil, coal, and gas are a direct hit to public health, a bill which taxpayers should refuse to support. It 2019s illogical, bordering on the absurd, to financially support a practice that simultaneously undermines one 2019s health. And as long as we continue to prop up methane-heavy natural gas, carbon dioxide-heavy oil, and toxic-laden coal, that is exactly what we 2019re doing. Third, start enforcing change. Big promises came out of Paris on the climate front. Big pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Big targets to tackle. And just in time. This month 2019s study that sea levels are rising much faster than previously thought, and will hit six feet by the end of this century if we don 2019t act fast, shows that we don 2019t have much time. We need to move now. Not in 2050. Fourth, start rapidly ramping up investments in the energy infrastructure of the future. It 2019s poor planning to build more oil and gas pipelines when we clearly can 2019t be relying on them in 10,20, or 30 years. Renewable energy infrastructure should be the sole focus for U.S., China, and India going forward and nations should support each other 2019s efforts, rather than undermining them within the WTO. The price point is behind us on this. There 2019s no good argument anymore for weak investments or laissez-faire strategies. This is where the economic growth opportunity is and it comes with an immediate health and climate co-benefit. The planet does not have time to witness more stalled sustainability measures, scuttled by trade texts and WTO tribunals. Revise the trade language now to be more climate-friendly 2013 including investor-state dispute settlement mechanisms which rarely come down on the side of the environment 2013 before more hottest year and highest carbon records are broken. Globalization at the price of global warming and its increasingly raucous extreme weather helps no one. The time to tweak our trade texts, so they 2019re 100% more climate-friendly, is now.

   "input": "US Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has defeated Hillary Clinton in West Virginia's primary, winning over voters deeply sceptical about the economy and keeping his candidacy alive against the frontrunner. Tonight it appears that we won a big victory in West Virginia , Sanders said after the results for Tuesday's primary came in , and this is a state where Hillary Clinton won with 40 points against Barack Obama in 2008. The loss slows Clinton's march to the nomination , but she is still heavily favoured to become the Democratic candidate in the November 8 election. Deep concerns about the economy were key in West Virginia's Democratic primary. About six in 10 voters said they were very worried about the direction of the US economy in the next few years. The same proportion cited the economy and jobs as their most important voting issues, according to a preliminary ABC News exit poll. OPINION: Muslims for Bernie Sanders A remark Clinton made at an Ohio town hall in March that the country would put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business may have hurt her chances with voters in coal-mining states such as West Virginia. West Virginia miners switch loyalties During Clinton's visit to West Virginia and Ohio last week she repeatedly apologised to displaced coal and steel workers for her comment , which she said had been taken out of context, and discussed her plan to help retrain coal workers for clean energy jobs. But, Al Jazeera's Kimberly Halkett, reporting from Charleston, said the damage was already done. Coal mining is the lifeblood of West Virginia , she said. Voters I talked to said they are throwing support behind Sanders , or switching parties altogether, and voting in the primary for Donald Trump. West Virginia was once solid Democratic party territory. But , that's no longer the case. The Republicans are gaining support here due to Barack Obama's clean energy policies decimating jobs in the state in the last four years, by the thousands. 00c2 To secure the Democratic nomination , a candidate needs 2,383 delegates. Going into West Virginia, Clinton, a former US secretary of state, had 2,228 delegates, including 523 so-called superdelegates, elite party members who are free to support any candidate. Sanders had 1,454 delegates, including 39 superdelegates. Another 29 delegates will be apportioned based on West Virginia's results. Clinton and Sanders will compete in another primary contest on May 17. Both candidates are also looking ahead to the June 7 contests, the last in the long nominating season, in which nearly 700 delegates are at stake, including 475 in California, where Sanders is now focusing his efforts. Sanders has vowed to take his campaign all the way to the Democrats' July 25-28 convention in Philadelphia, and wants a say in shaping the party's platform. Sanders has repeatedly told supporters at packed rallies that most opinion polls indicate he would beat Trump in a general election match-up by a larger margin than polls show Clinton defeating Trump. When you look at a Donald Trump-Hillary Clinton match-up , Donald Trump comes ahead, but when you pair Donald Trump to Bernie Sanders in a general election, it is Sanders who comes out on top, Al Jazeera's Halkett said. This is the challenge that Hillary Clinton faces. She does have the lead in terms of the pledged delegates , the establishment if you will, but what she doesn't have is a strong support from those who are working-class. READ MORE: Trump's the choice Trump 00c2 won contests in West Virginia and Nebraska handily on Tuesday. Recently , Trump has zeroed in on Clinton's protracted battle with Sanders. He has taunted Clinton by saying she can't close the deal by beating Sanders. Clinton has said she will ignore Trump's personal insults , including his repeated use of his new nickname for her, Crooked Hillary , and instead will criticise his policy pronouncements. Trump, shifting into general election mode, has already begun to consider running mates. He told Fox on Tuesday night that he has narrowed down his list to five people. He did not rule out picking New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a former rival who ended his presidential bid in February. Christie, who endorsed Trump and then campaigned for him, was named on Monday 00c2 to head Trump's White House transition team. Source: 00c2 Al Jazeera and agencies  ",

   "input": "Aaron Copland, America's best-known composer of classical music and a gentle yet impassioned champion of American music in every style, died yesterday evening at Phelps Memorial Hospital in North Tarrytown, N.Y. He was 90 years old. His physician, Charles L. Starke, said the cause of death was respiratory failure brought on by pneumonia. Mr. Copland, who was suffering from diabetes, had two strokes within the last three weeks, Dr. Starke said. Integrating Opposites Of many notable achievements, Mr. Copland's greatest gift was his ability to be both serious and popular, to adhere to the formal integrity and moral earnestness of modernism and also to espouse the generous accessibility of the dominant political mores of the 1930's and 40's. In ballet scores like Billy the Kid (1938) , Rodeo (1942) and above all Appalachian Spring (1944) , and in concert pieces like El Salon Mexico (1937) , Fanfare for the Common Man (1942) and Lincoln Portrait (1942) , Mr. Copland touched a chord in the American psyche reached by no other classical musician this country has produced. Yet in less programmatic works, some of them even embracing the supposedly elitist 12-tone system of Arnold Schoenberg, like the Piano Variations (1930), the Short Symphony (1934) , the Third Symphony (1946) and Connotations (1962) , Mr. Copland managed to speak with an uncompromisingly rigorous voice. That musical integrity underlay his more popular pieces and lent gravity to their charms. A New Appreciation Attacked by admirers of his more popular style, the later works now increasingly seem the work of the same man, whose breadth of vision and warmth of spirit could unite Teutonic Serialism and all-American hoedowns. Mr. Copland's tireless industry as a concert organizer and promoter of new music was nearly as important a part of his legacy to American music as the paramount importance of his compositions. Blessed with what the composer David Diamond once called an innate , natural sense of diplomacy, Mr. Copland worked throughout the 1920's and 30's to organize concert series of new music , to publish American scores and to further the cause of the American composer in a time in which cultural fealty was still paid to Europe. He was particularly active in forging bonds between composers in the United States and Latin America, Mexico especially. His most important steps as a promoter of new music included the founding, with Roger Sessions, of the Copland-Sessions Concerts in New York. He was the President of the American Composers Alliance from 1937 to 1945 and a member of the executive board of directors of the League of Composers. For 25 years a leading member of the faculty at the Berkshire Music Center at Tanglewood, he helkped, along with the Boston music director Serge Koussevitzky, to make that festival a center for contemporary music of all kinds and nationalities. In 1932, he directed the First Festival of Contemporary Music at Yaddo, the artists' colony in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. The festival included a selection of songs by Charles Ives, an important step in the revival of Ives's then-obscure music. Among the now-important composers that Mr. Copalnd encouraged in their formative years were Leonard Bernstein, Lukas Foss, David Diamond, Toru Takemitsu and David Del Tredici. It Was Jazz, And It Outraged Mr. Copland had his occasional detractors. In the 1920's, conservatvies criticized his use of jazz rhythms as tantamount to barbarism. At the Boston premiere of his Piano Concerto in 1926, audience members accused Koussevitzky of insulting them. Twenty-five years later, Mr. Copland offended dismay many listeners and many of his old champions by adopting, in his own manner, the very idiom they thought he stood staunchly against -- Schoenberg's 12- tone composition. Such works as the Piano Quartet (1950), the Piano Fantasy (1957), Connotations and Inscape (1967) have made their way more slowly into the repertory than his easily accessible works. In 1951 , Mr. Copland was the first American composer to deliver the Norton lectures at Harvard University. He lectured about American music throughout the world. Although not a prose stylist, he nonetheless produced many influential booka articles, especially in popular journals, about the lot of the composer in today's society. His books includied What to Listen For in Music (1939) , Our New Music (1941 , revised and published in 1968 as The New Music 1900-1960) and Music and Imagination (1952). In 1984 , Aaron Copland: 1900 through 1942 , an autobiography assembled from interviews conducted with the American musicologist Vivian Perlis , was published by St. Martin's Press. The second and final volume, Copland Since 1943 , appeared in 1989. Julia Smith , in her biographical study Aaron Copland: His Work and Contribution to American Music , called the composer this simple and great man in our midst. In an essay on Mr. Copland in his book American Music Since 1910 , Virgil Thomson observed , The Copland catalogue has good stuff under every heading , including opera.  ",

Not only is the study old, it 2019s vague 2014with the researchers broadly blaming the problem on 201cprocesses with opioid effect, 201d whatever that means. It was also tiny 2014relying on a sample group of just 20 kids. Finally, the study was admittedly single-blind, which means that the experimenters knew which kids were getting the special diet and which weren 2019t. Got bias? The second study came even earlier 2014in 1995, which is the dark ages of autism research 2014and it was almost as small, involving just 36 subjects. It detected no real link between dairy products and autism, instead finding only antibodies to milk proteins in the blood of autistic children. That suggests, well, who knows what? Association, as people who understand basic science will tell you, is not causation, and blood chemistry is only a broad, imprecise starting point for proving a link between any suspected cause and observed effect in research of this kind. Nineteen years after the paper was published, its authors have not moved one step closer to drawing that line between milk and autism 2014and neither have the thousands of other studies that have come since. PETA has been getting justifiably blowtorched for the ad since it was resurfaced by various media outlets in the last day. But even in light of the criticism and the science that shows no such effects of milk, the group stands by its insupportable claim, saying, in a statement, 201cPETA 2019s website provides parents with the potentially valuable information that researchers have backed up many families 2019 findings that a dairy-free diet can help kids with autism. 201d Look PETA, activism is easy; scaring people is easy; making parents feel guilty because they fed their autistic child a bowl of Cheerios and milk is easy. Science is hard 2014which is why not everyone gets to do it. Oh, and while we 2019re on that, you know what else is hard? Autism. It 2019s hard for the children who have it; it 2019s hard for the families wrestling with it; it 2019s hard for the researchers knocking themselves out every day to understand it and treat it and prevent it. They don 2019t need agitators and fabricators making things worse. There 2019s nothing wrong with protecting the animals, but try to do it without hurting the kids. Correction: The original version of this article misstated when the PETA campaign on milk and autism began.  ",

The 80-year-old, Oscar-winning film director has now cast Miley Cyrus and Elaine May in his 201960s-set Amazon series, EW has confirmed. Allen, who will serve as writer and director on the project, also will star in the six-episode series with Cyrus and May, according to Deadline, which first reported the news. May,83, starred in Allen 2019s 2000 film Small Time Crooks, which is her most recent acting credit. She also wrote such movies as Heaven Can Wait, The Birdcage, and Primary Colors and directed The Heartbreak Kid and Ishtar. The 23-year-old Cyrus, who starred in Hannah Montana before becoming a multi-platinum-selling singer, has starred in the films like The Last Song and LOL and guest-starred on Two and a Half Men. (A rep for Amazon would not comment for this story.) Allen seemed to have entered his Amazon series with more than a little trepidation, telling Deadline last year that the streamer pursued him intensely, even after he said that he didn 2019t have an idea for a series.

   "input": "NEWARK, March 4 - Charles Kushner, a multimillionaire real estate executive, philanthropist and one of the top Democratic donors in the country, was sentenced on Friday to two years in federal prison after pleading guilty to 18 counts of tax evasion, witness tampering and making illegal campaign donations. Mr. Kushner,50, built a construction business begun by his father into a private real estate empire that owned more than 25,000 apartments, millions of square feet of commercial and industrial space and thousands of acres of developable land. But Mr. Kushner also became embroiled in a bitter family feud over the business and how proceeds were distributed. That dispute, plus his growing prominence as a political financier, helped lead to his downfall. The intrafamily acrimony was such that Mr. Kushner retaliated against his brother-in-law, who was cooperating with federal authorities, by hiring a prostitute to seduce him. He then arranged to have a secretly recorded videotape of the encounter sent to his sister, the man's wife. The two-year sentence was the most Mr. Kushner could have received under a plea agreement, reached last September with the United States attorney, Christopher J. Christie, that called for 18 to 24 months in prison. But it was less than the sentence of nearly three years that Mr. Christie had sought in recent weeks after concluding that Mr. Kushner had failed to show acceptance of responsibility for his crimes as required by the plea deal. Details of that heated fight between prosecutors and Mr. Kushner's lawyers were unveiled in more than two and a half hours of argument on Friday before Judge Jose L. Linares in Federal District Court. In the end , the judge rejected the prosecution's argument but said he was nevertheless left with the difficult task of weighing the horrific nature of Mr. Kushner's acts against his sister and brother-in-law versus his many philanthropic acts in determining whether leniency was warranted. It is difficult for me to reconcile the generous man with the revengeful , hateful man, Judge Linares said. But I must take into consideration the vengeful nature in which this was done. In light of all the relevant circumstances , I find that you be imprisoned for 24 months. Mr. Kushner , dressed in a navy blue suit, white shirt and polka-dot tie, told the judge that while he did not believe he was as saintly as his lawyers and the letters sent to the judge on his behalf would suggest, neither was he as evil as the prosecution portrayed him. He nonetheless acknowledged that the actions which bring me before you today were disgraceful and reprehensible. Mr. Kushner , who will continue to be free on $5 million bail, was ordered to surrender on May 9 to begin serving his sentence at a federal prison at a military base in Montgomery, Ala. He was also ordered to pay a $40,000 fine. After the sentencing, Mr. Christie said he was pleased. It shows that no matter how rich and powerful you are in this state you will be prosecuted and punished for crimes you commit , he said. This sends a strong message that when you commit the vile and heinous acts that he has committed you will be caught and punished. Benjamin Brafman , Mr. Kushner's lead lawyer, said that while he was pleased that Judge Linares did not throw out the original plea deal's sentencing recommendations, he was angry and disappointed that the judge chose not to sentence his client to 18 months in prison. It disappoints me because I thought that after years of being one of the kindest and giving persons , it would matter in this state, Mr. Brafman said. It does matter in other states , but apparently it doesn't mean anything in this state. Mr. Kushner's lawyers provided Judge Linares with about 700 letters praising Mr. Kushner's charity and philanthropy , among them letters from people who had benefited from Mr. Kushner's acts, including schoolchildren and the sick. While Mr. Christie said that his investigation into Mr. Kushner's campaign contributions was continuing, the sentencing on Friday capped a rapid-fire series of events last summer in which Mr. Kushner, a major contributor to Gov. James E. McGreevey, was arrested, followed a week later by Mr. McGreevey's resignation after admitting to an adulterous homosexual affair. The arrest of a businessman who was so close to Mr. McGreevey had fueled speculation that the governor, already besieged by federal investigations of his campaigns, aides and other associates, was himself on the brink of political destruction at best and federal charges at worst. Mr. Kushner had put the man with whom Mr. McGreevey's aides said the governor had the affair, Golan Cipel, an Israeli citizen, on his payroll for a time. He also helped Mr. Cipel to get the United States work permits that allowed Mr. McGreevey to appoint him to a top counterterrorism post that he was later forced to quit. Mr. McGreevey appointed Mr. Kushner to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and nominated him to become its chairman, but Mr. Kushner quit after complaints were raised that his contributions to New Jersey Democrats may have violated campaign-finance and conflict-of-interest laws. In seeking the longer prison term, an assistant United States attorney, Scott Resnick, told Judge Linares that Mr. Kushner had failed to comply with subpoenas for business documents and had not presented sufficient proof that all the videotapes made of his brother-in-law and the prostitute had been turned over or destroyed. Rather than seeing these things as Mr. Kushner's failure to accept responsibility , Judge Linares faulted the prosecution for not securing stronger guarantees for compliance , and he accepted Mr. Kushner's assurance in court and in affidavits that the videotapes had been destroyed.

   "input": "After three years, Lowe 2019s is giving its Iris home automation hub a facelift, reducing the price, and expanding its capabilities. On Monday, it introduced a new hub to let people automate the lights, locks, cameras, and even pet doors in their homes. The chain store also wants to rebrand 201cfrom a home improvement retailer to a home improvement company, 201d says Mick Koster, who leads Lowe 2019s Iris home systems. That means the company plans to focus more on installing connected home products, as well as focus on providing recommendations to consumers related to home services like electricians and plumbers. The latest version of the Iris hub costs $59.99, down from $99.99. The price is $10 more than the corresponding Wink hub sold at rival Home Depot stores. Lowe 2019s is also reducing the number of premium plans it offers for the Iris hub from three to two. One is a paid plan costing $9.99 monthly that allows users to notify up to six people when an event occurs, create conditional rules for the devices (if my garage door opens, turn on the porch light), and store video for up to two weeks. The other is a free plan that lets users get notifications sent to their own phone, let users remotely control their gadgets, and stores video for 24 hours. Lowe 2019s was early in the home automation when it introduced the Iris platform in 2012. Since then, the company has pulled together a compelling array of connected devices that work with the hub. I 2019ve never been a huge fan of the Iris platform because the free features and the number of compatible devices felt too limited. Other options from SmartThings and other Do-It-Yourself hubs out there offered more. With the upgrade, Lowe 2019s has addressed some of those concerns. It works with 75 devices that are branded with the Lowe 2019s Iris name, up from a couple dozen. It also operates with Bluetooth, which means that it will likely add coming Bluetooth light bulbs and some of the new connected locks over time. The hub also supports the AllJoyn standard ,which means it should work with a surprising array of other devices outside of the hub. For example LG TVs support AllJoyn so an Iris hub might be able to one day send a message that an Iris water sensor noticed a leak to an LG TV in the house, letting someone get a message that their home was in danger of flooding even while immersed in watching the big game. And from a functionality and use perspective, the Iris platform does have good customer support and fairly intuitive software. What 2019s more interesting, is where Lowe 2019s intends to take the Iris platform and its retail strategy as consumers become more willing to purchase connected products. 201cObviously we are a DIY focused retailer, and we continue making Iris more intuitive and simpler to manage on your own, 201d said Koster. 201dBut we want to integrate more smart tech into other categories where it is relevant. 201d That might start with the addition of more obscure devices outside the Iris platform such as Wi-Fi enabled water heaters. Lowe 2019s plan is to sell services in addition to the Iris hub like home security monitoring, which costs $9.99 monthly. The idea is transform Lowe 2019s beyond its roots as a home improvement retailer into a company homeowners can go to directly for fixing problems with their homes. Koster cites Lowe 2019s involvement with Porch.com last year, as an example of this mindset. Porch.com offers recommendations to homeowners seeking services like plumbers or electricians. As more complicated devices such as water flow measurement sensors are offered, they require professional installation which Lowe 2019s could offer through Porch.com. Koster views connected devices, not as whiz-bang gadgets, but as devices that improves the home itself. 201cAs connectivity becomes omnipresent, that becomes just another check in the box of features, so we have look at how it adds to the value of our brand and the device, 201d Koster says. He declined to say how much money Lowe 2019s currently makes from Iris or from selling connected home devices. But he clearly thinks it will rise considering his interest in the market. Overall, he said that he expects prices for connected products to decline, so consumers won 2019t have to spend $250 for a connected thermostat forever. That 2019s good news for mainstream consumers who are interested in the technology. Of course, it 2019s also potentially good news for Lowe 2019s, which wants to help install and manage connected devices for customers.

The 34-year-old chief executive of DraftKings, the ascendant daily-fantasy-sports startup, is standing in a mammoth luxury suite high above the action. He has a perfect view of the field 2014but he 2019s glued to his smartphone.

You could say the same for the fantasy-sports business. The notion of playing general manager by assembling an imaginary sports team has been around since the 1960s, when a company called Strat-O-Matic created a card game based on the concept. Then, as now, gamers would 201cplay 201d a season based on the real-life performance of the players on their virtual team. Over time, websites replaced pencil and paper and made results instantaneous. Today, mobile applications threaten to replace websites. DraftKings, founded in 2012 and based in Boston, is one such app. FanDuel, founded in 2009 and based in New York, is another. Both companies have raised hundreds of millions of dollars (and garnered billion-dollar valuations) from blue-chip investors as they vigorously compete for eyeballs and wallets in an estimated $15 billion business. The Fantasy Sports Trade Association, created in 1997 to lobby for the industry, estimates that there are 57 million fantasy-sports participants in North America. This year 8 million of them are expected to try the shorter, more casual 201cdaily 201d version that DraftKings and FanDuel offer. How does it work?

By halftime the Patriots widen the gap to 14 20133. Through it all, DraftKings and FanDuel ads incessantly appear on the radio, on television, on billboards, on buses, on websites, and in apps. Still, both companies face a hurdle much larger than each other: the law. At issue is whether daily-fantasy-sports contests are indeed games of skill and not chance. Put simply, most states say they are. Five states 2014Arizona, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana, and Washington 2014disagree. In September, Frank Pallone, a U.S. Democratic congressman from New Jersey, called for a hearing on the legality of fantasy sports. Days later Massachusetts attorney general Maura Healey said her agency was also looking at the legal issues. Pressure comes from both sides: Pallone has advocated legal sports betting in his state; Healey is a vocal opponent of gambling. (For more on this issue, read: 201cAre DraftKings and FanDuel legal? 201d) If Robins is concerned, he doesn 2019t show it. He 2019s too busy taking it all in.

And the more the children saw the fast-food commercials, the more frequently they ate fast food. The study, performed by researchers from Dartmouth 2019s Geisel School of Medicine, focused on the advertising of Burger King and McDonald 2019s, the two major fast-food brands on ad-supported children 2019s networks, such as Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network. But the study concerned national advertising from 2009, and the youth-focused marketing practices of fast food have since then improved, by some measures. A 2013 report suggested that both McDonald 2019s and Burger King had scaled back their marketing toward children. Some practices still raise hackles, however. Earlier this year, the Children 2019s Advertising Review Unit, the regulatory body, reprimanded McDonald 2019s for a Happy Meal commercial in which a 201cTeenie Beanie Baby Boo 201d toy got a third of the screen time.

   "input": "The Life and Work of Richard Yates. Illustrated. 671 pp. New York: RICHARD YATES is one of literature's nearly men -- no loser but never quite an outright winner. Born into an impoverished and dysfunctional family (whose dysfunctions and monetary crises he reproduced, with Xerox fidelity, in his own roles of husband and father), he missed out on a university education. Throughout life he nursed a corrosive anger against novelists who had that advantage over him. ''I'd give anything to have gotten a college education,'' he exclaimed in later life. ''I feel the lack of it all the time.'' He was, as photographs (and innumerable sexual partners) confirm, strikingly handsome, but in a style that he himself despised. Yates privately thought his looks feminine. And he had, as Blake Bailey records in ''A Tragic Honesty,'' ''a lifelong horror of being perceived as homosexual.'' Despite a graceful appearance he was in his movements clumsy ''on a legendary scale.'' At school, as Yates said of one of his characters, ''the shower room was the worst part'' of his day. Morbid shyness afflicted him through life. Yates, born in 1926, served in World War II and was a single I.Q. point short of qualifying for officer training. He was discharged ''with a Good Conduct medal and the rank of private first class.'' He brought back no good war stories but, typically, he made good fiction out of the lack of them. His early and finest short story (as he liked to think), ''A Really Good Jazz Piano,'' was turned down nine times, with gushing praise, by the best magazines in the United States. Only the devoted persistence of his agent, Monica McCall, got it into print. Yates's first published novel, ''Revolutionary Road,'' had the misfortune to be a finalist for the National Book Award in 1962, an annus mirabilis for American fiction. It came up against ''Catch-22,'' ''Franny and Zooey,'' ''The Pawnbroker'' and ''The Moviegoer,'' which won. Budgeted by its publisher to sell 20,000 copies, Yates's novel went on to clear less than half that. On the strength of the award publicity, he was hired by the director John Frankenheimer to do a screenplay of his friend William Styron's ''Lie Down in Darkness.'' Had it come off, Yates might, like his other friend Brian Moore, have supported a career in quality fiction with quality film work. Alas, the project fell through. In later life, Yates taught creative writing (very well, apparently) at various universities. But he failed to get tenure at his main base, the University of Iowa -- something that embittered him inordinately. Bitterness stoically concealed -- except when in drink or mania -- was the flavor of his career. Yates had, as Bailey records, ''two great ambitions -- publication in The New Yorker and front-page notice by The New York Times Book Review.'' The first he never achieved (despite some of the most glowing rejections in literary history). Nor the second. He might have struck lucky with ''The Easter Parade'' (1976), but the review (a good one) ''ended up on Page 4.'' Nothing ever went quite right. A little luck mixed with his genius and Yates would be secure among the American immortals. He never had a best seller, never won the big prizes. He arrived slightly too late on the literary scene and was overtaken by what he contemptuously called the ''post-Realistic School.'' He survives by a process that the novelist Richard Ford sees as Masonic. Admiration for Yates, Ford says, is ''a sort of cultural-literary secret handshake among its devotees.'' Writers have always stood by him. One wonders whether it is their discreet lobbying that keeps so much of his work in print. Yates's reputation will not be damaged by this compulsively readable biography. Yates was, as Bailey portrays him, both a great writer and ''almost a parody of the self-destructive personality.'' He was a lifelong four-pack-a-day man. He chain smoked in a tuberculosis sanatorium and puffed on even when chained to oxygen cylinders, his lungs rotted with terminal emphysema. On at least one occasion he burned down his apartment, toasting his work in progress. His workplace in such apartments, during his years of divorced solitude, was spartan in its simplicity and gothic in its squalor. ''Visitors were struck by certain awful details to which Yates himself seemed oblivious: the bloodstains on his desk-chair cushion (from piles), the calm roaches in plain sight, nothing but bourbon and instant coffee in the tiny kitchen.'' His daily routine in later life was described by one of his daughters: ''He'd wake up tremendously hung over, and put himself together for about two hours. Then he wrote, and then he went out and got drunk for the rest of the day.'' Children of a failed sculptor mother and a failed singer, Yates and his sister spent their infancy flitting from apartment to apartment. It was, as he described it, a domestic environment smelling of ''mildew and cat droppings and Plasticine.'' In later years his mother, always hysterical, descended into alcoholism and eventual dementia. Her image -- ambivalently accented -- haunts his fiction. The one aesthetic pleasure Yates records in his boyhood is the movie theater, the hovel on his childhood heath. What saved him for literature was the good fortune of a few years at a private school, during one of the family's upswings. His experience at Avon Old Farms School is chronicled in his novel ''A Good School'' (1978). Here he learned to write for student magazines. Words, he discovered, came easily to him.  ",

   "input": "Two weeks after the Brexit referendum, analysts, editors and politicians are still grappling with its consequences. Most of the predictions range somewhere between gloomy and apocalyptic. Many warn that Britain 2019s vote to leave will trigger a series of copycat referendums across the European Union. The severity of market reactions, especially in some southern European countries, has been taken as an omen that the end of the euro may be near. In short, doomsayers argue that Brexit spells the beginning of the end for the European project. It does no such thing. Decades of joint lawmaking, policy coordination and economic integration have created manifold interdependencies between the EU countries in the areas of trade, investment, regulation and politics. Just as the U.K. cannot extricate itself from the EU overnight, so the rest of the EU cannot discard its many achievements quickly, even if it wanted to. While euroskepticism has risen in many countries, including the founding countries of France, Germany and the Netherlands, recent surveys show that most Europeans support EU initiatives in concrete areas, from managing migration to improving infrastructure and dealing with external threats. The EU has been hugely successful in removing barriers to the movement of goods, capital and people. But this integration has come at a time of major change in the global economy, felt most noticeably through the competitive pressures emanating from China and other emerging markets. No wonder many Europeans equate the EU with the larger forces of globalization. For those who feel left behind, Brussels has become the catch-all for their fears and anger. In the face of such sentiments, European leaders cannot simply push ahead with more EU integration. Nor is a 201cfresh start, 201d consisting perhaps of a rapid round of eurozone expansion or the establishment of a political union, necessary to preserve the EU 2019s achievements. If anything, such efforts, if rushed, could intensify the populist backlash. Several recent trends go against the federalists 2019 vision of an ever-closer union. But, if reinforced, they could lead to a more flexible, resilient and politically acceptable EU. First, in a heterogeneous group of 27 countries, integration will inevitably take place on different levels and at different speeds. Some countries take part in the Schengen agreement on borderless travel, share a single currency and participate in building a banking union. Others do not. This variable integration process makes the EU more complex, but it also leaves room for national political developments to be taken into account. The EU needs to reconsider the principle that all countries should move at the same speed. Second, many European voters feel that the EU is a bureaucratic behemoth with a built-in bias toward more regulation, and they do not like it. That message is starting to register at the top. More and more European politicians are calling for the EU to respect the principle of subsidiarity, which requires that the EU take decisions only in areas where it clearly adds value, while leaving others to the national, regional or local levels. The current European Commission under President Jean-Claude Juncker has also changed tack by introducing fewer new laws and reviewing existing ones that may have become superfluous or counterproductive. Most importantly, the EU must dispel the belief that integration reinforces the pressures of globalization. If Brussels is looking for a new narrative to replace the vision of an ever-closer union, it would have to be this: The EU isn 2019t the cause of globalization, nor is it responsible for the repercussions on job markets or income distribution. Instead, it can help to alleviate and navigate these forces. Responsibility for managing the consequences of globalization and technological change remains mainly with Europe 2019s national governments. But there is much the EU can do to help. Many policies and programs exist that could be used to better effect, including Europe-wide cooperation in research and education, and training programs for unemployed youth. Funds for cross-border infrastructure, including digital networks, venture capital for startups and support for the Union 2019s weaker regions. Such measures are not a quick fix. But if the EU stops talking and starts delivering, its crisis of legitimacy could abate over time. The EU 2019s coming achievements will be more piecemeal and less spectacular than the big integration treaties and new institutions of the past 60 years. But perhaps a period of consolidation is what 2019s needed to preserve the EU 2019s achievements in the long run. While the EU should do less in some areas, most notably in regulation, it could do more in providing concrete support for the disappointed and disaffected. For investors and businesspeople, that means lowering the bar for judging the EU 2019s success. There is no need to panic if the next EU summit fails to agree on an eye-catching new integration plan. That could just mean the EU is finally beginning to learn the real lessons of the Brexit vote. Mr. Heise is the chief economist at Allianz SE .  ",

Megaupload, founded in 2005, had boasted of having more than 150 million registered users and 50 million daily visitors. At one point, it was estimated to be the 13th most frequently visited website on the internet. Dotcom, who announced his plans in a series of tweets on Friday, said most of the Megaupload users would get their accounts reinstated with premium privileges. He also hinted and that the new website will use bitcoins. Dotcom did not immediately respond to a mail seeking comment. Dotcom and three others were arrested on Jan. 20,2012, after armed New Zealand police raided his country estate at the request of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation. U.S. authorities had said Dotcom and three other Megaupload executives cost film studios and record companies more than $500 million and generated more than $175 million by encouraging paying users to store and share copyrighted material, such as movies and TV shows. Dotcom, who has New Zealand residency, has denied charges of internet piracy and money laundering and has been fighting extradition to the United States. He has contended that the website was merely a storage facility for online files and should not be held accountable if stored content was obtained illegally. A New Zealand court in 2013 granted Dotcom access to all evidence seized by police in the raid of his house. While Kim Dotcom 2019s net worth was not known, he became well known for his lavish lifestyle as much as his computer skills. He used to post photographs of himself with cars having vanity plates such as 201cGOD 201d and 201cGUILTY, 201d shooting an assault rifle and flying around the world in his private jet. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation estimated in 2012 that Dotcom personally made around $115,000 a day during 2010.

To hear co-founder and CEO Rony Abovitz tell it, in an interview with Fortune 2018s Michal Lev-Ram at the Brainstorm Tech conference on Tuesday, what Magic Leap is building will be as far beyond Google Glass as the Apollo moon landing was from the original Mercury space program. 201cI give Google a huge amount of credit for jumping in, but we 2019re doing things that are fundamentally different, 201d Abovitz told attendees at the Fortune conference in Aspen, Colo. 201cBut we did learn a lot from them, and they 2019ve been very helpful in sharing both the good and the bad from that with us. 201d While companies like Facebook-owned Oculus Rift and Samsung 2019s GearVR create virtual or augmented reality using a headset, Abovitz says that Magic Leap 2019s 201clight-field 201d technology essentially mimics the brain 2019s visual-perception mechanisms to create objects and even people who look and behave just the way they would in the real world, and interact with that world seamlessly. 201cOur system basically replicates how your eyes and brain work, how our neuro-visual system is designed to work, and it turns your brain into this kind of display, 201d Abovitz said. 201cSo the idea is not to have a display that you look at, but to use the display that nature gave us and talk directly to it. 201d So while VR generates a virtual world that you look at on a head-mounted display, and augmented reality creates a kind of 201cTerminator-style heads-up display, 201d the Magic Leap founder said his technology 201ccreates a neurologically-true light-field that simulates actual reality. 201d Using this technology, Abovitz said Magic Leap can not merely create realistic-looking objects that users can interact with in the real world, but it can also allow for other kinds of behavior. While the early applications are all games or entertainment, he said the company is also looking at business applications and commerce-related features as well. 201cSo my system could recognize that I 2019m looking at your sweater, and then an alert pops up from Amazon or Alibaba, and it says if you buy it now you can get 10% off, 201d said chief marketing officer Brian Wallace. Or a user could see at a glance how a new couch might look in their living room, and then buy it. Abovitz, who also co-founded and sold a bio-medical device company called Mako Surgical for $1.65 billion, said that he and his investors are also excited about the possible medical applications that such a technology could offer, from diagnosis to actual treatment. Abovitz said he has been thinking about and working on ideas related to Magic Leap since he was a child. Magic Leap now has over 600 people working for the company, many of whom are building and developing the technology in a former Motorola complex in Florida, where the company is based.

   "input": "After nearly a year of debate, five months of primaries, 17 candidates, and much sniping, the Republican National Convention will finally begin on Monday in Cleveland, with Donald Trump and Mike Pence set to be formally nominated as the presidential and vice presidential nominees for the Republican Party. Here 2019s everything you need to know: For the prime time speeches, every major network 2014 NBC, ABC, FOX, CBS, and PBS 2014 will be airing the convention live. You 2019ll also be able to watch coverage on the major cable news networks like CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC. If you 2019re a true convention nerd, though, and you want to watch the actual convention happenings all day for four days, the place to go is CSPAN. The cable channel, which normally shows live happenings within the halls of Congress, will have gavel-to-gavel coverage of the convention. For the cord-cutters out there, there are plenty of options. Many news channels will be streaming the speeches on their websites, and CBS is working with Twitter to air the convention via the social network. CSPAN will be airing its coverage via Facebook Live. While the speaker list is tentative and subject to change, here is who you should be watching for on each night of the convention. Monday: As is tradition, the biggest speech on Monday night will be made by the spouse of the candidate; in this case, Melania Trump. Melania is a non-traditional first lady, being a former model and a naturalized immigrant, so this speech could offer a signal of the role she 2019ll play in the campaign going forward. Other major speakers on Monday include former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Iowa Senator and Tea Party favorite Joni Ernst, and Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton. Tuesday: The most prominent speaker on the second day of the convention will likely be Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who ran against Trump during the primaries. One of the most unorthodox speakers, UFC President Dana White, will also address the RNC on Tuesday. And two of Trump 2019s children, Tiffany and Donald Jr., will speak on Tuesday. Wednesday: The biggest speech on Wednesday will come from Indiana Governor Mike Pence, in his acceptance speech of the vice presidential nomination. Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich will also address the convention on Wednesday. The most fascinating speech, though, may come from Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who came in second in the Republican nominating process. Cruz hasn 2019t formally endorsed Trump, and the tone of his speech may be a setup for a potential presidential run in 2020, if Trump were to lose in 2016. Eric Trump, Donald 2019s son, will also speak on Wednesday. Thursday: The biggie on Thursday will be Donald Trump himself. Ivanka Trump, his daughter, who has been very visible on the campaign trail, will also speak. Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, will take the stage, as will Peter Thiel, the tech entrepreneur who is a staunch libertarian and is a delegate for Trump from California. A number of prominent Republicans have decided not to travel to Cleveland this week. This includes former Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. It also includes former Republican presidential nominees Sen. John McCain of Arizona and former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts. Some of those who ran against Trump in the nominating process, including Jeb Bush, John Kasich, Rand Paul, and Lindsay Graham, also won 2019t be there. A number of prominent Republican senators, including Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Jeff Flake of Arizona, are also skipping the event. The biggest story of the convention will be similar to the story of the entire campaign 2014 which Donald Trump is going to show up? At times, Trump has been able to dial down his brash personality. He 2019s given speeches from a teleprompter, and he 2019s refrained from name-calling and personal attacks. Other times, he 2019s focused on petty grievances and behaved like an angry child. If the Republicans have any hope of coming out of this convention unified and on a path toward victory, the first Trump had better show up. There are still plenty of Republicans with serious questions about Trump. Many of them will be in Cleveland, some as delegates. While an attempted coup in the GOP rules committee seems to have been thwarted, it 2019s an open question if any of the dyed-in-the-wool conservative RNC attendees will cause a commotion. What impact will Pence have? As far as VP picks go, Mike Pence is pretty boring. He 2019s an older white guy from a Midwestern state who made his bones as a fierce advocate for Christian conservative values. Socially conservative positions, especially those that relate to gay marriage, aren 2019t the reliably resonant wedge issues they once were for the Republicans. Pence is also a fairly establishment figure running alongside a fiercely anti-establishment Donald Trump. In the end, vice presidential candidates are largely inconsequential to election outcomes, because voters largely cast their ballots with the top of the ticket in mind. An especially weak appearance from Pence, though, could hurt Trump among undecided voters watching at home. What will be going on outside the convention? The controversies that have followed Trump throughout his campaign 2014 his comments about Muslims and Mexicans, and his popularity among white nationalists in particular 2014 seem primed to come to a head. Groups on both sides, including the New Black Panthers and the Oathkeepers, have promised to come armed. And they 2019ll be allowed to carry their weapons without hassle from the police, thanks to open carry laws in Ohio. While convention protest activity never quite seems to live up to the hype, the streets may be quite chaotic this year. Can the GOP get on track? It has been a tough election season for the Republicans. The party 2019s primary season was messy, yielding a winner with only marginal connections to the party. Many of the party elders are questioning the future of the GOP. If the convention is disciplined, on message, and smooth, polls could show a bounce for Trump and signs of life for the party. If it is an amateur hour, though, more independents and moderate Republicans could defect to Hillary Clinton or simply choose to stay home on election day.  ",

Jorge 00e2 0080 0094not his real name 00e2 0080 0094agreed to speak to us under the condition of anonymity. The following are excerpts from our conversation with him. Fault Lines: How do people find you? Do they call you saying, I need someone to take me? 00e2 0080 009d Jorge: When someone calls me , they say someone recommended me to them. I tell them:It's a tough journey , but if you want to do it I will explain to you how things are. If you get caught, I can take you back if the mistake was made by the guides. But if things go wrong because you ran away or you did something stupid, I won't take the responsibility. If you agree with these terms I will do it. If not, then find someone else. So they are told the deal ahead of time. Up to this day nobody has complained about me. Why do you think that the amount of children leaving doubled in just one year? They are taking advantage , because they are granting them permission in Texas. If they get you, they call your relatives, they get you a plane ticket and send you over to them just like that. And you don't have to deal with walking through the desert. I don't know why they created the law, but it's convenient for children. Everyone took advantage and sent them over. Some coyotes charge less because they know if you turn yourself into immigration, there is no problem. You will always go through. But others take advantage and charge them the normal rate and they deliver them to immigration. When they realized they could do that, everyone took advantage and left. But they only grant permission to mothers with children. Some people have said that the coyotes told them to go because they would be able to stay. Do you think that is what happened? In parts, yes. But only in the case of children and women or minors accompanied by an adult. All the coyotes know that, and they are making money from that. They are all in the game. I imagine there are good coyotes and there are others who throw you wherever and don't care. There are all kinds. There are good ones, and there are bad ones. Some are corrupt and others are honest. It's like with every kind of business. Some are like rats. They take your money and they leave you wherever. In the past ten months,66,000 kids have entered the U.S. 00e2 0080 0094not just from El Salvador, but also from Honduras and Guatemala. Do you think more kids are leaving because of the violence in El Salvador? Moms or fathers or uncles, they know that here there is a load of gangsters, and they are recruiting kids to turn them into gangsters. They don't want their kids to end up in a gang. That's why they are sending so many children away. Because when the gangsters find out you have family in the U.S., they write you notes and tell you if you don't pay them a certain sum of money, they will screw you over. Gangs are everywhere. Who says anything? Nobody. It needs to stop. They beat people up, steal from them, charge them fees. So it's a lot of money to get to the U.S.? Ten thousand dollars, $8,000 00e2 0080 0094it depends how much the person is willing to give. They pay a part here, a part on the way and the rest at the end. You get to keep $2,000. And that is a good amount. With three, you make $6,000. Yes, but it's a tough journey. What precautions do you take when you take people to Mexico? I 00e2 0080 0099ve known the way since I was young. You get to know people on the streets that are honest and that are corrupt. So I go with the people I know who are loyal. I get in touch with them and tell them I want to take these people from here to there. They do everything. If they need to pay immigration, they tell you, Yes , this is doable, but the police are charging this much, the feds are charging this much. 00e2 0080 009d I give money to that guy, and he pays the authorities, and they let them through. Nobody stops them because the authorities get paid to let them through. Do you take precautions when you take unaccompanied children? Or is it the same? Everyone takes care of children. Even if they are drug dealers or whatever. Some people are not good to them and treat them as if they were cattle or poultry. Do people still call you to travel? It has gone down. Because it's got tougher. Because the Zetas are killing people in Mexico. There are people who still want to leave, but it's not the same as before. And it's not convenient to us anymore. Now everyone wants to charge a fee and people don't want to pay more. The U.S. is now asking all the countries to be tougher and to not let people leave. What do you think about the U.S. putting pressure on Mexico here and there to stop? There is no pressure from the U.S. on Mexico. That is a lie. Anyone can go through Mexico 00e2 0080 0094whoever carries money. They probably catch two or three, so they say they are working. But how many buses leave here every day?  ",

But the fact is, good quality untreated gemstones are very rare, the earth will not keep producing these stones, while the demand for them just keeps on growing. Here is my pick of the sale highlights. Lot 1932: A spectacular oval diamond, the largest diamond ever to appear at auction.118.28cts D colour, flawless type IIaEstimate: in the region of US$28 - 35millionRealised: $30,600,000 ( 00a319,40,141) World record price for a white diamond I had the wonderful opportunity to view this stone with my loupe. It is so perfect that I was trying to look for any small imperfections that would make me feel it was real 2026 the only thing I could find was that the faceted girdle (the stone 2019s edge) was slightly uneven 2013 seeing that seemed to give the stone character. Discovered in Southern Africa in 2011 - a whopping 299 carats in the rough - after months and months of careful cutting to achieve perfection they had to loose 60 per cent of the weight. Type IIa, which for all those wondering means that the diamond crystal is made with pure carbon without any trace of nitrogen, which happens to be about 2 per cent of the world 2019s diamond production. The lucky owner will be able to name the stone, and become part of the 2018Over 100 Carat Club 2019. Lot 1925: The world 2019s largest round fancy vivid blue diamond, The Premier Blue7.59cts internally flawlessRealised: Unsold These are a freak of nature created when boron - a trace element -gets into the carbon crystal lattice and turns the diamond a blue colour making it a Type IIb. Other famous blue diamonds are the Hope, The Wittlesbach-Graff (previously the Wittlesbach) and the Tereschenko. Coloured diamonds are extremely rare indeed and to get a colour that is true blue without displaying any grey is exceptional.The record price per carat for a blue diamond is the 5.3 ct Fancy deep-blue diamond sold at Bonhams, London in April 2013 with a record $1.8million per carat. So the battle is on. Lot 1766: Ruby and diamond ring by Cindy ChaoSet with an oval Burmese ruby weighing 8.03cts in 18 carat white and blackened gold Estimate: 00a32.3 2013 2.723 millionRealised: $3,843,306 ( 00a32,390,747) Cindy Chao is an exciting new artist who strives for perfection with stunning results. Born in Taiwan into an artistic family, her father was a sculptor and this led her to develop her skills as a jewellery wax molder where she strives to achieve precision so she can get the prototype just how she wants it before giving it to her craftsmen.Chao's pieces are already highly sought after, each one of a kind, sometimes taking a year to complete a jewel from the initial design. She has successfully combined the use of modern technology alongside traditional skills. Having said all this, the majority of this estimate for the ring is reflected in the Burma Ruby 2013 where all the best rubies come from. Lot 1725: Conch pearl and diamond necklaceEstimate: 00a3200- 230kRealised: Unsold These conch pearls (pronounced conk) as the name suggests come from the Queen Conch shell. They are the shell that you see in old films set in the Caribbean or Hawaii where they are being blown into to make a horn sounding noise.The magnification of a conch pearl shows the flame-like pattern known as 201cchatoyancy 201d. Some people mix these up with pink coral, but if you look closely, the surface patterns are very different. Lot 1892: Rare melo and diamond hair ornament by Cartier, measuring 27.48 - 28.40mmEstimate: 00a3107.5 2013 123kRealised: 00a3128,362 There is a thirst for the unusual and these rare pearls from various pearl producing mollusks are very sought after. This melo pearl, which has an orangey creamy colour, comes from the Baler shell which live mainly in the South China Sea and off Singapore and Malaysia.There are some you can see in the Pearls exhibition at the Victoria & Albert Museum. Lot 1927: Natural pearl necklace, 11.60 - 7.70mmEstimate: 00a3743 2013 908kRealised: Unsold Natural saltwater pearls are still soaring in price. In the last 5 years they have probably increased by at least 300 per cent. The pearls do have to have a very good skin and luster though, which some people call the 201corient 201d. Oysters cannot grow in polluted waters and most of the saltwater pearl beds, if not all, are now extinct. Where they used to grow you 2019ll now mostly find oil rigs. Lot 1654: Multi-coloured jadeite, gem-set and diamond brooch, signed by Mason TsaiEstimate: 00a313.3 2013 16.5kRealised: Unsold Chosen for a bit of fun, I find it quite charming and guarantee it would start any conversation when worn. This is a brooch to wear if you are a bit shy and want your jewellery to do the introductions for you. I would like to wear both together... Lot 1897: Lavender Jadeite BangleEstimate: 00a3562 2013 660kRealised: 00a3580,839 There is a wonderful intensity of colour and because jade is quite hard it would be quite safe to wear. I love this colour and with jade 2019s greasy oily surface it seems to always glow. Lot 1896: Fine Jadeite BangleEstimate: 00a3454 2013 578kRealised: unsold This is an extremely translucent jadeite bangle of a rich emerald green colour which is what you look for. Sometimes it is described as 201capple green 201d jade or Imperial jade. Asia has a special infinity with jade and the Hong Kong sale has some rather spectacular pieces with some astonishing estimates. Imperial Jade has been mined in Burma for hundreds of years and at first it was used for tools and weapons, until 2000BC when China started to revere jade as talismanic.  ",

He was 96. The cause was respiratory failure resulting from pneumonia, his family said. A self-described emotional and physical wreck while growing up in the San Francisco area, Mr. LaLanne began turning his life around, as he often told it, after hearing a talk on proper diet when he was 15. He started working out with weights when they were an oddity, and in 1936 he opened the prototype for the fitness spas to come 2014 a gym, juice bar and health food store 2014 in an old office building in Oakland. 201cPeople thought I was a charlatan and a nut, 201d he remembered. 201cThe doctors were against me 2014 they said that working out with weights would give people heart attacks and they would lose their sex drive. 201d But Mr. LaLanne persevered, and he found a national pulpit in the age of television. 201cThe Jack LaLanne Show 201d made its debut in 1951 as a local program in the San Francisco area, then went nationwide on daytime television in 1959. His short-sleeved jumpsuit showing off his impressive biceps, his props often limited to a broomstick, a chair and a rubber cord, Mr. LaLanne pranced through his exercise routines, most notably his fingertip push-ups. He built an audience by first drawing in children who saw his white German shepherd, Happy, perform tricks. 201cMy show was so personal, I made it feel like you and I were the only ones there, 201d he told Knight-Ridder Newspapers in 1995. 201cAnd I 2019d say: 2018Boys and girls, come here. Uncle Jack wants to tell you something. You go get Mother or Daddy, Grandmother, Grandfather, whoever is in the house. You go get them, and you make sure they exercise with me. 2019 201d His show continued into the mid-1980s. 201cHe was perfect for the intimacy of television, 201d Robert Thompson, a professor of television and popular culture at Syracuse University, told The San Jose Mercury News in 2004. 201cThis guy had some of the same stuff that Oprah has and Johnny Carson had 2014 the ability to insinuate themselves in the domestic space of people 2019s lives. 201d Long before Richard Simmons and Jane Fonda and the Atkins diet, Mr. LaLanne was a national celebrity, preaching regular exercise and proper diet. Expanding on his television popularity, he opened dozens of fitness studios under his name, later licensing them to Bally. He invented the forerunners of modern exercise machines like leg-extension and pulley devices. He marketed a Power Juicer to blend raw vegetables and fruits and a Glamour Stretcher cord, and he sold exercise videos and fitness books. He invited women to join his health clubs and told the elderly and the disabled that they could exercise despite their limitations. At 60 he swam from Alcatraz Island to Fisherman 2019s Wharf handcuffed, shackled and towing a 1,000-pound boat. At 70, handcuffed and shackled again, he towed 70 boats, carrying a total of 70 people, a mile and a half through Long Beach Harbor. He ate two meals a day and shunned snacks. Breakfast, following his morning workout, usually included several hard-boiled egg whites, a cup of broth, oatmeal with soy milk and seasonal fruit. For dinner he took his wife, Elaine, to restaurants that knew what he wanted: a salad with raw vegetables and egg whites along with fish 2014 often salmon 2014 and a mixture of red and white wine. He sometimes allowed himself a roast turkey sandwich, but never a cup of coffee. Mr. LaLanne said he performed his exercises until he experienced 201cmuscle fatigue, 201d lifting weights until it was impossible for him to continue. It produced results and, as he put it, 201cthe ego in me 201d made the effort worthwhile. The son of French immigrants, Jack LaLanne was born in San Francisco on Sept. 26,1914, and spent his early years on his parents 2019 sheep farm in Bakersfield, Calif. By the time he was 15, the family having moved to the Bay Area, he was pimply and nearsighted, craved junk food and had dropped out of high school. That is when his mother took him to a women 2019s club for a talk by Paul C. Bragg, a well-known speaker on health and nutrition. That talk, Mr. LaLanne often said, turned his life around. He began experimenting with weights at the Berkeley Y.M.C.A., tossed aside cakes and cookies and studied Gray 2019s Anatomy to learn about the body 2019s muscles. He graduated from a chiropractic school, but instead of practicing that profession he became a pitchman for good health. He opened his first health studio when he was 21, and a decade and a half later he turned to television. He was first sponsored by the creator of a longevity pill, a 90-year-old man, but it sold poorly and he obtained Yami Yogurt as his new sponsor. 201cIt tasted terrible, so I mixed it with prune juice and fruits, 201d he told The New York Times in 2004. 201cNobody thought about it until then. We made the guy a millionaire. 201d Mr. LaLanne, 5-foot-6 and 150 pounds or so with a 30-inch waist, maintained that he disliked working out. He said he kept at it strictly to feel fit and stay healthy. He built two gyms and a pool at his home in Morro Bay, and began each day, into his 90s, with two hours of workouts: weight lifting followed by a swim against an artificial current or in place, tied to a belt. 201cThe Jack LaLanne Show 201d may have run its course in the mid-1980s, but it had a second life in reruns on ESPN Classic. 201cWe have over 3,000 shows, 201d Mr. LaLanne said in 2004. 201cI own everything. 201d In September 2007, 201cJack LaLanne Live! 201d made its debut on the online VoiceAmerica Health and Wellness Radio Network. He appeared on it with his wife and his nephew Chris LaLanne, a personal trainer. In addition to his wife, Elaine, Mr. LaLanne is survived by their son, Jon, of Hawaii; his daughter, Yvonne LaLanne, of Walnut Creek, Calif., from his previous marriage, and a stepson, Dan Doyle, of Los Angeles, from Elaine LaLanne 2019s previous marriage. Mr. LaLanne promoted himself and his calling into his final years, often accompanied at events by his wife, a physical fitness convert but hardly a fanatic. He brimmed with optimism and restated a host of aphorisms for an active and fit life. 201cI can 2019t die, 201d he most famously liked to say. 201cIt would ruin my image. 201d A version of this article appears in print on January 24,2011, on page A25 of the New York edition with the headline: Jack LaLanne,96, Fitness 2019s Father, Dies.

The study could not say whether blacks, Hispanics and American Indians are more likely to commit crimes and thus be arrested, but they are more likely to be arrested once stopped, the research finds. The study doesn't claim to be the last word on whether police are unfairly targeting blacks, but does shed some light on an issue that's been made volatile in recent months with cellphone videos that show upsetting incidents, said Ted Miller of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation in Maryland, who led the study. I wanted to better inform the discussion , said Miller , an economist specializing in public health. Related: Police Shoot Unarmed Caregiver With His Hands Up His team pulled together statistics from wherever they could find them: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, FBI, state police websites, hospital records and two investigative series by the Washington Post and Guardian newspapers. U.S. police killed or injured an estimated 55 ,400 people in 2012, they wrote in the journal Injury Prevention. Blacks , Native Americans and Hispanics had higher stop arrest rates per 10, 000 population than white non-Hispanics and Asians. Rates are important because they take into account each group's proportion of the population. Blacks make up about 13 percent of the U.S. population , but accounted for 28 percent of arrests.

There are many violent interactions , Miller found. On an average day , three people die and 150 people are treated at a hospital because they are injured by police, Miller told NBC News. Related: Michael Jordan Speaks Out on Race Issues During 2012 an estimated 67 ,000 law enforcement personnel were assaulted, with an estimated 18, 600 medically treated for injury and 48 killed. But once they stopped someone , police were just as likely to hurt or injure whites as people of any other race, they found. Blacks have high arrest and stop rates , and per capita [among the general population] are much more likely than whites to die at the hands of police, the team found. However , when blacks are stopped or arrested, they are no more likely than whites to be injured or die during that incident. RELATED: Percent saying blacks are treated less fairly than whites Consistent with our findings , simulation studies find police are no more likely to fire on unarmed blacks than unarmed whites, and high rates of black speeding citations per capita result from high violation rates, the team wrote , . A systematic review identified 10 studies that found suspect race ethnicity did not predict use of force or its escalation. So now the important question to answer will be whether that increased rate of stop and arrest is unfair or biased , Miller said. He was not able to find out if police were more likely to stop blacks for trivial reasons 2014 although they were more likely to let whites go once stopped. We know that low-income neighborhoods have more crime , Miller said. And minorities are more likely to have low incomes. Some disparities could be due to income rather than race , he said. And it could be that fear of police violence has caused blacks to be more polite than whites in their interactions. Related: African-American Cops React to Violence Frequent police stops of young men have caused many black and some Hispanic mothers to teach their sons where to put their hands if approached by an officer , how to move and not move, to ask permission before reaching for their wallet, and to respond to police rudeness with respect, the team wrote. Those talks may have protective effects. There's another factor. Most of the people who die had a gun with them , Miller said. He compared the U.S. situation to Australia , where just as many people are injured, but fewer are shot to death in police stops. Australia has much stricter laws on carrying guns than the U.S. has. Police aren't as scared. The police are not as endangered , he said. RELATED: Poll - Police use of deadly force But Miller said the statistics show that there is far too much violence when police stop Americans in general , and he said it's up to police to do something about that. You and I might get stopped once in our lives. The police stop people every day. They need to be the ones trained to de-escalate , he said. It's important for people not to make police angry , but it's also important for police to control their emotions, Miller said. The question is how to make the system forgiving enough so that when somebody makes a mistake , everybody lives, he said.

   "input": "The attorneys general of New York and Massachusetts are approaching daily fantasy sports companies quite differently. Last week, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sent cease-and-desist letters to DraftKings and FanDuel, the market-share leaders in the industry, demanding they stop taking paid entries in the state. FanDuel has since complied; DraftKings has not. Both companies have filed lawsuits against Schneiderman, and a legal showdown is set for November 25. In contrast, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced on Thursday her proposed set of new regulations for daily fantasy operators in that state. Rather than make them illegal, as Schneiderman wants to do, Healey proposes regulating them closely. Her most significant proposal is that playing be restricted to ages 21 and older, and that users be limited to depositing $1,000 a month. The latter rule would significantly hamper revenues for daily fantasy companies in that state. But both DraftKings and FanDuel quickly released statements voicing support for Healey 2019s plan, which is clearly much friendlier than Schneiderman 2019s. DraftKings called the proposal 201ca thoughtful and comprehensive approach. 201d FanDuel said it 201cmakes a tremendous amount of sense. 201d Healey also wants the companies banned from marketing on college campuses, a position that has already gained momentum in other corners. One of ESPN 2019s channels, the SEC Network, recently stopped running the DraftKings and FanDuel ads that the main ESPN channel shows. And the NCAA recently announced it would ban the companies from advertising during championship events. Healey 2019s full list contains 14 bullet-point rules, in four sections: 201cProtecting minors 201d; 201cLeveling the playing field: 201d 201cAdvertising and marketing; 201d and 201cFinancial protections. 201d Healey 2019s office cannot implement the new regulations immediately. Instead, it must accept public comments through January before making her proposals final. Thanks to the public comment period, the process will play out under a public microscope. In an exclusive and candid phone call Thursday evening with Fortune, Healey spoke further about her views on the fantasy sports industry and her steps to regulate it. What follows is an edited transcript. Fortune: These companies have been around for a few years but the flood of scrutiny didn 2019t come until now. Do you think it was the scandal last month that did it, with a DraftKings employee winning money on FanDuel, or was it their advertising assault? What alerted you? Maura Healey: I agree. They 2019ve been around for a bit, but then they had this huge ad buy and everywhere you went, my impression is that even people with no interest in sports, you couldn 2019t get away from them. We started looking at this several months ago, back in the late spring and through the summer. Certainly our review continued and continues to this day, but it 2019s something we have had on our screen here for quite a while. We have a gaming division in the office, and my gaming division was aware of the development of daily fantasy sports and what they were out there trying to do in the market, and so we started looking at it. We reached out to the companies, requested meetings with them, and over the last few months have been back and forth with them. How much time have you spent with both companies? We spent time with both companies in person. I can 2019t say the exact number of meetings, but there were multiple meetings, multiple telephone conversations, and I think real ample opportunity for us to get a sense of how this industry operates and what their business model is. How much have the actions of other states affected your actions? Has it made you hurry up? We are just focused on our own review and making sure we feel comfortable we are protecting players in Massachusetts. Frankly, what other states are doing or looking at or the actions they are taking is not something we take account of. We look at our own laws, look at consumer protection issues, and make sure we establish what doesn 2019t yet exist here, which is a legal and regulatory framework to address this industry. We were looking at this issue well before there were allegations of 2018insider trading. 2019 But I think, as you said, it certainly was a catalytic event in terms of inspiring or leading to, it appears, any number of investigations and reviews by offices across the country. But look, we recognized this was an issue several months ago and we undertook our review at that point. And we have moved as expeditiously as possible. Not because of anything other than the fact that our governor, legislature, and consumers in Massachusetts are wondering what the rules are. So I thought it was important our office undertake a careful review and make our findings available as soon as possible. And they are robust consumer protections. I think they 2019re also fair. I think they reflect an understanding of the industry. I 2019m sure not everyone will agree, but we 2019ll see. You 2019ve said that you believe playing daily fantasy is in fact gambling, but you want to regulate the companies, not make them illegal. Some people seem to see that as a contradiction. But those views 2013 thinking it 2019s gambling but thinking it should be legal, if regulated 2013 are not mutually exclusive, right? You 2019ve got it right. I think a lot of people looking at this would call it gambling. I 2019ve called it gambling. The question is whether it 2019s gambling that currently fits within an existing legal and regulatory framework? And my response is that is something we need to create. And even people in the industry have agreed they need to be regulated. So I don 2019t see those as being mutually exclusive. Do you think the companies have been forced to misrepresent themselves 2014to insist they are not gambling when they should have said from the start they were gambling operators? Well, a couple of things here. Here 2019s the context in which we operate in Massachusetts: There was a 2006 federal law that addressed Internet gaming. It specifically carved out fantasy sports and left it to states to regulate. Five states have banned daily fantasy sports, Massachusetts is not among those states. [Author 2019s note: Those five states are Arizona, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana and Washington, but not all of those states outright banned it. DraftKings and FanDuel chose to not operate in those states because the law appears to be unfriendly. In addition, Nevada recently ruled that fantasy sports sites are gambling operators, so the companies do not currently operate in that state either.] Now, we have the original anti-lottery, anti-gambling statute here in Massachusetts, and I don 2019t think it is clear that that applies to this new industry that was never envisioned. That said, the way for us to take immediate action here in this state and protect young people is to put out these regulations. Different offices have different tools at their disposal and may approach it differently. I respect that. I 2019m just doing what I think is best for consumers here. Our consumer protections would require adequate disclosures in their marketing, and financial protections so that people do not lose their shirts. Your predecessor, former Mass Attorney General Martha Coakley, is now an adviser to DraftKings. Has that had an impact, have you talked to her about the industry or met with her? Our office has not talked to her about it. She is in fact precluded from that under ethics rules. She has a one-year-off period before she can engage with this office. So the fact of the matter is, we haven 2019t spoken with her at all. The companies have quite a lot of lawyers 2014we 2019ve been working with them. Are you eager to see other states follow your lead here? I think we have proposed a robust roadmap here for Massachusetts. To the extent other states are interested in copying that, we 2019ll see what happens. I wouldn 2019t be surprised if they do, because we have spent considerable time on this issue. These are the first consumer protection regulations of this kind in the country. I think they provide a much needed framework for what has been an unregulated industry. And I hope and expect the companies to begin implementing them immediately. But they don 2019t have to, until January or later. Yes. Per our rule-making, there 2019s a comment period over the next couple months and a public hearing, and we will continue to take input from all stakeholders, including the companies. Then they will become effective early in the year, at the end of January or after that. I want to make sure we get it right. For more about fantasy sports, watch this Fortune video:  ",

   "input": "It was hard to disagree with the garrulous Russian on a night like this. Daley did indeed get the pop star treatment, receiving a rapturous welcome from a full house of 3,000 underneath the exotic ceiling of this dramatic arena, with the scene set for the schoolboy to sprinkle the sort of Olympic stardust which Jessica Ennis and Sir Chris Hoy had sprayed around in competition at the weekend. And after qualifying a little haphazardly in sixth place in the morning preliminaries, for a while during an absorbing final it was easy to believe Daley and his experienced 30-year-old partner might do just that as they lay in bronze medal position after four rounds, looking on course to emulate the women 2019s synchro pairing of Tonia Couch and Sarah Barrow 24 hours earlier. Then came 1 00bd seconds of calamity. Attempting their most ambitious and difficult dive, a forward four and half somersault, the pair fouled up spectacularly. Waterfield 2019s execution was poor but Daley 2019s was nightmarish, with the youngster barely having come out of the fourth somersault and was completely crooked as he hit the water. From third, they plummeted to 00adseventh. It could only be interpreted as a loss of nerve at the vital time. Daley shrugged afterwards that 201cit was just one dive that we missed and that 2019s what happens in a sport like diving. That was the difference between winning a medal and not. 201d Evangulov disagreed; he felt even without the dismal dive they would still only have been fourth at best. Daley, unaware of the latest barbs being aimed his way, afterwards defended his training regime and also noted the recent injuries suffered by both him and Waterfield, as he insisted: 201cI know that I 2019ve been putting in all of the hours I can. Unfortunately today wasn 2019t our day. 201d Waterfield, too, felt compelled to rush to his partner 2019s defence. 201cWe didn 2019t miss a dive because Tom has been doing too much media. We missed a dive because we 2019ve had setbacks with injuries. It 2019s you guys [the media] who are saying it 2019s all about the media. You keep bringing it up. 201d Except it was Evangulov who brought up the subject again here. It is actually easy to feel some sympathy for Daley because he has always handled himself, from his wunderkind days, with remarkable commitment and maturity. Indeed, Evangulov wanted to express what a fan of Daley he remained but made it clear that he felt he still wasn 2019t doing enough work. 201cOf course, the Mexicans [who finished second last night] train 12 times a week. Tom has increased his training from six to nine times a week, which is already a great achievement as he 2019s at school, but his rivals are professionals, they train as full-timers. As for the Chinese. Unbeatable. 201d This was not even China 2019s first-choice pairing but Yuan Cao and Yanquan Zhang were so dazzling, they did not even seem to cause the merest splash on entry, finishing 62 points clear of the Britons. But Evangulov wanted to end his address on a positive note. 201cApart from the Chinese, the rest we can compete with. I 2019ve said Tom is a genius and I believe in him and Pete. We can still win a medal. 201d 1 Yuan Cao & Yanquan Zhang (Chn) 481.29pts 2 Ivan Alejandro Garcia & German Sanchez (Mex) 460.17 3 Patrick Hausding & Sascha Klein (Ger) 457.41 4 David Boudia & Nick Mccrory (USA) 444.93 5 Jose A Guerra & Jeinkler Aguirre (Cub) 432.30 6 Ilya Zakharov & Victor Minibaev (Rus) 432.27 7 Thomas Daley & Peter Waterfield (Gbr) 419.97 8 Kevin Alan Geyson & Eric Sehn (Can) 402.12 9 Oleksandr Bondar & Oleksandr Gorshkovozov (Ukr) 380.16 10 Jiho Park & Yitaek Oh (Kor) 378.30  ",

It 2019s other phone manufacturers and wireless devices. This provides opportunities to buy at cheap valuations. 201d Some of the most compelling investment cases come from technologies that attack existing sources of profit and transform current business practices. Benefiting from these themes is arguably much easier than attempting to pick a winner from the periphery of the tech world, where there are countless companies vying for attention. 201cCloud computing 201d, where computing power is hosted by a service provider online rather than on a company 2019s own equipment, is one example. Mr Rogoff said: 201cYou used to have to spend capital on equipment and people, put that against a problem and see whether it stuck. Now you can put a business together quickly, break even more quickly and see whether the concept works. 201d He said cloud computing is now at the point where it is starting to profit at the expense of existing technologies, challenging established giants of the old order. One element that has changed significantly since the tech bubble is the scale of user bases and how quickly they can grow. The growth of Pokemon Go, the smartphone game, to tens of millions of daily users almost instantaneously is testament to that. But there remains the challenge of turning user numbers into money. Twitter is still struggling to convert its 300 million users into revenues, and media businesses face similar problems in making money from their online readership. Mr Train said: 201cFrom our perspective, the most interesting thing in technology is what attracts millions or billions of eyeballs to a given place. There is clearly extraordinary value in places that can aggregate so much attention.  ",

But if you feel a wave of gymnastics withdrawal coming over you, not to worry 2013 there's plenty more where those killer routines came from. Here, 10 need-to-see, pretty-much-perfect gymnastic routines that'll help to ease the post-Olympics void. It's only been four years since Maroney pulled this off, but it's still as impressive as the day she did it. Johnson became only the second American woman ever to win gold in the balance beam final in Beijing with this spot-on routine. When you do something so well they name it for you, that's how you know you killed it. Comaneci was only 14 years old when she nailed this routine, getting the highest-ever score in gymnastics. She won the gold this year, too, but Russian gymnast Mustafina's routine from 2012 proves she's been queen of this event for quite sometime now. Raisman took home one individual gold from London, for this routine. Liukin's stuck landing helped her to cinch the all-around gold medal in Beijing. Before she was the bars specialist of the Final Five, Kocian tied for gold at the World Championships. At her second World Championships, Biles proved she wasn't just a one-hit wonder, winning her second consecutive gold in this event. When Strug landed this, the U.S. all but cemented its first-ever team gold medal, and the team's place in history.

Airport officers reportedly tried to approach the man to calm him down, but he scaled the fence and ran into the construction area of the airport.

Shares of Abercrombie tumbled 20% to $18.29 on Tuesday. Sales at stores open at least a year are expected to 201cremain challenging 201d through the second half of the year, the company said. In May, the company expected 201cbetter results 201d in the back of the year following assortment changes and other investments. Executive Chairman Arthur Martinez cited 201ctraffic headwinds in the domestic mall business 201d and a 201csignificant drop-off 201d in tourism. 201cWe do not see those headwinds materially changing in the next few months, 201d he said in an interview.

Analysts had expected a 4.2% decline. The company 2019s Hollister brand, which has been a bright spot in past quarters, lost steam. Hollister sales at stores open at least a year fell 2%, while that metric fell 7% at Abercrombie.

Total revenue fell 4% to $783.2 million for the quarter. The company 2019s net loss was $13.1 million, or 19 cents a share, compared with $0.8 million, or 1 cent, a year ago. Analysts had expected a loss of 20 cents a share on $783 million of revenue, according to FactSet. The chain plans to close up to 60 stores in the U.S. and is evaluating other locations as about 50% of its U.S. leases expire by the end of fiscal 2017. The company has closed about a third of its U.S. locations over the past six years, leaving around 744 in its home market. 201cWe continue to have significant flexibility to strike the right channel balance, as we anticipate evolving shopping preferences, 201d said Finance Chief Joanne Crevoiserat. Mr. Martinez said the company is continuing to hold the line on promotions. 201cWe took our foot off the gas on discounting in the second quarter, 201d he said. 201cWe believe it is right for the brand. 201d One source of improvement was its digital performance. Direct-to-consumer sales grew to approximately 23% of total company sales for the second quarter, compared with 21% last year. Mr. Martinez attributed the increase to progress made on website design and omnichannel initiatives. The company also recently expanded its reach across the web by entering into a wholesale agreement with Zalando SE , an online fashion retailer based in Europe.

   "input": "Police divers have again scoured Perth's Swan River as the investigation continues into the murder of a wealthy, reclusive artist whose body was found inside a suitcase floating on the waterway. Annabelle Chen's body was found on July 2 but it took until September 5 to identify the 57-year-old after her Melbourne-based daughter reported her missing. Her daughter travelled to Perth from Melbourne because she was worried that she had not been able to contact her mother since she saw her in Perth on June 30, two days before her body was found. The divorcee had lived in the affluent suburb of Mosman Park since 1999 and was partly estranged from her large, extended family. Distinctive ceramic tiles that were found in the suitcase - presumably placed there in a bid to weigh it down - were reportedly also in the bathroom of a home she previously owned on Wellington Street. It's believed she sold the home several years ago, and the house has had different owners since then. There is no suggestion they knew Ms Chen. Police, who scoured Ms Chen's Meath Mews property for clues when they revealed her identity on last week, say she suffered significant injuries and it's hoped the dive on Wednesday will provide more information about the circumstances around her violent death. The divers are searching waters near the Fremantle Traffic Bridge where more of the distinctive tiles were previously found. A kick scooter with a breadboard strapped to it was also found in the same area and may have been used to move the suitcase. Police are seeking information from anyone who saw suspicious activity along the river from Thursday, June 30 to Saturday, July 2.  ",

   "input": "09 28 2016 AT 10:00 PM EDT says that her character, Zoey, goes through what most teenagers go through throughout season 3. On Wednesday night's premiere , the eldest daughter in the Johnson family opts out of praying for the family's dinner and reveals that she is questioning her faith. I don't know if I feel comfortable leading grace when I'm not sure if I believe in God , she states in the episode. I feel like Zoey is now at this place in her world in which after her parents basically telling her what to believe her entire life , she's now realizing that not everything goes as planned and she's wondering what that means, I guess, in terms of her belief. It's just not as simple as 'well, this is the truth, ' Shahidi ,16, exclusively tells PEOPLE. She continues, I think every person has gone through a period of time when they ask , 'Am I believing this just to be believe? Is this real? What is happening? There's so many bad things that happen in the world. Does that mean that there isn't a God?' Reflecting on her character's thought process , Shahidi says that Zoey is going through what most teenagers go through and that she voices her doubts with specific intention versus merely being a rebellious teen. Unlike other episodes in which you see her rebel for the sake of rebelling , she truly has a reason and she truly is trying to find an answer.

Then in a bizarre Bloods punishment , one of the women whipped the victim's back 31 times with a belt because the gang felt she didn't resist them enough , sources said. Their logic makes no sense , a police source said. They hold her down , then whip her for not fighting stronger against the rape. She did push and shove them , but not enough to the degree they thought was acceptable. Although other party guests several of whom were not Bloods members witnessed the half-hour attack , none tried to stop it, police sources said. About dawn, the woman ran from the house at 1299 Ocean Ave. and called police. She was treated and released from Coney Island Hospital. Investigators said the six suspects, all Brooklyn residents, admitted their Bloods allegiance in video-taped statements.

Little Selwin Adams Jr. plummeted nearly 30 feet to the concrete courtyard on Morris Ave., Fordham, shortly before 9 a.m., witnesses told police. The father [who lived alone] was making breakfast in the kitchen and [the boy] was playing in the living room , said Officer Eve Serrano , a police spokeswoman. The window had no guards and the child fell out the window. Startled neighbors , who later speculated that the windows in the apartment might have been open because of the excessive heat and humidity in the building, peered from their rear windows as Selwin's grief-stricken mother began to scream hysterically. I heard screaming , apparently from the [boy's] mother. The father came running down to get the baby, said Tony , the building superintendent. The baby was alive. His eyes were open , but he looked like he was in pain, the superintendent added. He was groaning and he couldn't talk this breaks my heart. I have kids , too. The boy's father , Selwin Adams Sr., quickly scooped up his son and jumped into a passing livery cab. The cab rushed to nearby Union Hospital, where doctors worked for nearly four hours to stabilize the badly injured child. Before the child could be transported to Montefiore Medical Center's pediatric emergency department, he died about 12:45 p.m. Meanwhile, the residential building's management company yesterday said there were no window guards in the Adams apartment because no children lived there. There are no children in that apartment , said building manager Isadore Fishman. The mother and child were not the tenants of the apartment. According to building residents , there was a plumbing leak in Adams' apartment. His son and the boy's mother had come to housesit while the repairs were under way, presumably while Adams was at work, one neighbor said. City regulations require landlords and managing agents to properly install window guards to protect children under the age of 11. In addition, tenants can request window guards whether or not there are children in the household.  ",

   "input": "A year that began with a bang was interrupted by a , and now is ending with a whimper. Next year is projected to be better 2014 but not for everybody. The March earthquake and tsunami in , which put a months-long halt to automobile production, combined with a moribund job market and a steady drumbeat of bad economic news to slam the brakes on television advertising sales. Early in 2011, economists predicted that TV advertising revenue in the U.S. would increase 6% this year to an all-time high. But during the summer the TV ad market cooled considerably, with the pace of growth slowing to less than 2% for the year. TV ad revenue is expected to end the year at nearly $68 billion 2014 still a record, but the slowdown is a reminder of TV advertising's vulnerability. The ad market has been slowly drifting downward over the course of the year , said Jon Swallen , senior vice president of research at Kantar Media, which monitors advertising spending. Traditional media sectors are lagging , experiencing softness, which suggests broad-based caution on the part of advertisers. Seismic shifts in spending continue to roil the media industry. Those changes come on top of the recession , which prompted advertisers to reduce spending. Some of the biggest ad buyers 2014 retailers, automakers, car dealerships and home sellers 2014 have been particularly hard hit, and few are predicting a speedy economic recovery. Overall ad spending in the U.S. is expected to grow a meager 1.8% this year to $144 billion, Swallen said. MagnaGlobal recently cut its 2012 forecast to 2.9% growth in total ad spending, down from the nearly 5% that the agency was predicting just a few months ago. During the first quarter of 2011, media companies that owned TV networks and prominent cable channels were riding high and assuming the recession was in the rearview mirror. Advertisers were paying 25% premiums over last year's rates to buy commercial spots that were still available. TV network chiefs figured they would reap double-digit rate increases for their commercial time when the annual television ad sales season revved up in June. The networks sell nearly 80% of their commercial time for the coming season during the upfront TV advertising market. But those heady days came to an end in March when a magnitude 9 earthquake and devastating tsunami hit Japan. The quake damaged car factories , slowing production of major models from Supply lines also were interrupted, leading to a shortage of parts. With fewer cars to ship to the lots, Japanese companies slashed their ad purchases. There was a slowdown in car sales and so other automakers did not advertise as aggressively , Kantar's Swallen said. They figured they didn't need to advertise as much to meet their sales quotas. By late summer , the Japanese car inventory had returned, and auto companies were kicking into gear their big-budget marketing plans. Then came devastating floods in Now , those floods are threatening to severely curtail production from Japanese automakers because they source a lot of their parts from Thailand, Swallen said. The sluggish economy also continues to take its toll. Spooked by the weak job market , stagnant wages and falling home values, consumers have not been spending as freely. Retailers, in particular, have been feeling the pinch. Hollywood movie studios, traditionally heavy spenders, have been cutting back too 2014 but for a different reason. Major studios have been releasing fewer big-budget films in recent years, so they haven't needed to spend as much on marketing. 's studio, for example, is releasing 14 films this year, down from 19 released in 2000 and 32 released in 1995, according to box-office tracker Hollywood.com. It's a very complex market , said Lisa Herdman , director of national programming at RPA, a Santa Monica ad agency. There is not one thing that is driving it , but it seems that the root of all of this can be tied back to the consumer confidence level. Wall Street analysts have been monitoring the performance of Disney , and other large media companies, searching for worrisome trends. Lower ratings for TV programs have become a concern, said Doug Creutz, media analyst at Cowen & Co. Although networks are commanding higher rates for their commercial time compared with last year, ad revenue is shaping up to be flat or down because programs are drawing smaller audiences. For the first seven weeks of the TV season, is averaging 7.3 million viewers a night 2014 down 9% compared with a year earlier. Several new NBC shows have bombed, and once-trusty veterans, including Law & Order: and The Biggest Loser , have bled more than 1 million viewers. Without football , NBC's ratings would be approaching basic cable channel levels, Creutz said. David Campanelli , senior vice president of national broadcast for ad-buyer Horizon Media Inc., said, CBS is in the strongest position of the broadcast networks based on their current prime-time ratings performance. And sports programming has been strong and reliable. Sports have become a safe haven for advertisers. CBS is averaging 13 million viewers a night , up 2% compared with the first seven weeks of last season. Disney's is fetching 9.66 million viewers in prime time, down 1%. Broadcasting, helped by a World Series that stretched seven games, boasts an average of 10 million viewers a night, a 22% increase over the same period last year. However, the network over-estimated the size of the audience for two of its big bets, the singing competition and the sci-fi family drama Because those shows have delivered lower ratings than promised, Fox now must compensate advertisers by giving them additional commercial time 2014 spots the network could otherwise have sold. For some media companies, hope is on the horizon. Next year will bring a bounty of political advertising dollars as candidates and interest groups spend as much as $2.4 billion to promote themselves and their causes. We think 2012 will be the biggest year ever for political advertising , said Vincent Letang , director of global forecasting for MagnaGlobal, an arm of advertising behemoth in London should also generate at least $600 million in ad spending, Letang said. The concurrence of the and political contests 2014 including a presidential election that could generate as much as $1 billion in spending 2014 combine to create the quadrennial effect , which occurs every four years. Still , that $3-billion bonanza will not be spread evenly over all media sectors, nor will it help those suffering the most. , which has the TV rights to the , will rake in the Olympics money. The bulk of the political campaign cash will flow to media companies that own TV stations 2014 especially those in battleground states such as Nevada, Colorado, Ohio and Florida. Newspapers, magazines and other print media, which have been under assault as advertising dollars migrate to the Internet, will be relegated to the sidelines. A key question heading into 2012 is whether political candidates will follow the broader advertising trend by scaling back local TV commercial purchases to put a larger chunk of their money on the Internet. Overall, Creutz said, the U.S. advertising market for 2011 is still below 2007 levels, when spending hit $149 billion. Since that time, he said, Internet advertising has soared, but the amount spent on local media 2014 including TV stations, radio, newspaper and direct mail 2014 has decreased by a much greater margin. Local media has been crushed , Creutz said. The Internet is replacing local media , but it is not replacing it dollar-for-dollar.  ",

   "input": "And the read option putteth away. A week after a read-option call went horribly awry in an overtime loss to the Rams, the 49ers used a tamer version of the play to seal a 27-13 win over the Dolphins on Sunday at Candlestick Park. Clinging to a seven-point lead with less than three minutes left, quarterback Colin Kaepernick took a shotgun snap from the pistol formation, faked a handoff to running back Frank Gore and dashed, untouched, 50 yards around left end for a that-will-do-it touchdown. The previous Sunday, Kaepernick's airmailed read-option pitch resulted in a St. Louis touchdown and a barrage of criticism for offensive coordinator Greg Roman. That mistake hardly deterred San Francisco on Sunday. With the game in the balance, Roman called a series of read options. It was a totally different play , but a similar concept, left tackle Joe Staley said. We actually ran that play three times in a row. The final one , we stuck with it, we got the right look. We got what we needed, and Kaep took it to the house. Asked about the play , head coach Jim Harbaugh began by praising his scrutinized assistant: Yeah , he said , great call by Greg. Kaepernick's dash provided a bit of flash , but the grind-it-out victory had all the elements of a San Francisco win circa 2011 under the direction of supplanted quarterback Alex Smith. The defense limited to Miami to 227 yards, special-teams ace C.J. Spillman recovered a muffed punt that led to a 9-yard touchdown drive , and Kaepernick was coolly efficient. In his fourth career start , he completed 78 percent of his passes (18-for-23) for 185 yards with no touchdowns and no interceptions. He was sacked four times and completed only one pass of more than 20 yards. So does this: I thought he managed the game well , Harbaugh said. With the 49ers leading 13-6 late in the third quarter , it was actually Gore who highlighted their most impressive drive, a 13-play, 83-yard march capped by Anthony Dixon's 1-yard run with 14:30 left in the game. Dixon's plunge was preceded by Gore's 19-yard run up the middle on the first play of the fourth quarter. Earlier in the drive, on 2nd-and-20 at San Francisco's 43, Gore caught a short pass in the left flat and began zig-zagging through defenders en route to a 19-yard gain that featured five broken tackles. After he was finally brought down, several 49ers were jumping exuberantly on the sideline and right guard Alex Boone was apologizing for being the man to finally flatten Gore. After the game, Gore, smiling, said Boone also put him on the ground against the Seahawks and Vikings. Frank can break any tackle , Staley said , but he can't break a tackle by Boone. Cracked Boone: Better I hit him than someone else. The levity was short-lived , however. Trailing 20-6, the Dolphins responded with a 75-yard drive capped by rookie quarterback Ryan Tannehill's 3-yard pass to tight end Anthony Fasano on 4th-and-goal with 7:55 left. After a San Francisco three-and-out, the Dolphins regained possession and quickly had a first down at the 49ers' 35-yard line. Against a 5-7 team, memories of the 16-13 overtime loss in St. Louis were unearthed for the 49ers. It doesn't matter who we play , safety Donte Whitner said. We're getting everybody's best effort each and every Sunday , and they use us to measure themselves. St. Louis did the same thing. On Sunday , though, the defense stiffened with Miami driving for the potential game-tying score. Tannehill threw four straight incompletions from San Francisco's 35. The 49ers gained possession on downs, and moments later came Kaepernick's game-sealing touchdown, which began with a fake to Gore. Kaep made a big play , Gore said. He read it real good. Everyone came to me , and Mr. Everything did his thing. Actually , on Sunday, Kaepernick didn't do it all, but he did enough to win. Colin Kaepernick's 50-yard touchdown run sealed the 49ers' 27-13 win over Miami on Sunday. It was his fifth running TD of the season.

   "input": "Two years ago, Kara Walker came across a news story in an edition of the 19th-century Atlanta newspaper the Daily Constitution. The year was 1878; the piece described, in excruciating detail, the recent lynching of a black woman. The mob had tugged down the branch of a blackjack tree, tied the woman's neck to it, and then released the branch, flinging her body high into the air. This terrible fragment of the past has made its way into a large graphite drawing, now hanging inside the Camden Arts Centre, London, where Walker is about to have her first major UK solo show. Like much of her work, the drawing is both beautiful and disturbing: here, in grotesque, cartoonish monochrome, is the blackjack tree, the lynched woman spilling blood, her assailants laughing as she dies. As I stand and stare, Walker tells me why she was so drawn to the story. It's this completely absurd , extreme, violent situation that required so much perverse ingenuity. Her London show is not large 2013 just three rooms , with 11 recent works 2013 but it is significant and overdue. Walker is one of the most uncompromising contemporary American artists, not just for the quality of her work 2013 which comprises drawing, film, and her signature medium, silhouettes 2013 but for the fact that her art engages with what many would rather forget: the appalling violence meted out to the black population before and after the American civil war and the abolition of slavery, and the legacy of racism that still shapes the US political agenda. Another drawing, Urban Relocator, shows a hooded, Klan-like figure next to a bare cotton tree: this is, Walker says, partly inspired by the boll weevil cotton plague that 2013 along with the violence many freed slaves endured 2013 led many black families, including Walker's, to abandon their land in the south for a better life in the northern states. My own family were once given a piece of land , she says. I started thinking about what happened to that land; about what made so many people leave the south , whether it was social violence, or domestic terrorism, or economic strife. Walker is at her most provocative when interrogating the stereotyping that defined race relations in the antebellum south , and still exists today. The largest room in her show is lined with wall samplers: the cut-out silhouettes that show figures engaged in violent or exaggerated acts: a man bending down to fellate an oversized phallus; a woman in a wide-skirted dress holding a severed head. The effect is to make us question not only the cultural representations of black people (there is , as Walker points out, a whiff of minstrels and blackface about some of the figures) but also our assumptions about how skin colour defines anyone's physical characteristics and behaviour. Walker has exhibited widely in the US , and at 27 (she's now 43) became the youngest person ever to receive the prestigious MacArthur Foundation's genius grant scholarship. But she has also caused controversy. Exhibitions of her work often provoke strong feelings: staff at a library in Newark , New Jersey, recently reacted with outrage when one of her drawings was displayed there, prompting the head librarian to cover it up. And back when she received the MacArthur grant, she was lambasted by several older African-American artists, including Betye Saar and Howardena Pindell. There were two strains of criticism , Walker says. One was about the work , and who was looking at it, and me feeding into the viewing audience's preconceived ideas about black people. And the other was that I was just some highfalutin so-and-so. Her father , the artist Larry Walker, published a letter in her defence. It was under his tutelage that she had first decided to become an artist: she started drawing and painting when she was three. She says neither of her parents has ever felt completely comfortable with her work 2013 her mother walked out of a screening of Fall Frum Grace, Miss Pipi's Blue Tale, a sexually explicit shadow-puppet film that features in the London show 2013 but her father argued that his generation of black artists had fought to give future generations the right to make art of any sort. He was saying , basically, that I should be able to do whatever the hell I want. I think that's what I'm always battling against with my work 2013 part of me wants to resist the pull to be doing what's expected of me as a black artist. It was while studying art as an undergraduate in Atlanta that Walker first felt this pull: an expectation , from her professors and fellow students alike, that as a black artist she should be striving to represent the black experience positively. I was making big paintings , with mythological themes. When I started painting black figures, the white professors were relieved, and the black students were like, 'She's on our side'. These are the kinds of issues that a white male artist just doesn't have to deal with. A key moment came when Walker discovered Adrian Piper , the conceptual artist and philosopher who, in the 1970s, made a series of performance works featuring herself as an androgynous, racially indeterminate young man. It was the first voice that resonated with me , in talking about race with objectivity and sternness, she says. Until then , I only knew 'black art' in the romantic sense 2013 that it was only about positive representations of African American life. Walker began to think about what she really wanted to say. She was born in Stockton , California, and moved to an Atlanta suburb at the age of 13, when her father took a job there. After liberal California, the racial tensions of the south came as a shock. I just didn't get the rules , she says. I didn't know what the story was that made people behave in very particular ways that I thought were prescripted and unnatural. I started looking for my own point of origin: maybe the point of origin was being American , or being black, or being a woman. I thought, 'I'll start with the foundation of this idea of a place, of America, and then work my way forward.' Walker sees a direct line between the racist historical attitudes she examines in her work and current events. She took a road trip last year with her daughter from Brooklyn , where she lives, to the southern states. They visited diners where the heads of old white men turned to give them the 20-second stare. They swam in a motel pool , watching the other (white) bathers suddenly vanish; Walker heard a small girl say to her father: I thought there were no niggers here. Then there is the rise of the Tea Party movement , and the distasteful obsession with Barack Obama's skin colour. There's so much suspicion around having a biracial president , she says , around Obama's presence on the world stage 2013 the fact that the Tea Party gets coverage as anything other than a fringe group. There's nothing Obama can say or do as a black man that they're [willing] to hear. Walker is by now used to viewers being discomfited not only by the fact that her work dares to speak openly about race and identity , but that it may even be making fun of such viewers. It makes people queasy , she says. And I like that queasy feeling.  ",

   "input": "After unveiling the design for a new $700 million glass tower that will replace 7 World Trade Center, developer Larry Silverstein confessed there's one small hitch. He has no tenants. But Silverstein - who controlled 7 WTC as well as the twin towers - insisted he isn't worried about finding companies to fill the building. Three years is too much of a lead time , he said , referring to the projected 2005 completion date. We have a few years to go before he must begin looking for tenants. Under normal circumstances , New York developers try to lease about half of a new office tower before beginning construction. But yesterday was far from ordinary. Public officials like Mayor Bloomberg and Gov. Pataki flocked to the site just north of Ground Zero and spoke of the new 7 WTC as a symbol of the rebuilding effort more than a reflection of current demand for office space, which is low. For those that say we aren't going fast enough , just take a look at the digging here, said Bloomberg , standing just north of the pit at Ground Zero. The original 7 World Trade Center collapsed on Sept. 11,2001, nearly eight hours after burning debris from the twin towers rained on it. No one inside 7 WTC died. The new building, designed by architect David Childs of Skidmore Owings and Merrill, will be taller and narrower than the original so Greenwich Street can be reopened. At a sacrifice of 300,000 rentable square feet from the old design, Childs called this concession a gift back to the city from Silverstein. The new building's site is bounded by Barclay , Greenwich, Vesey and Washington streets. The former building reached as far east as West Broadway, blocking Greenwich Street. The new building will feature twice the required fireproofing on its steel frame and reinforced concrete walls around its structural core. Its stairways also will be 20% wider than required - to allow for a more rapid evacuation. Like its forerunner, it will house a Con Edison substation in its base. The substation will take up the first 10 stories, and a new park will sit across Greenwich Street. Foundation work already has started on the 1. 6 million-square-foot tower. This building , 7 World Trade Center, is an important symbol. But more than that, it's a concrete step, Pataki said. Silverstein's $800 million insurance policy on 7 WTC will cover most of the construction costs , the developer said. If more financing is needed, he will use tax-exempt Liberty Bonds. Silverstein and a group of insurers are battling in court over his coverage for the twin towers. He will receive between $3. 7 billion, which he has vowed to use to rebuild about 10 million square feet of office space. The Port Authority could become the lead tenant of the new 7 WTC, though the agency and Silverstein have not reached an agreement, sources said. The PA had its headquarters in the twin towers, leasing about 800,000 square feet there. The agency has short-term offices near Union Square, but still needs a permanent home.

   "input": "FRAMINGHAM 2014 Many people plugged into the Boston cultural world in the last 50 or 60 years will want to see 201cBarbara Swan: Reflected Self 201d at Danforth Art because Swan, a portraitist, painted family and friends. It 2019s like a reunion. There 2019s poet Anne Sexton! Luise Vosgerchian, beloved professor of music at Harvard! Painter Bernard Chaet! And there, as babies, are Swan 2019s children 2014 Aaron Fink, now a successful painter himself, and Joanna Fink, director of Alpha Gallery, depicted with an intimacy and directness that seems loving yet pragmatic. Swan, who died in 2003 at 80, deserves examination. In the 1940s, she studied at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts with Karl Zerbe. The Museum School then was a hotbed of Boston Expressionism, a style known for its brilliant, brushy colors, its attention to matters of spirit and psyche, and its adherence to figuration even as abstraction swept the art world. Because of her academic origins, early paint handling, concern with the figure, and tart color sense, we might categorize Swan as a Boston Expressionist. But her early work, from the 1950s, is less tortured, less concerned with the upheavals of life, than that of proponents of the style such as Zerbe and Jack Levine. As a portraitist, Swan focused on her subjects rather than her own neuroses or spiritual dilemmas. That came later. The show, organized by Danforth Art 2019s assistant curator, Jessica Roscio, follows certain through-lines in Swan 2019s career, notably the concerns and negotiations of being a woman artist in the mid to late 20th century. Roscio suggests that feminine and domestic themes, though not discussed, were more accepted by the Boston Expressionists than by the generally more machismo Abstract Expressionists. But the show hinges on the incisive portraits; Swan conveys a great deal with very few, graceful lines. There 2019s a particularly telling early pair of the artist and her mother, on pages that faced each other in her sketchbook: 201cPortrait of the Artist 2019s Mother (Clara Swan) 201d depicts a stern, solid older woman, arms crossed and head tilted. Her eyes penetrate. A smile 2014 of satisfaction or triumph 2014 begins to play on her lips. In her self-portrait, Swan 2019s shoulders slump, her eyes are weary. She looks defeated in her mother 2019s gaze. Swan always began with the eyes 2014 so her husband, Alan (Alpha Gallery 2019s president), told Roscio. You can see it in many portraits. The eyes anchor all else. Before feminists theorized about the gaze, Swan was already turning it back on the viewer through the astute eyes of the women she drew. Those who don 2019t directly appraise us turn inward 2014 you can see it in a drawing, inventively composed from above, of artist Lois Tarlow. In the painted portraits, Swan sometimes works too hard, as if she hasn 2019t found her element. Even vibrant colors feel muddy; forms, especially bodies, lack the crisp energy seen in her drawings. But then we get to those baby pictures. In the drawing 201cJoanna and Aaron, 201d the exactness of detail eschews sentimentality. The painting 201cBaby (Aaron at 4 Months) 201d has the infant riding in his father 2019s upraised hand, eyes wide with that strange combination of alertness and total unknowing that characterizes a baby 2019s gaze. His skin is all reds and gray-blues, and the background like burnished copper. The painting glows and coheres. Barbara Swan 2019s 201cThe Nest 2019 2019 at Danforth Art. There 2019s also a terrific overhead depiction of a babe nursing at his mother 2019s breast in 201cThe Nest, 201d in both a sketch and a painting. Here the painting outdoes the drawing, as Swan jiggers the composition and repositions the mother 2019s hand. Over time, Swan 2019s paintings grew less brushy, less expressionistic 2014 but more succinct in execution, like her drawings. She took to working on still lifes. These, Roscio suggests, were a kind of self-portrait, in their investigation of the feminine and their use of objects that held intimate meaning for the artist. They 2019re also examinations of perception, as images reflect in and refract through glass bottles. Those objects 2014 art historical reproductions, images from pop culture, dolls 2014 represent ways women have been depicted through time. The bottles bend and fracture these symbols of femininity. In 201cA Doll Named Keturah, 201d Swan positions a treasured, Victorian-era doll and three bottles before a print of Edvard Munch 2019s 201cGirls on the Bridge. 201d We see one girl 2019s disaffected face, and the hallucinatory swirl of water and shore beyond. The doll looks stiff and overwhelmed, cloaked in black. Leaning against a bottle, she fractures and she doubles. She 2019s riveting, and yet somehow a throwaway, at the edge of the painting. In the background, a hand holds a paintbrush to a canvas 2014 as if the artist is looking in a mirror, painting a self-portrait. If so, she 2019s putting her inner life to paint, revisiting a strain of Boston Expressionism, and revealing some of her own twists, cracks, and vulnerabilities. Swan painted 201cA Doll Named Keturah 201d in 1981. In the manner in which it unpacks images of femininity, it 2019s a relic of its era. Still, there are enough uncertainties in it 2014 particularly in the haunted face and posture of that doll 2014 that it 2019s no pat feminist palaver. It says something about the artist, and her understanding of art and herself. Looking at these things, she finds a hall of mirrors. And that, today, continues to compel.  ",

   "input": "Detail from Henri Matisse: The Sheaf. Click to enlarge. Photograph: Henri Matisse DACS 2014 I have vivid memories of the Matisse retrospective show that opened the Hayward Gallery in 1968. I had mostly seen only reproductions of the great paintings and cutouts, and it was astonishing, to discover what a brilliant colourist and draughtsman he was. I went to the Vence chapel in Provence in the mid 201170s and was similarly bowled over, as everyone is. Shortly afterwards I saw the catalogue for an American show of the cutouts that made me want to do a cutout show one day. Sometimes these ideas can sit at the back of your mind for a surprisingly long time and now, nearly 40 years later, we're doing it. Colour was always fundamental to Matisse, but the originality of taking these sheets of coloured paper, using an almost childlike process of juxtaposition of flat surfaces to create schematic images, was really unprecedented in art. But while the cutouts are the great late flowering of his work, it did take quite a while for them to be appreciated. They were shown in the Salon de Paris in the early 50s and were largely dismissed as the wanderings of an old man. The first significant show, of a very limited number of pieces, was at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1961, seven years after his death. The Tate bought The Snail in 1962, which at the time was a very bold move because there would have been plenty of people arguing that they should use the money to buy a classic painting from the 1930s. The Snail has been a cornerstone for the Tate ever since, but, in general, we didn't buy often enough or early enough. Normally, if you want to see Matisse you have to go to Paris or New York, but this show will be by far the most extensive and important exhibition of the cutouts since his death. All the important works will be there and will reveal the evolution of his ambition. He started using the cutouts as a way of making books and illustrations, and then they became independent works in their own right. He saw a potential in them that no one else had ever seen. And because he was by this time infirm, it gave him an opportunity to work on a much grander scale than he could as a painter. Suddenly they begin to occupy a wall and become almost environmental in scale. It was through this work that Matisse realised his only great architectural, quasi-public and, in this case, religious commission: the chapel in Vence. He had always wanted to do a big decorative scheme, as is the tradition of painters in France, and he used the cutout as the means by which to achieve his ambition. It has to be one of the great works made anywhere at any time. The Sistine ceiling or the Vence chapel? I wouldn't want to choose between them. It is not by chance that there hasn't been a substantial cutouts show for nearly 40 years. Our initial task as curators was persuading the owners of these relatively fragile works to allow them to travel and to part with them for many months. Technological progress has made the process of moving works of art round the world very much more secure than it once was, but you ultimately persuade people to lend by convincing them that the show itself is going to be sufficiently well done, and that by bringing these works together we will gain an understanding of Matisse's methods, and an appreciation of the beauty of the works themselves, that you simply couldn't get by going from museum to museum. And that is what you will get. Matisse was working ahead of his time for most of his career and these late cutouts established a new language that artists have been working hard to digest ever since. They come close to work that might be made by a child in their sense of freshness and freedom, yet they are also very, very carefully composed and are works of art based on enormous restraint and experience of how colours fit together. A curator doesn't often say once in a lifetime , but I don't think we'll ever again be able to assemble a cutouts show with such quantity and quality. 2022 Nicholas Serota is director of the Tate art museums and co-curator of the exhibition.

   "input": "The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and Clarifications column, Saturday September 20 2003 In the article below, we said that Jonathan Miller's production of Der Rosenkavalier was revived at Covent Garden this spring, when it was, in fact, staged by ENO at the Coliseum between February 28 and April 6. I love getting stripped to my waist , says Jonathan Miller. I love putting on a visor and letting the sparks fly with a great big welding torch. Then going off for a big rough breakfast with a handyman. It's undeniably a macho thing. Is it hard to weld? No. The guy who taught me said: 'If you can light a cigarette without setting yourself on fire , you can weld.' I, says Miller , with a touch of pride, can weld. Of all Miller's incarnations - satirical young Turk in Beyond the Fringe , critically panned theatre director, critically panned opera director, endlessly revived opera director, critically re-evaluated theatre director, unwilling though knighted national treasure, winning defender of anglophone analytical philosophy, writer, doctor, photographer, painter, TV presenter and director, bloke who rolls his eyes when called a polymath and shakes his head when called a renaissance man - this latest, the rugged 69-year-old welder getting sunburned for his art, is the most unlikely. And yet, when he's got the afternoon off from directing operas in Santa Fe or putting Christopher Plummer through his paces as King Lear in Ontario, this is precisely where Jonathan Miller's creative juices have been flowing for the past four years. He'll nip off to a scrapyard, return with a rusting haul of intriguing bits of metal, and then spend hours welding RSJs to other bits until the results please him. And soon, with a bit of luck, they will be pleasing other people: because they are to go on show in London. That's a possibility , says Miller. Though the greater possibility is that I'll get a mauling from the press. As usual. Miller learned to weld while staying at the adobe Californian desert home of art dealers Claire and Eugene Thaw , a place fringed with sage brush and mesquite. It was these friends' handyman, Jim Johnson, who taught Miller to weld. It has become an unlikely passion. He's not yet read Don DeLillo's novel, Underworld, with its storyline about an artist in the desert respraying rusting old B-52 aircraft as a post-cold war conceptual-art project, though when I tell him about it he looks eager enough to head off to the American desert with a spray can. That said, such an artistic project would would be too freighted with clunking symbolism for Miller's taste. His art, and that is what he calls it, is formalist, eschewing any overt symbolism. I get a satisfaction from the formal play of shapes in all the visual art I've done , be it photographs, collages or sculpture or arranging objets trouv 00e9s at home, he explains. He has had these rusting assemblages shipped back to his north London home , prior to having them exhibited in St John's Wood. As Miller stands in the impromptu sculpture park that is his front garden, he is surrounded by the fruits of his welding. There's a lovely cataclysm of panel beating gone wrong in the long grass, a seeming carburettor with twiddly bits on the other side of the path, and a plaque of artfully arranged metal pieces hanging in the porch. They are all rather beautiful. Do they have names? This one's called Next One. And so's this. No , they don't have names. Only a philistine would take these rusting lumps of metal for discarded car parts abandoned by some sociopath and phone the council. But there aren't many philistines round here. His old Beyond the Fringe chum Alan Bennett, who lives opposite, probably casts an appreciative eye over them during his strolls. Critically mauled Martin Amis may dream of hefting them at the man from the TLS. It's not hard to imagine neighbours Michael Frayn and Claire Tomalin leaning over the wall and debating which piece bears the greater resemblance to Russian constructivist Kasimir Malevich's collages and which to English sculptor Anthony Caro's butch girder sculptures. I know your face , says a passing lady to whom Miller has given directions to Primrose Hill. That's nice , he says , looking away and returning to the sculptures. Is his artistic quest for some kind of significant form? I don't really hold with that Roger Fry bollocks , he says , not unpleasantly. But does he have some sort of goal when he puts these things together? How does he know when he's finished? Quite simply when the results please me , and it would be hard to say when that happens. But he's a formalist artist. Oh yes , I have a modernist sensibility in this. As he talks , we walk into the house, the same graceful Victorian pile near Regent's Park that he bought in the early 60s for 00a38,0, with a mortgage offered on the basis of reviews he had received for Beyond the Fringe. There are more rusting assemblages in the hall. Someone's going to bruise themselves a treat in that hall before long. Bubble-wrapped, framed collages, also destined for exhibition, are propped up all over the place. Lining the stairs are framed architectural drawings, including one done for Napoleon, that Miller claims are influential on his current work. They're all unconscious influences , of course - as are Morandi, Schwitters, Italian futurists, the Russian constructivists, and lots of others artists I admire. Isn't that Freudian? Oh no , it's the opposite of Freud, says Miller imperiously as he rounds the landing on the way to his studio. These influences aren't repressed; rather , there isn't enough space on my hard drive to keep all the influences there, so I forget them. I've just been reading a biography of Coleridge, how the poet forgot what he had read but how these influences cropped up in Kubla Khan and The Ancient Mariner. But the writer found Coleridge's library records so that he could reconstruct these influences even though Coleridge had forgotten. Something similar happens with Miller's work , and he loves reflecting on that role of forgetting in creation. He works on sculptures or collages with no thought as to which progenitors are influencing him, and then, when they're finished, he will see how they are influenced by his favourite artists or architectural draughtsmen. There's a box of bottles in his study, for instance, which Miller only realised owed a debt to Giorgio Morandi's etchings when it was done. It's a 3D Morandi , I now see. I didn't know that while I was making it. Most of the stuff Miller uses in his art is rubbish. He shows me a 40-year-old boxed assemblage featuring corks and a scrubbing brush without bristles. Four years ago , he produced a book of his photographs - ripped posters, stained walls, appealingly draped tarpaulins. He wanted to call it Absolute Rubbish. The publishers wouldn't let him, so he called it Nowhere in Particular instead. I'm interested in the overlooked and the negligible. That's where some of the most interesting breakthroughs in art and science come from. Until Freud , nobody thought about the significance of slips of the tongue. And now we think: how stupid not to have thought of that before. I make no grand claims for my work, but it seems to me to come from a similar noticing of the negligible. For 40 years I've been taking photographs with a cheap automatic camera , often of ripped-up posters. Sometimes, I whip out a Stanley knife and cut up posters from walls to make collages from later. I'll put them in plastic bags and hope I don't get too closely questioned at customs. I'm Jack the Stripper. One day , I was in Florence trimming a poster, and policeman came up to me: 'Che fai?' [What are you up to?] he asked. 'E arte!' [It's art] I replied, and he nodded and wandered off. I've always loved fragmented typography. The police round here probably wouldn't have deferred to such an artistic project so readily. Probably not. Sadly , Miller's appropriations of the negligible, his resuscitations of the abandoned and his recycling of decaying rubbish have so far been neglected. The book Nowhere in Particular fell stillborn from the press. Nobody was interested , he says. His exhibitions of collages in 1991 was scarcely reviewed. What will be the critical fate of his looming exhibition? I suspect Brian Sewell [the London Evening Standard's art critic] is hardly likely to go to such a remote place as St John's Wood. I don't have any great hopes of being reviewed for this. But then I do tend to get mauled in the press. I've said it many times that when I first directed operas I was regarded as a vandal , and now I'm seen as a fossil. Miller now complains that he finds it hard to get work in British theatre or opera. I got knighted last year , which was a mixed blessing. It was 'Take this and shut up'. I can't get work from the RSC, the National or ENO. Yet when my productions are revived - my Mikado is in its 18th year and is very popular - they get reviewed as classics. And there is some justice to his complaint: when , for instance, his production of Der Rosenkavalier was revived at Covent Garden in the spring, this originally derided production got a five-star review in the Guardian and was elsewhere hailed for being suggestively set at the time of its writing - just on the lip of the abyss of the first world war. Is his metalwork a replacement for the theatre and operas he should have been directing here? No , it's not that simple. And in any case I get work elsewhere. I'm off to Florence next week, after I've finished work on a TV series about atheism, to direct a revival of my production of Figaro. Later I'm directing Lear at the Lincoln Centre in New York. The metalwork is just something new for me, another interest. I am always filled with enthusiasms for new projects, like a little boy being asked to come out to play. It's hard to say no or not to yield to new projects. In Miller's kitchen , there are some prints by his son Tom, a photographer, that seem to share the same formalist predilections as those of his father. What does Tom say about his work? Miller shrugs in imitation of Tom's response: 'S'all right , I suppose.' But, he adds fondly , what is a son to say about his father's work? Good question. Miller is enthusiastic about his own father's art , some of which is displayed in another room. His dad was the founder of child psychiatry in Britain, and also produced likenesses of some of his patients. There's a red chalk drawing from 1921 of a patient undergoing hypnosis, and a bust of another patient who suffered wartime trauma. When I get called an intellectual or a renaissance man or a polymath I think about how my parents would have been embarrassed to be called such vulgar things. they were middle-class , cultivated people - my mother was a very good novelist - to whom knowing about books and art and speaking languages was normal, as well as taking an interest in science and philosophy. They were just educated people who had a lot of interests. It's normal. And so it is for me. I'm just normally sophisticated, like my dear old dad and my long-dead mother, but I'm increasingly ashamed of the vulgarity around me. 00b7 Jonathan Miller's metal constructions and paper collages go on show at the Boundary Gallery , 98 Boundary Road, London NW8 on September 26.

   "input": "Jean-Antoine Watteau's painting The Pilgrimage to Cythera (1717) is the most voluptuous paradise in European art. It hangs in the Louvre, and transports you from the Right Bank to a tropic of love. A crowd of people, perfumed and primped up, worship Venus; pink cupids float in the ether. But what makes this utopia so utopian is the landscape, barely touched into existence. A ripe, Rubensian foreground, a melting Leonardo-esque background, misty water - Watteau's painted world is a dream just on the point of fading to oblivion. It is the tenuousness of Watteau's vision, its exquisite painterly tension of fulfilment and loss, that holds us. Nothing is certain in this painting - it is both elegy and idyll. It may depict arrival or departure from the island; evening or dawn; or, to borrow the title of Hogarth's far less ethereal 18th-century portrayal of sex, Before or After. Watteau's rococo fantasia dwells on a myth that has snared western artists for centuries: the island of love. Venus, or Aphrodite, lived on the isle of Cythera, or perhaps it was Cyprus. In the 15th century, Botticelli painted her arriving there in the work known as The Birth of Venus, floating over the green sea on a scallop shell, the air heady with pink blossoms, the sea warmly sensual, the island wooded and green. Leonardo da Vinci imagined the island of love more disturbingly. It was a place where ships were shattered as sailors feasted their eyes on the beauty of Venus. Many there have been who , impelled by her loveliness, have had their ships and rigging broken upon the rocks which lie amidst the seething waves. They have good reason to be obsessed with this landscape of sensual delight: Here the beauty of some pleasant hill invites the wandering mariners to take their ease among its flowery verdure , where the zephyrs continually come and go, filling with sweet odours the island and the encompassing sea. Alas! How many ships have foundered there! Watteau synthesises and restates the myth of Cythera in his great history painting. He expresses the conjunction of landscape and desire perfectly in the yielding softness of his painted space. When you look at the figures , they are firmly drawn, almost hatched like Hogarth etchings, but the world they inhabit is all hints. In April 1768, the explorer Louis-Antoine de Bougainville discovered what he believed to be a living, real version of the isle of Venus: the southern pacific island of Tahiti. Bougainville was not the first European to land on Tahiti: the British sailor Samuel Wallis beat him by a few months. But it was the Frenchman who took imaginative possession of the island and its people. This place was paradise on earth, he reported. He named it New Cythera. Sailors' stories of uninhibited Tahitian women mingled with the myth of Cythera to create a paradise of the mind. Denis Diderot, champion of reason and enlightenment, wrote in 1773 a Supplement au Voyage de Bougainville, in which he portrays Tahiti as a utopia of libertarian sexuality. For Diderot, the Tahitians, free from Christian superstition, are able to take rational, healthy pleasure in one another's bodies. Far from driving them mad, or turning them into pox-ridden imbeciles, sex makes them happy. Pagan love was the Enlightenment's favourite fantasy. Watteau's Pilgrimage to Cythera stands near the beginning of this rococo revolution. Tahiti was a place the Enlightenment would have had to invent if it had not existed - and the Enlightenment did invent this place as an exotic corner of the European imagination, as opposed to somewhere real people lived. It was a libertine paradise where love was flower-trimmed and natural: Don Giovanni with a happy ending, Justine without the pain. The reality of 18th-century sexual freedom was brothels, pox, foundlings. Tahiti or New Cythera was a much lovelier image, a fantasy the greatest intellectuals could share with the common British sailors who, in 1789, miserable to have to sail away after six months on the island, cast adrift their captain, William Bligh, and turned the Bounty back to Tahiti and love. Watteau had painted the fantasy of Cythera; within years of the first European trespass, artists were portraying New Cythera. William Hodges sailed with Captain James Cook on his second Pacific voyage, as official artist of the Resolution, arriving at Tahiti in August 1773 - just six years after the first European saw it. He was sent there as a highly regarded artist, trained by the classical landscape painter Richard Wilson. The paintings Hodges made throughout the Pacific and, later, in India can be seen in William Hodges 1744-1797: The Art of Exploration, about to open at the National Maritime Museum in London. In Tahiti, like everyone else, he found paradise. It was not unblemished. Cook visited when Tahiti was at war with neighbouring Moorea, and Hodges realistically painted massed war canoes heading out to sea. But this documentary painting contrasts with his significantly titled Tahiti Revisited, painted in England in 1776 and synthesising his memories of the island in a grandly conceived landscape, much as Richard Wilson painted scenes in Italy. Tahiti Revisited is the first painting to locate paradise in the real landscape of this Polynesian island. Mountains rise ruggedly, caught in a golden light; tall, swaying trees shade a bubbling inlet, where people bathe naked. One lies face upward in the water, while friends dry themselves next to a Polynesian sacred stone carving, a tiki. Hodges's accurate - or at least recognisable - depiction of a tiki should make us think twice about automatically dismissing his image as a European colonial wet dream. Tahiti was always stranger than that. It was associated with revolution and mutiny: Diderot's libertine version of the Noble Savage is part of the cultural origins of the French Revolution, and the Bounty mutineers proved there was something violent, something dangerous about this island's promise of a golden age. All this is in Hodges's painting. Tahiti Revisited suggests a memory of the island, a nostalgia; it possesses the same air of loss, of the fragility of dreams, that scents Watteau's Pilgrimage to Cythera. Perhaps the idyll of Tahiti exists only in memory, which remakes it, adding a landscape sensibility formed by Claude and Wilson, abstracting experience into languid poetry. Perhaps the only people who ever truly tried to grasp this elusive image were the Bounty mutineers, and they ended up hanging from a gallows, or skulking in the rocky remoteness of Pitcairn Island - no paradise. The startling thing about this 18th-century British painting is that its central elements - naked beauty, bathing, woods, Polynesian artefacts - are all iconographically identical to the themes of the paintings, drawings, writings and carvings made on Tahiti more than a century later by Paul Gauguin. Gauguin was the inheritor of an idyll fully formed before the French Revolution. Essentially, nothing had changed in the European fantasy of Tahiti when he sailed there in 1891. Almost everything, however, had changed in Tahiti's reality. Readiness to trade with Europeans made Tahiti a favourite stopping place of whalers in the 19th century and opened its culture to the devastations of commerce and Christianity. Gauguin was shocked by the results. Instead of the happy, innocent pagan paradise he had been led to expect by popular literature directly descended from Enlightenment utopianism, he found corrupted, westernised victims of the missionaries, ruled by a puppet king. His first paintings of Tahiti are realistic. The three boys in The Meal wear European clothes, as does his lover in Tehamana Has Many Ancestors. Gauguin is not the inventor of Tahiti's myth. He is its mourner. Arriving to indulge himself like a Bounty mutineer, he created instead shadowed, sinister paintings that grieve for the fall of innocence. Far from blandly erotic nudes, his Tahitian women are isolated, brooding figures. They are aware of being watched. They are haunted by the past. Death infects Gauguin's paradise: he accepts his own death (which he found on the Marquesas, north east of Tahiti, in 1903) as the price of the greatest paintings about Eden since Watteau. In Nevermore, painted on Tahiti in 1897 and today in the Courtauld Gallery, a sinister blue and green bird watches a woman lying in a powerfully decorated room. Outside, two figures converse. She seems anxious about them, about the bird: her eyes are open, turning towards the uncomfortable personages. The foreground is dark. Paradise has turned out to be a difficult place. Can we return to Cythera? Nevermore. 00b7 William Hodges 1744-1797: The Art of Exploration is at the National Maritime Museum, London SE10, from Tuesday until November 12. Details: 020-8858 4422.  ",

   "input": "New varieties have made the old-fashioned weigela popular again. What to do this week: Keep mowing as long as your lawn continues to grow but lower the blade height to 1 00bd inches to make fall leaf raking easier. Run the gas tank empty before storing the mower for the winter. Collect desirable seeds for plants you want to grow next year such as poppies and columbine, while bagging undesirable weed seeds such as purple pokeweed for the garbage before they disperse. Q. I recently bought three weigela bushes (potted) in May and today they have doubled in size and are now blooming for the second time and the leaves are beginning to turn brown. Could you give me some advice as to their care? I 2019ve heard they should be cut back every year but I don 2019t know how far back that might mean, vertically and horizontally. A. The weigela (rhymes with tequila) is an Asian ornamental shrub once popular in old-fashioned gardens because it is tough and is covered with bright pink or red flowers in spring. Its biggest drawback has been its large size. But like Japanese spirea, weigelas are becoming popular again thanks to breeders who have developed new varieties that are much smaller, boast colored foliage and in some cases rebloom throughout the season. I assume you bought some of these new 201cminis 201d such as Midnight Wine, which are being heavily marketed. They may be turning brown from the drought unless you water them frequently, or they may just be going dormant. In any case, they will survive winter more easily in the ground than in a pot, so I suggest you plant them in a sunny spot about 5 feet wide to accommodate future growth, if you haven 2019t already done so. If the roots are growing in a circle when you pull them from the pot, tease them outward and make the planting hole twice the size of the pot. Water them every week we don 2019t get rain until the ground freezes to promote root establishment. As for pruning, the best time is right after their big show in the spring, before they start making more flowers, so you will not prune those off accidentally. I can 2019t tell you the dimensions for cutting because the new varieties grow to different sizes. But you can cut any branch off by a third. Cut it back to the point where two branches connect so you don 2019t leave a dead end stub that could become diseased. You will get a fuller bush if you use hand clippers instead of pruning shears and cut branches back individually instead of shearing. But in any case, hard pruning in the spring soon after bloom ends will result in a better looking, more heavily flowering bush. Older weigelas also respond to thinning, where you cut one in every three branches back all the way. Q. I have a large yard but, unlike my neighbors, no automated in-ground irrigation. With this drought everything is looking bad. But we got some rain this week. Do I still need to water? A. Yes, if your plants are wilting. September is usually one of the rainiest months. But the Blue Hills Observatory in Milton just recorded the driest September in its records, which go back to 1835. Sounds like climate change to me. While it is still warm, concentrate on watering fall vegetables, flowering annuals, and, most of all, plantings in containers. You should also water any trees or shrubs you have planted in the previous 12 months or that look distressed. But don 2019t water established woodies until after they have dropped their leaves. Don 2019t prune or fertilize them either, because you don 2019t want to stimulate new growth when they need to slow down and prepare for dormancy. In late fall, after the leaves have dropped, resume watering both deciduous and evergreen trees and shrubs. You want to saturate the soil so that they have a water reserve for coming out of dormancy. And the evergreens will need to draw on this soil moisture to protect themselves from desiccating winter winds. Young trees can be watered by a dripping hose placed near the trunk, but older trees like a sprinkler covering the entire area of their drip line. Don 2019t water your lawn unless you are starting grass seed or new turf. Grass that looks like it 2019s dying is only going dormant.

Loeb said that he has seen a massive improvement in the Japanese economy since he started looking at it a year ago.

He says the country 2019s new political leadership is making changes that will make their economy more efficient and spur growth.

The oil giant had appealed the settlement, claiming that it let businesses collect despite being unable to prove their damages were linked to the spill. The company had lost previous appeals in lower courts. The decision Monday marks a major setback for BP, which wanted to reduce amount of damages it would pay. Plaintiffs accused the company of merely trying to nullify a settlement it had already agreed to. Here are 10 important numbers to know about settlement and the company 2019s legal challenge. 4.25: The amount of dollars in billions BP is expected to pay in claims to businesses and individuals affected by the oil spill, according to Bloomberg, and from statistics gathered by Patrick Juneau, the administrator in charge of handling the claims. So far, the company has paid about $2.3 billion. 5: The number of U.S. states affected by the spill, including Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. 11: The number of lives lost as a result of the oil spill. Thousands of animals were killed too. 43: The number in billions that BP has set aside to resolve claims related to the spill. BP already settled U.S. criminal charges and agreed to pay $4.5 billion in fines related to that. In January, BP will go on trial for penalties associated with the U.S. Clean Water Act. It could pay as much as $18 billion for that, according to Reuters. 67: The percentage of the spill that BP was found to be at fault for, according to U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier. Transocean RIG was found to be responsible for 30% and Halliburton just 3% HAL , according to Bloomberg. 87: The number of days that passed before the well was capped in September 2010. 121: BP 2019s market capitalization as of 4pm EST. Shares of the company were trading over 2.7% lower for the day after the court 2019s decision was announced. 200: The gallons of oil spilled in millions. That 2019s also measured in 4.9 million barrels of oil, according to the Smithsonian. 2010: The year the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded which prompted the spill. The day was April 20. 2014: The year when a U.S. District court found that BP was responsible for the spill due to gross negligence and misconduct. The judge made the ruling in September.  ",

Dump truck and tractor maker Caterpillar CAT (#49 on the Fortune 500), personal care product maker Colgate-Palmolive CL (#167) and insurance company Chubb CB (#208) all spent tens of thousands of dollars to lobby government officials this year about the Cuban embargo, according to regulatory documents. Businesses have been pushing the federal government to lift trade restrictions with Cuba for some time. But those efforts seemed to ramp up in May when a number of political figures and corporate executives including Enrique Sosa, the former president of Dow Chemical North America, and George Weiksner, the vice chairman of Credit Suisse, signed an open letter to President Obama suggesting ways to 201cincrease support for Cuban civil society. 201d The companies that disclosed Cuba-related lobbying this year could all stand to gain from the embargo being lifted. But the White House 2019s decision Wednesday falls short of opening the doors to full trade, which requires Congressional approval. With the limited changes, companies will be able to peddle agricultural equipment, residential building materials and equipment for small businesses. Secretary of State John Kerry said that normalizing ties with Cuba means 201cgreater regional stability and economic opportunities for American businesses. 201d In its filing in April, Caterpillar said that it had spent $1.7 million on lobbying related to a broad range of issues including the Cuba Reconciliation Act, the Free Trade with Cuba Act, the United States-Cuba Normalization Act and the Promoting American Agricultural and Medical Exports to Cuba Act 2013 all of which would increase trade with Cuba. Bill Lane, a global government affairs director at Caterpillar, voiced support for the White House 2019s decision on Cuba. 201cWe are pleased with the announcement today, 201d he told Fortune. 201cIt 2019s a good step in the right direction. 201d He added that the company has funded lobbying efforts for 201cwell over a decade 201d and that 201cengagement can be a powerful force. 201d The legal firm Baker & Hostetler, meanwhile, filed two separate lobbying disclosures on behalf of Colgate-Palmolive with more vague and wide-reaching goals. In addition to work related to U.S.-India business relationship and economic development in Costa Rica, the lobbyists pushed for economic development in Cuba. The firm collected $160,000 for its work in the second quarter and $360,000 in the following quarter. The third Fortune 500 company listed by the database, Chubb, filed three lobbying reports entirely related to Cuba and the embargo.

We have an opportunity to have a 60-inch set with 1080p high-definition, 201d he says, his voice rising with a mixture of frustration and excitement. 201cIt 2019s within our grasp. 201d For seven years Santos has run Audience Inc, a chip-maker that specializes in translating the human voice into digital bits and back to voice again without garbling the conversation. Audience chips are now in over 40 million mobile phones, mainly to help to filter out the background noise. (That way, a bus going by doesn 2019t drown out your conversation.) Along the way Santos has learned a lot about why cell phones calls sound so bad to the human ear. While noise suppression helps, there 2019s only so much Santos has been able to do given limitations of today 2019s cellular networks. Those networks have two glaring quality flaws. They 2019re slow, adding a noticeable lag between when one caller talks and the other hears their words, leading to overlapping talk. They are also short on capacity, encouraging wireless carriers to smoosh phone calls into tiny digital streams and in the process lose all the little audio nuances that make a conversation sound lifelike. Now a new high-def era is finally dawning, says Santos. Verizon VZ and AT&T T have said this month that they plan on launching 201cVoice over LTE 201d in 2012 and 2013 respectively. LTE, the most popular 201c4G 201d standard, is capable of crystal-clear calls with no noticeable lag. 201cThe joke in the industry used to be is that wideband cellular is two years away 2014and always has been, 201d says Santos. 201cOur view is that now that has changed. 201d LTE systems will carry more digital bits at lower cost 2014and the more bits a phone call uses the better the call sounds. U.S. cellular system typically smush a call into 6 or 7 kilobits per second, leading to mediocre sound under the best of circumstances. (Looked at in terms of audible frequencies, today 2019s phones only pass along frequencies between 300 hertz and 3500 hertz, a fraction of the pitches the ear can detect. But by doubling or tripling the bits devoted to each call, new 201cwideband 201d phones could pass along all audible frequencies.) Santos is already building chips for this new high-def world, including a new one released last week. He says that as we get the improved phones there will be even more need for clever noise-supression technologies. That 2019s because in the new, higher frequencies that LTE phones will carry, background noise is an relatively bigger problem. In the meantime, Audience 2019s chips will help today 2019s cell phone sound better with new tricks to paper over the network problems. One example: the chip lets your phone fill in the missing frequencies in today 2019s networks, creating the illusion of greater bandwidth. But that 2019s only a short-term fix, until hi-def handsets take over. Daniel Beringer, an industry consultant and expert in hi-def telephony, agrees that will happen faster than people expect. He says that companies like Google GOOG , Skype, Orange, Audience and others are laying the groundwork by creating HD capable technologies. Right now, most HD capable phones connect to regular phones and must default to the old quality standards. As more people get HD capable phones, a feedback loop starts, and the number of HD conversations will soar, Beringer predicts. Once people hear what they are missing, demand will explode he predicts. 201cEach person that gets it becomes the salesperson for their family, 201d he says. 201cIt 2019s just like putting on a pair of glasses for the first time. There 2019s a huge hearing impairment you didn 2019t really notice before. 201d Adds Peter Santos: 201cThere 2019s a tipping point. It 2019s very close. 201d  ",

I love that she openly talks about being 201c50 50 2033, a balance of intuition and feeling with hardcore analysis and how that has contributed to her success. She embraces the people side of business and uses that as a strength to propel the company forward. What technology sector excites you most?

With that uncertainty behind us, I feel it 2019s crucial for entrepreneurs to focus their energies on uniting around a single healthcare reform that will create jobs and facilitate greater innovation in America. As a young single person, I don 2019t have the same worries that many have taking the risk of starting a new company. So I can afford a reasonable individual health plan, without sacrificing my entrepreneurial spirit. But many older creative people, or those with families, cannot. Instead, they remain in stagnant positions because they need health insurance continuity, rather than starting their own companies or even simply joining smaller less secure ventures. When you factor in those individuals and or their family members who may have chronic conditions 2013 more restrictions are placed on those individuals seeking a better or more entrepreneurial opportunity. This restricts employees from becoming employers and reduces the velocity of our nation 2019s job creation. So what needs to be done? At the core 2013 we must fundamentally change how we pay for healthcare. By its very nature, the employer-provided health insurance system of today limits portability, and restricts employees from becoming entrepreneurs. I believe the single most important reform needed is to provide true health insurance portability 2013 and here 2019s why: If employees 201cowned 201d their insurance they would have the ability to navigate jobs, start their own companies or simply join a start-up 2013 and our economy would see rapid growth and accelerated innovation.

Our current healthcare system prevents the needed 201crisk taking 201d required for entrepreneurship 2013 and so ideas are stifled and dreams never become a reality. Regardless of your political persuasion entrepreneurs should unite around the common belief that everyone should control their own healthcare and own their health insurance and ultimately their own destiny.

(AAP) Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced he is cutting his salary by 10 percent as well as the earnings of several top government officials, as the country's economy reels from the collapse of the rouble. The salaries of Putin, his Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Prosecutor General Yury Chaika and the president of the powerful Investigative Committee Alexander Bastrykin, will all be cut by 10 percent from March 1 to December 31, according to a decree signed by the president. The wage reduction also applies to all of those employed by the presidency and the council of ministers. The move comes less than a year after the Kremlin announced the tripling of Putin's salary. The president, who claims to live a frugal lifestyle, was earning less than his ministers in 2013. Russia's economy has been hard hit by the western sanctions for the country's role in backing separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine, which along with falling oil prices led to a dramatic crash of the rouble in December to half its value against the US dollar.

But just as the MIT Blackjack team figured out how to beat the odds in Las Vegas, Y Combinator figured out how to beat the odds in tech investing. Y Combinator, which started in Cambridge but now is in Silicon Valley, is the largest and most successful startup incubator in history. Over the past 10 years, Y Combinator provided seed funding and support to 842 companies. Nearly 80 percent of those companies are still operating 2014 most early stage tech investors expect half their startups to fail 2014 and 32 are worth more than $100 million each. All together, Y Combinator companies are worth a combined $30 billion. Dropbox is one of the companies that went through Y Combinator 2019s Cambridge program. And it 2019s one that local investors missed. I remember the Demo Day in 2007 when Dropbox presented to about 30 Boston area investors. None invested, and Dropbox moved to Silicon Valley soon after. Investors, including me, balked, largely because Microsoft, Google, and other big technology companies offered cloud storage and backup for free or very low cost. How could Dropbox possibly compete? Well, Y Combinator advised Dropbox to identify early adopters, focus on ease of use, and compete with the technology giants. This year, Dropbox is expected to launch an initial public stock offering valued at more than $10 billion. So, what is Y Combinator? It is a startup that creates more startups. Y Combinator attracts the best entrepreneurs, who in turn attract the best investors, which leads to the highest valuations, which attract the best advisers, who bring it full circle by attracting the best entrepreneurs. For several years, Y Combinator held a summer session in Cambridge and a winter session in Mountain View, Calif. After comparing results, especially local investor participation, it became clear the program could be more successful holding both sessions in Silicon Valley. Despite deep local roots in Boston, Y Combinator moved west in 2009. In Y Combinator 2019s early years, about 10 companies presented products and ideas to no more than 30 investors at the end of each session. The presentations at these 201cdemo 201d days were folksy and unpolished. The companies were typically valued at around $3 million. Recently, about 115 companies made pitches over two days to about 500 investors. Valuations have skyrocketed to $10 million, $20 million, or more. The hottest companies get funded very quickly. Still, Y Combinator 2019s greatest legacy might be that it paved the way for many other startup incubators and accelerators. TechStars Boston and MassChallenge are doing a great job accelerating local startups. Bolt, Blade, UMass Venture Development Center, and several others are supporting the startup ecosystem. For many years, Boston area investors have been more cautious than their West Coast counterparts. Mark Zuckerberg famously left here for Silicon Valley to find risk takers to help him build Facebook. Boston has great universities, experienced entrepreneurs, and plenty of venture capital. But we need a concerted effort from investors to step up, get involved, and put their money into local startups.  ",

Americans filled 4.3 million prescriptions and doled out nearly $374 billion on medicine in 2014, according to new data from the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics. The data shows that nationwide pending on medicine hit the highest level since 2001, up 13% in 2014 from the year before. In states that expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act, patients filled 25.4% more prescriptions than in 2013; in states that did not expand eligibility, that rate was 2.8%. Overall, doctors 2019 office visits declined 3% and dispensed prescriptions increased 2.1% in 2014. 201cIt is clear that the U.S. health care system is in a state of flux, 201d wrote IMS Health executive director Murray Aitken in the report. 201cThe past year brought fundamental changes and heightened uncertainty to patients, payers, providers, government and lawmakers. 201d The report authors also note that the impact of patent expirations also happened to be lower in 2014, so the drop in costs was smaller than drops experienced in other years. The report shows that the impact of patent expiries in 2014 was around $8 billion less than 2013 and $17 billion less than what it was in 2012. The report suggests that specialty drugs and innovative medicines accounted for a large part of the medication spending, with specialty medicines making up a third of all medication spending. Some of these drugs were new treatments for diseases like hepatitis C, multiple sclerosis and cancer. New oral hepatitis C drugs, for example, have made treating the disorder easier than taking the daily injections that were previously required. However these new drugs can have a high price tag 2014 around $1,000 for a single daily pill in some cases. The report says new treatments for hepatitis C increased spending by $11.3 billion. 201cThe number of patients seeking treatment for hepatitis C jumped nearly tenfold in 2014, from 17 to 161 thousand, owing to new treatments with cure rates over 90% and dramatically fewer side effects, 201d the report reads. According to IMS Health, 18 orphan drugs 2014 ones designed specifically to treat a rare disorder 2014 were launched in 2014. The unprecedented high was likely due in part to the tax breaks and other financial incentives for developing them. All of these factors made 2014 an especially notable year for medicine spending and new innovative medicine, IMS Health said. Watch more business news from Fortune:  ",

   "input": "'It was hard labour by any measure, says Jake Chapman , recalling his and brother Dinos's apprenticeship as assistants to Gilbert and George. There was absolutely no creative input at all. They were very polite and it was interesting to hear them talking 2013 as we did our daily penance. What did the work involve? Colouring in their prints. We coloured in Gilbert and George's penises for eight hours a day. At least you didn't have to pay , as Rembrandt's assistants did, for the privilege of working in the master's studio. Oh , we paid, retorts Chapman. We paid in dignity. The relationship between artist and artist's assistant is vexed , ripe for oedipal tensions, mutual resentments, or at least spitting in the great master's lapsang souchong. How tired, one suspects, Lucian Freud's assistant (and painter in his own right) David Dawson, got of being called Dave the Slave by his late master. John Lanchester's recent novel Capital captures this two-way vexation when an artist called Smitty , modelled on Banksy, sacks his assistant. The decisive factor was his assistant's way of making it clear that in his judgment , he and not Smitty was the person who should be treated as the famous artist, writes Lanchester. The fact that he hadn't actually made any art since leaving St Martins , the fact that all he did was chores for Smitty, seemed in his mind to be a minor, disregardable detail ... Well, thought Smitty, he can piss right off with that. But what's most striking about the artist-assistant relationship is how it is airbrushed from public consciousness. Behind every great artist might well be a highly skilled team of assistants , but that truth is suppressed for fear of shattering our illusions: the lone-genius myth helps sales, and is partly what gives an artwork its mystique. When David Hockney's 23-year-old assistant Dominic Elliott died on Sunday after being rushed to hospital from the artist's home in the Yorkshire town of Bridlington, much press attention focused on the entourage the artist has working for him. Elliott had helped Hockney install his show last year at London's Royal Academy, and worked as his driver. Hockney has several other assistants working for him, including a full-time technical PA with his own staff. He has a film crew who have toured the Yorkshire Wolds to make landscape film productions, using nine video cameras. Suddenly Hockney's unremarkable seaside house seemed to be an art world Tardis concealing a hitherto ignored workshop of assistants, like Andy Warhol's Factory, though 2013 with respect to Bridlington 2013 less glamorous. Giving up that lone-genius idea is hard. The idea of the genius struggling in solitude in a cockroached and frozen garret with only a crust of bread and syphilis for company is an historically specific vision no longer , if ever, of relevance, argued Stephen Bayley this week writing about Hockney's studio. Artists are not solitary. They rely on human support systems , often of a very sophisticated sort. No doubt , but there's more of a paradox here 2013 and more pathos 2013 than Bayley allows. It's Tracey Emin's name on the tent, even if an unsung underling worked on the stitching. Many minions painted Damien Hirst's dots (among them was Lauren Child, who went on to create Charlie and Lola and, when I tried to talk to her about it, preferred not to remember her grunt work) even if he took the credit for the results. Even if Hockney's RA show was the work of many (not least those who built his iPad), it was his name that induced art lovers to queue in the rain in Burlington House's courtyard. Earlier this week, a 17th-century portrait of a man in velvet hat and two ostrich feathers was re-attributed to Rembrandt after more than four decades of having been assumed to have been painted by one of his pupils. The painting, which hangs in the dining room of Sir Francis Drake's old home of Buckland Abbey in Devon, clearly depicted the Dutch master and bore Rembrandt's signature, but that was long regarded as no guarantee that he painted it. New x-ray evidence suggests it was his work alone. The re-attribution made the painting newly important, even while it remained physically what it was the day before. As a result, according to David Taylor, curator of paintings and sculpture at the National Trust, the self-portrait now becomes one of our most important works of art and will be the only Rembrandt in the National Trust's collection of approximately 13 , 500 paintings. For Chapman , this is disturbing, since what he calls the possessive claim on a work of art obscures what makes it worth seeing. The 'I' eclipses the thing. When someone slings our work on the back of a van , for me it's gone and no longer mine. What a relief! After it goes, the work is open to interpretation. The artist stands by like a spurned village idiot. But what about the assistant who sees in the gallery a work to which they made a decisive contribution , and yet is labelled only with the artist's signature? What about all those poor saps who paid Rembrandt and then wound up helping him to crank out paintings for which he got the kudos? Chapman is unsentimental: Does the person who makes the hubcaps or whatever they're called these days 2013 low-profile sports rims 2013 point at a passing Mercedes SLK or whatever it's called , saying, 'I did that?' No. So why should assistants claim possession for their work? It's a job. Mike Smith has produced work for artists , including the Chapmans. In 2001 he and others assembled an 11-and-a-half ton polyurethane resin piece on the fourth plinth at Trafalgar Square for artist Rachel Whiteread. It took three years to make. Not that Smith was complaining. There are people who latch on to the fact that artists are not making things themselves , he told the Guardian last year. The moral outrage 2013 the idea that we're all being duped because we're paying all this money for work that's not being made by the artists themselves 2013 is ridiculous. There can , however, be a great deal of pathos in the role of the assistant. Ashley Hipkin has worked as one of sculptor Antony Gormley's assistants for the past 10 years. After graduating in sculpture from London's Central Saint Martins college in 1996, he spent his 20s working in a restaurant and as a builder while establishing a sculpture practice. I was floundering a bit , but then I moved to the north-east. There he started teaching and garnered interest from local galleries in his work. But , aged 30, he found himself struggling financially, and applied to work for Gormley. Antony offered me the job and I spent a month debating whether I should take it. But in the end , I accepted. The decision was based on needing a regular income. I had a family by then. Do you have regrets? I sometimes regret that I have let go of my own practice. Maybe I'm doing it because I'm not brave enough to strike out on my own. I've gained a great deal of satisfaction of thinking of the work I have done for Antony , but it's not the same as the pride one feels when you do your own work. I have been having that internal dialogue for a long time. Hipkin learned early on of the pleasures 2013 and sorrows 2013 of being an artist's assistant when , in 2003, he and others worked on Gormley's show Domain Field at the Baltic in Gateshead. They cast 280 members of the public, aged from two to 85, in plaster to create moulds that were then used to make individual sculptures by a laborious process involving welding steel elements together into each mould. It wasn't just technically demanding. It was a bit of a love-in , recalls Hipkin. I loved the work. And then suddenly it's not your work any more , but Antony's. But not , Hipkin makes clear, because Gormley is a grotesque megalomaniac. It's the media or the world that takes the work away from you. Antony fully realises there are collaborative elements. He sits in on the studio crits , when there are six or seven people taking part in a real dialogue about the evolution of the idea. There's a joint ownership of what's happening, though Antony still has a grip on everything conceptually. Unlike the Chapman brothers' work for Gilbert and George , Hipkin's work for Gormley is creatively engaging. Each assistant is given quite a lot of autonomy to push the work forward. Antony drives the work conceptually , but it's very collaborative. I get as interested in his practice and in the relationship between the body and modernism as he does. He's enjoyed the travel the work has entailed , and revels in the creative input. He's thrived too, as Gormley's practice has, as it's become more internationally lucrative in the past decade. Then he checks himself. Maybe I've painted it too positively. There is an anxiety about ploughing your creative energy into someone else's work. Richard Wentworth , professor of sculpture at the Royal College of Art, recalls working as Henry Moore's assistant in 1967. He was there for a short term to learn what he could before setting up his own practice. I was a callow boy at Henry's , but those procedural days stay with me, the sounds of the radio and news of the day. For me then there was deference , and an engaging job of work. We made small things bigger. Not such a bad metaphor. It's fun to learn process and procedure in context, and to do more or less what you are told. There's a time limit, of course, and each has to know what's in it for him. Moore needed assistants such as Wentworth and Anthony Caro because of the growing monumentality of his work. Wentworth's later practice as a sculptor in the 1970s , one might think, turned away from his master's oeuvre: I find cigarette packets folded up under table legs more monumental than a Henry Moore , he said once. Five reasons. Firstly , the scale. Secondly, the fingertip manipulation. Thirdly, modesty of both gesture and material. Fourth, its absurdity and fifth, the fact that it works. It's almost as though Wentworth the ex-assistant had oedipal issues with his former master. Any close collaboration involves exchanges of power and patience and skill , says Wentworth diplomatically. Much more fun if there are episodes of co-learning. Henry was benign and said all sorts of 'wise' things , which I still remember. His inverted commas , not mine. What happens when an assistant becomes an artist and takes on their own assistant? For example, does the hard labour Gilbert and George inflicted on the Chapmans get visited by the Chapmans on their minions? Quite possibly. So much of our art is about industrialised slaughter , it makes sense it's made by industrialised labour, says Jake. Perhaps our poor assistants should rise up against us. He's joking. We pay them well , and they get fed and they have a nice time. As far as I'm concerned, having an assistant multiplies what you can do. It's dependent on the idea that a) you don't have the time to learn a skill, and b) you can't be bothered to learn it. Perhaps there's even a c) the Chapmans learned from experience with Gilbert and George how mind-numbing the donkey work can be and so devolve it on to underlings. In fact , the Chapmans provide studio space for their assistants to do their own work if they want. But that's all. I think it's incredibly patronising to get involved in supervising their artistic development. Those philanthropic , paternal gestures are completely alien to us. We're not here to mentor them. They're here to work for us. Do you get resentful when your assistants get ideas above their station? Oh yes , laughs Jake. If there's a hint of them being successful artists , I will fire them immediately. Again he is , probably, joking.  ",

   "input": "By John Leonard OLD GLORY. An American Voyage. By Jonathan Raban. 409 pages. Simon & Schuster. $16.95. IN his wonderful book ''Arabia: A Journey Through the Labyrinth,'' Jonathan Raban meets Jan Morris in Cairo. Mr. Raban has been ''drifting into a vein of gloomy Gothic.'' The sensible Miss Morris cheers him up: ''She was a proper traveler, with the traveler's gift for swimming in the stream without drowning in it; while I was a natural candidate for drowning.'' In Mr. Raban's equally wonderful ''Old Glory,'' he fails to drown.After 1,400 miles on the Mississippi River, from Minneapolis to New Orleans and beyond, in a borrowed 16-foot Mirrocraft - a ''mustardcolored shell of aluminum'' less like a boat or a fish or a bird than like ''some new, efficient brand of nonstick saucepan'' - he is, in every sense of the word, buoyant. He may be a snow goose but he is not an armadillo; to understand the difference, you must read his book. Author Is Surveyed Of course, like the Huck Finn he has dreamed about since he was 7 years old, he is running away from civilization and its disc ontents. But he is acc ompanied by credit cards, navigational charts, pecans, bourbon, Vali um and a book contract. For a professed agnostic, he stops at a su rprising number of churches. And, as if attached by an elastic strin g to some idea of the big city, he will snap back, out of the bayous by jet stream to London. What must the Middle West have made of this witty, pipe-smoking Englishman? On the river, the lock-keepers and tow-boat captains revile him for his incompetent audacity; the fishermen consider him frivolous; the yachtsmen nod off over their vodka martinis while their wives are motherly; although the bears and snakes and alligators keep their distance, the vultures look him over. On shore - and Mr. Raban spends every night on shore, being as sensible as Jan Morris - he is generally treated as an exotic pet. The river shrugs him off; when it isn't indifferent, it is malign, with its stumps, ''sawyers,'' eddies, boils and wakes. His is not a cozy river. The Mississippi inspires wonder and revulsion. It smells. It is seldom a friend and often an enemy. It consists impartially of sunsets and sludge. One boil is ''a grotesque, animated flower, spilling enormous petals of water from its center. It was bringing up horrible things from the bottom: rotten stumps, branches gone feathery and white with mold, chunks of black peaty stuff - all the garbage of the riverbed was being scoured out and scattered on the surface. I was certain that if I watched it long enough it would start to spew out bodies, boats, skulls.'' In other words, the river is very much like St. Louis, where he pauses to have a love affair, and Memphis, where he stays a while to support a black preacher who is running for Mayor. As for the smaller towns, Mr. Raban doesn't like them if they've turned their backs on the river, sold out to the railroads. Where is their pride? The levee means more to him than the shopping mall. He prefers Vicksburg, almost against his will, to Natchez, because Vicksburg held out against the Union Army and Natchez is a stage-set for Hollywood movies about plantation life. When Mr. Raban isn't in church or in a bar, he is at a pig roast ora Knights of Columbus picnic. Or the Hell's A ngels are stealing his hat. The variety of people willing to talk to him astonishes: politicians and policemen, newspaper editors and river riffraff, an Arab banker and a Catholic priest, a hog butc her and a taxidermist. The last two are not for the squeamish, but M r. Raban specializes in quick-combustion friendships and is intereste d in everything, from what happened to the factories that made pear l buttons out of clam shells to how to tree a coon. The hog butcher smokes a cigar ''as bigas a submarine sandwich.'' And taxidermy, we are told, is like psychoanalysis: ''In life, these animals have possessed the particular identity of their personal quirks and disorders - their sagging bellies, twisted hind legs, scraggy rumps. Taxidermy restored them all to the standard shape of a normal, well-adjusted coon. The molds came in different sizes but made no allowance for any variety of diet or behavior. A coon was a coon was a coon.'' Mr. Raban's passage is from Labor Day weekend to just before Christmas 1980. It is a time of visits from Jimmy Carter and Pope John Paul II; we are held hostage in Iran. Almost everybody he talks to feels that America is going down the drain. At the same time, there is a Middle Western defensiveness and resentment: as the river brought lax morals and radical ideas from the big cities to the small towns, so the coasts of East and West homogenize and cheapen the culture. I suppose that is the meaning of ''Old Glory'': our flag is tattered. As meanings go, this one doesn't get anywhere, not even as far as the Becky Thatcher book shop in Hannibal, Mo. Unpredictable Opinions No matter. Mr. Raban - comparing Jackson Square in New Orleans to the Piazza della Signoria in Florence; explaining how most black political dynasties in the South are based on funeral-home fortunes; worrying about his teeth - is excellent company. He is a popcorn popper of opinions, and they are unpredictable. If he picks occasionally on easy targets, such as polyester and state fairs, more often he is surprised and pleased to be afloat, and he is altogether innocent of Blimpy chauvinism. Only once is he completely wrong. The American language, he says, has a ''fatal preference for theories, principles, concepts, over mere material objects and their intractable thinginess.'' This, coming from someone who has actually studied Arabic, is preposterous. Illustrations: photo of Jonathan Raban  ",

   "input": "Garry Trudeau, the creator of the ''Doonesbury'' comic strip that exposes some of the social foibles and political follies of our time, was encountered the other afternoon breaking open a fortune cookie. It arrived with a pot of tea; never mind where. Mr. Trudeau, who treasures his privacy, found a touch of wisdom in the serendipitous message: ''Keep your plans secret for now.'' Mr. Trudeau's sense of privacy, however, does not extend to his views. At 32 Mr. Trudeau, whose outspoken characters owe a historic debt to such cartoonists as Jules Feiffer and the late Walt Kelly, describes himself as an aging agitator. He earned his bachelor's degree at Yale, then gained what might be called his graduate education in Vietnam and as a student of Watergate - two lasting touchstones in his background. The aging agitator finds inspirational material in more recent political history, too. His next two cartoon collections, to be published in September by Holt, Rinehart & Winston, are called ''The People's Doonesbury: Notes from Underfoot 1978-1980'' and ''In Search of Reagan's Brain.'' Mr. Trudeau's jabs at the high and mighty disturb some editors and enchant his fans. One of his pictorial techniques is to show only the exterior of the White House, with its unseen occupants chattering away, rarely to their advantage. During the Watergate hearings, Mr. Trudeau had his disk jockey character, Marvelous Mark, conclude his report on Mr. Nixon's Attorney General, John Mitchell, by dancing an ecstatic jig to cries of ''Guilty, guilty, guilty!'' The Washington Post killed the cartoon and somewhat stuffily explained: ''We cannot have one standard for the news pages and another for the comics.'' Today ''Doonesbury'' runs in the rival Washington Star. Twenty-one books have been derived from the strip, which runs in 600-odd papers around the country. About 80 of these papers put him on the editorial page. It would probably surprise some newspaper editors to discover that Mr. Trudeau prefers to be on the comic page instead of in the editorial realm. He finds nothing wrong with being labeled a comic-strip artist, and believes, besides, that more people read the comics than the editorials. In his book-lined studio in Manhattan, he keeps bound volumes of the comic-book series ''Classics Illustrated.'' Sipping his tea, Mr. Trudeau described how he dreams up his cartoons. He spends a good deal of time watching television, going to the movies, reading newspapers and magazines. One thing he doesn't do is walk around with a notebook. He also strongly believes that it is better for him to be an outsider than to fraternize with important people. In ''Doonesbury,'' he says, he wants to represent the outsider on the American scene. Mr. Trudeau regards himself as more of an idea-and-words man than a polemicist. The idea, which he puts down on yellow legal pads, comes first; then he blocks out what his characters will say; finally the sketching is done, at the eleventh hour. After relaxing on the weekend, he says that on Monday morning he wakes up his characters and tells them: ''O.K., guys, back to work.'' The impudent, clever dialogue (rather than the drawings of his bleary-eyed characters, whose drooping lids leave the impression that they could use a good night's sleep) is what propels a Trudeau panel. One of the breakthroughs Mr. Trudeau achieved in ''Doonesbury'' was to have his quasi-fictional characters, such as Michael J. Doonesbury, Zonker Harris or Uncle Duke, brush up against public figures whose real names are used in the strip. When he did a strip about ''The White House Years,'' he identified the author as Henry Kissinger but retitled the book ''The White Wash Years.'' And he had one of his characters, the intrepid TV correspondent Roland Hedley, do an interview with dialogue that went, ''O.K., look, the guy's clearly a war criminal. Granted, Henry Kissinger had much to answer for, but need so many trees have died for the cause?'' Lately, Gay Talese has turned up by name as a ''sexual adventurer,'' and David (''Tome'') Halberstam has been described as the author of very fat books. Mr. Trudeau's offhand philosophy about cartoons is that you have to care about your characters, because if you don't, the reader won't; that the aim to entertain must come before the desire to be a commentator. A cartoonist must keep all this in delicate balance, trying to find a happy combination in which the drawing is an instrument for conveying ideas. Otherwise, he believes, you cannot move people. The late Jim Andrews of Universal Press Syndicate, who discovered Garry Trudeau's strip in the Yale Daily News and syndicated it, advised him to pace himself: If you do a strip about carpet bombing one week, do a strip about football the next week. That remains his approach. Despite his modest description of himself as simply a comic-strip artist, Mr. Trudeau aims for the jugular as often as he aims to please. Another cup of tea, another fortune cookie. Garry Trudeau broke it open and grinned his crooked smile. This one read: ''Every man is a volume if you know how to read him.''

Mr. Meyer, for the record, did the sets for the last Claude McNeal show and for the current offering. ''Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat'' is a British rock musical by the team of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber, who are best known on this side of the Atlantic for ''Jesus Christ Superstar'' and the current ''Evita.'' ''Joseph'' is a short musical, running a minute or two over an hour. The show's attitude is revealed in the title. While the Bible refers to Joseph as being given ''a coat of many colors,'' Mr. Rice and Mr. Webber call it a ''Technicolor dreamcoat.'' In other words, here is a supposedly hip version of the Old Testament's story of Joseph, whose brothers were jealous of him and the handsome coat his father, Jacob, had given to him. They sell Joseph into Egypt, telling their father that his son is dead. Joseph, meanwhile, rises to high position in the service of the Pharaoh, interpreting the ruler's dreams. In time Joseph is reunited with his brothers, whom he forgives. The show dates from 1968, when it was created for the schoolboy choir at the Colet Court School in London. An expanded version appeared in London's West End with success in 1973. The dates are interesting since they suggest a later stage of rock in what appears on the stage at the Downtown Cabaret. As directed by Judith Lisi - who appeared as an actress under Claude McNeal's direction as Judy Lisi - and choreographed by Leo Muller, the show suggests a creation that came along seconds after the Twist. Most of the dance movements are stiff-armed circles that end in pointing gestures. Hips swivel almost continuously. The story is largely related by a narrator, dressed in tails and singing through a hand-held microphone. The singing and dancing chorus is made up of Joseph's brothers, who come in assorted sizes, shapes and numbers. Though the lyrics refer to Jacob as having 12 sons, there were times when, according to my count, Joseph and his brothers numbered 10 and other times when the total came to 11. There were also four leggy female dancers who seemed to favor a collective Brooklynese when they sang. ''Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat'' is more interesting musically than it is lyrically. Granted there is a certain rhythmic sameness throughout the score, but now and again a pleasant melody surfaces. Lyrically there are too many rhymes such as ''And now this coat has got our goat'' for any deep interest. There are also times when the creators have departed completely from their rock concept and even the biblical setting. There is the ''Benjamin Calypso,'' which sounds and looks as if everyone had suddenly moved to Nassau or Jamaica. And there is ''Those Canaan Days'' with a decidedly French apache flavor to it. This last number is the high point of the show as performed by Bob Filipowich, who has a rich voice and a great deal of style. In the leading role, Michael McKenzie was a fully serviceable tour guide to the brief evening as narrator. Timothy Dunigun portrayed Pharaoh as an Elvis Presley hip-twitcher with a smoky voice and stopped the show. Edward J. Crader Jr. grinned his way through the role of Joseph. The script suggests a bit of conceitedness about Joseph - after all he was his father's favorite - but I could find nothing to keep me from thinking of a used-car salesman I didn't trust. All in all, the Downtown Cabaret has created a very serviceable and entertaining production of ''Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.'' Technically, it should not be criticized but rather recognized for what it was originally, a 20-minute piece for a school choir that someone has expanded and that succeeded at a time when producers were positive that rock was what theater audiences wanted. Other than taking a flippant attitude toward a biblical story, the creators of the show never set any definite style to their works. Therefore, for ''Joseph'' to succeed it needs great style imposed on the production. Judith Lisi has certainly done that. If more could be done to disguise the fact that ''Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat'' is essentially a thin joke, I don't know what it is. Certainly the production should please the kiddies, and it makes for a pleasant family entertainment. Better yet, it turns on the lights of the Downtown Cabaret Theater again, and that makes it a decided asset to Bridgeport. Please note if you are considering attending that ''Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat'' plays Thursdays through Sundays only at 7:30 P.M. On Fridays and Saturdays there is a second show at 9:30 P.M. --------------------------------------------------------------------- ''Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat,'' by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber.

   "input": "LAS VEGAS, Nev., Sept. 15 2014 It finally happens tomorrow night. Sugar Ray Leonard and Thomas Hearns will meet in a 20-foot ring built atop a tennis court across the road from the desert. The words will stop and the punches will begin. ''This is a fight that needs no hype,'' Leonard had said before going on a two-week tour to promote the fight. The promoters say that 250 million people, or one-sixteenth of the world's population, will be watching the two welterweight champions in the bout to unify the title. Leonard and Hearns will be fighting for more money than any other two boxers in history - Leonard for possibly close to $13 million but certainly more than his record $9.7 million, Hearns for a bit more than $5 million. The promotion could gross close to $40 million, a record, and net about $24 million, another record. Sugar Ray Robinson never made more than $40,000 for a welterweight bout. And to put tomorrow's fight in context, Lou Duva, the fight manager whose son Dan is the promoter, says Leonard and Hearns would be no contest for Robinson in his prime. But Leonard and Hearns certainly are two of the best fighters in any 1981 weight division, and their meeting is one of the most eagerly awaited ones since Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier got together for the first time 10 years ago. ''This is a fist fight,'' Teddy Brenner, the former Madison Square Garden matchmaker, said, in summing up the basic attraction. Leonard, by far the most popular fighter in the world, is meeting a menacing figure in Hearns, an unbeaten 6-foot-1-inch welterweight with a powerful right hand that has helped account for most of the 30 knockouts in his 32 victories. ''I think people consider this fight as a monster against an ordinary guy,'' said Leonard, who is no ordinary boxer. His only loss, to Roberto Duran, mars a record that includes 30 victories, 21 by knockout (including the Duran rematch), and two world titles. A Rare Unification Bout Tomorrow night, in a temporary 24,000-seat outdoor arena constructed by Caesars Palace Hotel, Leonard will be risking his World Boxing Council welterweight championship against Hearns's World Boxing Association championship. In the divided world of international boxing, this is the first unification of titles since Duran knocked out Esteban DeJesus Jan. 21,1978, to consolidate the lightweight championship. But unification will probably not last long in the 147-pound division. The winner can be expected to relinquish the title, again giving the sanctioning bodies a chance to choose individual champions. Leonard and Hearns have heavier goals than the undisputed welterweight title. If Leonard wins, he may have to give up the W.B.A. portion if he wants to retain his W.B.A. junior middleweight title. And he wants to keep that W.B.A. title so he can unify the 154-pound championship against Wilfred Benitez, the W.B.C. champion. Eventually, Leonard wants to meet Marvin Hagler, until tomorrow the world's only undisputed champion, for the middleweight title. Hearns has already said this will be his last welterweight bout. It is getting harder and harder to keep his weight at 147 pounds. His goal is not only to win the junior middleweight and middleweight titles, but also to eventually go after the light-heavyweight (175-pound limit) championship. Dundee an Edge for Leonard Tomorrow night, as Leonard matches his superior speed and quickness against Hearns's superior reach and power, Leonard also will have a decided edge in his corner, where Angelo Dundee, who has handled nine world champions, directs traffic. Although Emanuel Steward, Hearns's trainer and manager, already has had two world champions in less than four years, he is not considered on Dundee's level as a strategist. The prefight strategies are set. Leonard, with a 73-inch reach, is expected to try to get inside Hearns's 78 1 2-inch reach. Steward is expected to have Hearns fight defensively, moving backward even, to keep Leonard a long-arm's length away. Steward has shown he can map strategy but has not yet proved he can change tactics if necessary. For example, when Hilmer Kenty was losing his W.B.A. lightweight title to Sean O'Gr ady last March, Steward kept telling Kenty to ''stick and m ove,'' although his fighter clearly could not move. Also, Dundee has a reputation as one of the best cut men in the business; Steward does not. Corner Chaos ''Sometimes the corner is complete chaos,'' said a boxing teammate of Hearns from Steward's Kronk Gymnasium in Detroit, who did not wish to be identified. One time, the fighter said, Mickey Goodwin, the sixth-ranked W.B.A. middleweight, wound up with part of the red beard of Don Thibodeaux in his mouth between rounds. Thibodeaux is a sculptor who is Hearns's assistant trainer. ''It was so funny,'' the fighter said. ''They put in Mickey's mouthpiece and some of Thibo's hair got caught in it. Poor Mickey. He spent the whole round trying to get hair out of his mouth. You ever try to remove hair from your mouth with boxing gloves on?'' Dundee has refused to claim an advantage over Steward. He still can joke about the time he kept yelling at Muhammad Ali to ''get off the ropes, get off the ropes,'' when Ali upset George Foreman in Zaire - by letting Foreman wear himself out punching him on the ropes. ''It's not as if Manny and I were going into the ring to fight,'' Dundee said. ''Them guys on the stools are what counts.'' Before the sun goes down for the Leonard-Hearns bout, scheduled to start at 7:30 local time, which will be 10:30 in New York, some other fine young fighters will be on the preliminary card. Perhaps the two best teenagers in the world - Edwin Rosario, a Puerto Rican junior lightweight, and Tony Ayala Jr., a junior middleweight from San Antonio - are on the card, as well as two heavyweight prospects, Marvis Frazier and Tony Tucker. Rosario,18, has won all 19 pro fights by knockout. He will warm up for a shot later in the year at Sammy Serrano's W.B.A. 130-pound title by meeting James Martinez, a veteran with a three-bout losing streak. But Martinez's losses were all by decisions and he has not been stopped by some top boxers. He could take Rosario the distance. Ayala, also 18 and undefeated, meets lesser opposition in the former Mexican welterweight champion, Jose Baquedano. Frazier fights Guy (The Rock) Casale and Tucker meets the veteran Harvey Steichen. Davey Pearl was named referee for the Leonard-Hearns bout at Tuesday night's rules meeting. The three judges, who will do the scoring, will be named Wednesday by the Nevada State Athletic Commission with the accord of both the W.B.C. and W.B.A. The judges will be American and at least two will be from Nevada. The three-knockdown rule - in which a fighter dropped three times in a round loses automatically - has been waived. The mandatory eight-count will be in effect and a fighter can not be saved by the bell except in the 15th round. Scoring will be on the 10-point system. Illustrations: Photo of Tommy Hearns  ",

   "input": "With the growing interest in the use of plant extracts both in medicine and in cosmetics, ''botanicals'' is a word that one is probably going to hear often from now on. Scientists speak of botanicals when discussing their search for new cancer-fighting drugs, contraceptive agents, insecticides, sugar substitutes and painkillers. Cosmetics chemists speak of botanicals in conjunction with new formulations for cleansers, moisturizers, hand creams, bath products, hair rinses and shampoos. Botanicals are any type of plant extract that serves a pharmacologic or cosmetic purpose, and the history of their use spans thousands of years - from the herb healing of the ancients to some of the most sophisticated drugs prescribed today. Folk remedies from many cultures are still providing botanists with leads in their search for flowers, leaves, stems and roots that yield valuable ingredients. Yet the vast potential of botanicals has hardly been tapped. According to Dr. Norman R. Farnsworth, head of the department of pharmacognosy and pharmacology at the University of Illinois at the Medical Center, only about 1 percent of the approximately 750,000 different species of higher plants on the face of the earth have been seriously investigated. Nevertheless, he says, the range of present-day uses is considerable. On the medical side, between $4 billion and $5 billion worth of prescription drugs of plant origin is sold annually in the United States (this is equivalent to about one prescription in four). An indication of what may lie ahead: The National Cancer Institute, working with the United States Department of Agriculture, is examining some 5,000 extracts each year, with a total of 35,000 plants screened to date. One of the prize finds has been the Madagascar periwinkle, whose tiny white or rose blossoms have been used for centuries in Asian medicine to treat everything from toothaches to dysentery. From this plant, two major cancer-treatment drugs, vincristine and vinblastine, have been derived. Meanwhile, cosmetics chemists are working with a fascinating array of botanicals to meet all kinds of everyday beauty needs. The list includes chamomile, wild pansies, marigolds, lavender, meadow sweet, cornflowers, hawthorn blossoms, gentian, broom, white nettles, marjoram, sage, horse chestnut, ivy, juniper, hops and mint, to name a few. Much of the impetus for the use of botanicals in medicine and cosmetics comes from abroad. Certainly, when it comes to cosmetics, the European influence is clear. During the past 10 years, plant ingredients have been used increasingly in France, Italy, West Germany and England. And while there is no dearth of such imported cosmetics on the American market, the current crop is nothing compared with what is expected in the near future. One of the most practical cosmetic uses of botanicals is in colorrinse shampoos. Take the Klorane collection, developed by a French country pharmacist, Robert Rolland, which Macy's and Bloomingdale's are now starting to stock. A chamomile shampoo from the collection puts sunny lights in blond or light-brown hair. A shampoo made with walnut leaves helps brighten dull brown hair. A henna shampoo does as much for fading redheads, and a cornflower shampoo takes the yellow out of white, the brassiness out of blond. Another French shampoo, which acts as a blue rinse on the hair, is Orchidee Bleue, imported by Caswell-Massey Pharmacy in New York. Louis Licari, a hair-color expert at La Coupe in New York, uses it to wash blond hair a shade ashier. To wash in more blond color, he favors chamomile also, but here his choice is not French but English - a shampoo made by Molton Brown of London and sold at Cambridge Chemists on Madison Avenue. Chamomile, a mainstay of botanical cosmetics, is used in many skincare products, too. Nowhere is its versatility more apparent than in the collection that Clarins, a leading French firm, is introducing at Bloomingdale's, Saks Fifth Avenue and Henri Bendel this week. Chamomile is present in close to a dozen different Clarins herbal blends, which are formulated to help cleanse, soften, soothe and moisturize the skin. One very ancient European way with botanicals is the aromatic bath. It was a daily ritual among the Greeks and most conspicuously indulged in by the Romans, who carried the custom throughout Europe and all the way to Bath. Soon a host of bathing preparations will be available in this country. Among the first arrivals will be Kneipp Bath Botanics, which are expected any day now at Saks Fifth Avenue, Bloomingdale's and Macy's. This set of six herbal solutions is said to have originated with Father Sebastian Kneipp, a parish priest who lived in the Bavarian village of Bad Worishofen during the latter part of the 19th century. The ingredients in the herbal solutions, and the effects attributed to them, are: rosemary to wake up the body, juniper to relieve sore muscles, chamomile to soothe the skin, pine and spruce to lift the spirits, meadow blossom to relax at day's end and hops to induce sleep. While many European plant-extract products do go back in time, botanical cosmetics are so popular today that many companies are engaged in innovative experiments. Pablo Manzoni, formerly the creative director at Elizabeth Arden who is starting his own line of cosmetics, has a newly patented process for extracting juice from plants that will be used for cosmetics. He reports that the process makes it possible to put more than 75 percent natural liquid content in lotions and more than 50 percent in creams. He is using this new technique for a line of skin-care products which he will be bringing out in this country later in the year.  ",

   "input": "PEKING, March 27 2014 Mao Dun, a writer who said literature should not be an ''intoxication'' but whose ideology-laced works showed a psychological penetration, died today, the official news agency Xinhua reported. He was 85 years old. Mr. Mao was best known for his 1933 novel ''Midnight,'' an indictment of Shanghai's newly emerging industrialists. The book also told of peasant uprisings, labor strikes and rural depression. Mr. Mao was cultural minister from 1949 to 1965 and like many in the arts, was criticized during the Cultural Revolution of the late 1960's. In recent years, he was president of the Chinese Writers Association and editor of Chinese Literature, a magazine. Mao Dun was a pen name. He was born Shen Yen-ping. Xinhua reported last month that Mr. Mao's ''Ordeal,'' which he wrote more than 30 years ago in Hong Kong, was about to be published for the first time. Mr. Mao wrote in the preface that he intended to write a five-volume novel giving a comprehensive description of major political and economic events in China. He had finished the first volume when he heeded a Communist Party call to take a post here, according to Xinhua. In 1919, Mr. Mao and others founded a society encouraging realistic literature and opposing ''art for art's sake.'' In 1930, he joined the Chinese League of Left-Wing Writers. During China's war against Japan and the civil war, he was regarded as a major figure in the leftist arts movement in areas under the control of the Kuomintang. Mr. Mao once wrote: ''Literature is not intended to provide relief for those who suffer from the ennui of life, but it performs a positive function of stimulating the human mind. Especially in our age, we hope it will aim to shoulder the heavy responsibility of awakening the masses and giving them strength.'' His writings also depicted the mental agitation of Chinese intellectuals as revolutionary ideas developed and the inability of the peasants to ''get out from under'' their burden of toil and debt.

   "input": "MADRID, Oct. 27 2014 Almost one year old, the 35-nation East-West conference on detente and human rights resumed here today after a summer break with expressions of gloom about the outcome. Since it opened last November, the conference has labored to review and advance the 1975 Helsinki accords. Western diplomats acknowledge that little progress has been made, and several delegates are pessimistic that an agreement can be reached by the proposed closing date of Dec. 18. With the member countries of the Warsaw Pact and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization disputing the convening of a follow-on session on disarmament, diplomats are already exploring ways of ending this conference while keeping alive the idea of detente. Speaking today on behalf of the 10 members of the Common Market, John Wilberforce of Britain chastised the Soviet Union for its military intervention in Afghanistan, a crackdown on human rights activists, the jamming of Western radio broadcasts and failure to give adequate notification of military maneuvers around Poland. Afghans Called Opposed to Soviet ''The people of Afghanistan continue to make clear their opposition to the Soviet-created regime by fighting or fleeing in ever increasing numbers,'' he declared. ''There are now some 2.4 million refugees in Pakistan, with at least 400,000 in Iran. This is the largest concentration of refugees in the world.'' Mr. Wilberforce endorsed a Canadian proposal for a follow-up meeting on human rights, which the signers of the Helsinki accords are pleged to respect. He accused the Soviet Union of cutting off the flow of emigration, and said that Jewish emigration this year was down to 73 percent of last year's level. Leonid F. Ilyichev of the Soviet Union called attacks on his country's human rights record ''cheap propaganda'' and said that recent pacifist marches in Western European capitals were a sign that ''the spirit of detente is still alive.'' Mr. Wilberforce retorted that implementation of the Helsinki accords would give Soviet citizens the opportunity to demonstrate, too. The pacifist movement has begun to cause concern among Western delegations. ''I suppose it will make the Russians less likely to negotiate, won't it?'' one delegate said. ''They've got a good thing going, and I suppose they will try to keep it that way.'' West Is Seeking to Avoid Blame Most Western delegates believe that the conference has been a propaganda defeat for the Soviet Union, and they are now eager to avoid blame if the gathering were to fail to reach any solid accords. Divergent Eastern and Western conceptions of the proposed followup conference on disarmament, which would strengthen so-called confidence-building measures to lessen the chances of a surprise military assault, remain the main stumbling block to an agreement. The West wants a firm agenda, while the Soviet Union seems to envision a more open-ended gathering. When the Madrid gathering adjourned on July 28, the two sides disagreed over the territorial zone that should be discussed. After the Russians had agreed to include the Soviet Union's European part, up to the Ural Mountains, Max M. Kampelman of the United States offered to include American troop movements across the Atlantic to Europe. But Mr. Ilyichev said today that another Western concession was required. So far, the position of the United States and its allies is that no further concessions are possible.  ",

   "input": "ANKARA, Turkey, June 3 2014 A Turkish military court ordered former Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit freed from prison today, but he still faces two separate charges and possible jail sentences. Although the military prosecutor declared that Mr. Ecevit should be released for lack of evidence, he was not acquitted as had been widely expected. The presiding judge announced that Mr. Ecevit would be set free but that his trial would be resumed on June 29. The former Prime Minister is accused of damaging Turkey's reputation abroad, a charge that carries a possible five-year jail sentence. Mr. Ecevit, a Social Democrat and the most outspoken critic of Turkey's military regime, was arrested on April 10 for an alleged interview published in the Norwegian newspaper Arbeiderbladet that was considered injurious to the military regime. Denying that he had given any statement to the Oslo newspaper, Mr. Ecevit said, ''I have been kept under arrest for almost two months for statements that I have not made and words I have not said.'' Cites Editorials Abroad He said more damage had been done to Turkey's reputation abroad by his jailing than by any statement by him. He cited editorials protesting his arrest that appeared in American and other newspapers. The defense centered on a statement obtained from the author of the incriminating article, a Danish journalist named Jan Stage, who said that Mr. Ecevit had refused to give him an interview and that the article was based on other sources. Legal experts believed that Mr. Ecevit would be acquitted in this case once the courts receive official translations of the Arbeiderbladet article and the author's declaration and verification by a Danish court. But Mr. Ecevit still faces other charges of violating the regime's ban on political statements, for which he could get from six months to two years in prison. On Friday Mr. Ecevit must appear before another military court because of alleged declarations to the German weekly Der Spiegel and to Dutch television. He is charged with having criticized the political restrictions under the military regime.  ",

A total of 2,748 portraits from a record 92 countries were submitted 2013 a striking increase on the 2,377 from 71 countries last year and the most that have been received in the prize 2019s 36-year history. Organisers said the increase was down to new rules that allow people to submit images of their portraits digitally. The shortlist includes a portrait award regular in the shape of Michael Gaskell, an artist based in Leicester, who has been runner-up three times and selected for the exhibition five times. This year, he was shortlisted for a portrait of his niece Eliza, who sat for him in early 2014 aged 14. Gaskell said he first painted Eliza when she was a young child but that remains unfinished. 201cI hope this painting conveys a sense of Eliza 2019s growing confidence as she develops into a woman but retains some of the self-consciousness which was also present at the time, 201d he said. In its lighting and composition the painting is influenced, Gaskell said, by the 15th-century Dutch painter Hans Memling. Matan Ben-Cnaan, from the north of Israel, was shortlisted for his portrait, Annabelle and Guy. On the face of it, the painting is a seated man with his daughter and a large dog. But Ben-Cnaan said it was an allegorical portrait inspired by the biblical story of Jephthah, who led the Israelites into war with the Ammonites and vowed to God that, if he won, he would sacrifice the first thing he saw on his homecoming. He expected it to be a dog. Unfortunately it was his daughter. 201cThe tension imminent in the moment of realisation of the horrible price one must pay is reflected in the composition, 201d he said. 201cHer [Annabelle 2019s] strong posture reflects her own resolve and her role, in both the biblical story and in Guy 2019s life, in carrying his burdens and misfortune. 201d The third shortlisted artist is Borja Buces Renard, who divides his life and work between Madrid and Florida. His painting is My Mother and My Brother on a Sunday Evening, which has added poignancy because of who is not in it. Renard said he painted his mother Paloma and his brother Jaime on what was a regular Sunday family get-together but his father was absent due to illness. He died a few weeks later. The weekly event was slowly disappearing, said the artist. 201cI wanted to portray this emotion in my painting with the image of my father missing and that difficult time for all of us, especially for my mum, who had dedicated herself to taking care of him. 201d Pim Baxter, the museum 2019s deputy director and chair of judges, said: 201cIt was good to see even more international artists entering and my fellow judges and I were impressed by the different styles of portraiture, some quite new to the exhibition, and intrigued by the stories behind the portraits. 201d The judging panel this year comprises Pim Baxter, deputy director of National Portrait Gallery, historian Simon Schama, curator Sarah Howgate, artist Peter Monkman, Kim Mawhinney, head of art at National Museums Northern Ireland, and Des Violaris, the director of UK arts and culture for BP. An exhibition of 55 portraits will go on display at the National Portrait Gallery in London between 18 June and 20 September with the 00a330, 000 winner named in June.  ",

We are 15 years into this new century. Fifteen years that dawned with terror touching our shores; that unfolded with a new generation fighting two long and costly wars; that saw a vicious recession spread across our nation and the world , he said. It has been , and still is, a hard time for many. But tonight, we turn the page. The shadow of crisis has passed , and the State of the Union is strong, Obama said , claiming credit for ending the recession. He heralded the growing economy , shrinking deficits, bustling industry, and booming energy production that have also helped revive his political fortunes as his time in the White House nears its end. Mr Obama signs a tie after delivering his speech. (AAP) Appealing to Democrats determined to retain the White House in 2016 , Obama called for an increase in the minimum wage, equal pay for women and tax breaks for the middle class. Drawing a stark contrast with tax-averse Republicans, he dared his foes to oppose proposed tax hikes for the rich that would pay for middle class breaks. We have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth. It's now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next fifteen years , and for decades to come. Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well? Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort? he asked. Obama's Republican opponents have branded such talk as little more than class warfare and will use their majority in both houses of Congress to make sure the plans never become law. Republican Senator Joni Ernst , who was tasked with rebutting Obama's speech, said Americans are still suffering from stagnant wages and lost jobs. Republican Senator Joni Ernst was tasked with rebutting Mr Obama's speech.

Obama also redoubled calls to end the half-century-old embargo on Cuba and vowed to veto any move to put further sanctions on Iran. Our shift in Cuba policy has the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere , he said. US President Barack Obama shakes hands with his Cuban counterpart Raul Castro at Nelson Mandela's memorial in December 2013. (Getty) On Iran , Obama warned any move to impose new sanctions could scupper delicate negotiations aimed at reaching a complex nuclear deal. New sanctions passed by this Congress , at this moment in time, will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails , he said. That is why I will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this progress. Obama also used the speech to call on Congress to authorise the use of force against the Islamic State jihadist group. The conflict against ISIL was also mentioned. (AAP) In Iraq and Syria , American leadership - including our military power - is stopping ISIL's advance. This effort will take time. It will require focus. But we will succeed.

The BBC has apologised for any offence caused by the inaccurate tweet, which was picked up by a number of foreign news outlets, according to reports. Another tweet wrongly claimed that the Queen was being treated in hospital and generated speculation on social media about the state of the monarch's health. The tweets were posted on the day the corporation held a technical rehearsal for its future coverage of the Queen's obituary but the BBC stressed that tweeting was not part of the exercise. By coincidence , the Queen was at hospital earlier today for her routine annual medical check-up. Buckingham Palace took the unusual step of confirming the private medical visit after concerns were raised about her wellbeing following the tweets. Ahmen Khawaja is a journalist with the BBC. The messages were posted on Twitter from the account of BBC broadcast journalist Ahmen Khawaja, and it is understood she will now face disciplinary proceedings. One tweet said: 'Queen Elizabrth has died (sic). Another tweet said: Breaking: Queen Elizabeth is being treated at King Edward VII Hospital in London. Statement due shortly.

   "input": "TheMonday rally was stronger than most traders expected. Whenever this happens, it pays to take a look at the trading action and try to determine what hypothesis best fits the facts. China: gaps up, ends near high Germany: gaps up, ends at high U.S.: gaps up, highs for day Hmm, there's a pattern here, and it's clearly global in nature. Comments from the People's Bank of China official that China has room to act in combating deflation and slow economic growth is yet another sign that some type of stimulus is coming. And confidence indexes were strong in Europe , indicating that the ECB is having some kind of influence on investor attitudes. Here in the U.S., three or four healthcare deals don't hurt, neither does much better than expected February pending home sales. But still, is that it? I think there's another crucial factor: it's the end of the quarter, with a lot of outperformance and underperformance. Just look at the performance spread between some of the S&P sectors: This is for just one quarter, not a full year. I look at the trading in the U.S. in the last week, and it sure seems like some people are moving some stocks around...buying losers (energy, some industrials) and lightening up on the winners (biotech). It makes perfect sense to buy underperformers going into the end of the quarter, particularly if you think they have put in some kind of bottom. This drop in energy stocks is the classic buy-the-dip. Traders simply refuse to believe that oil will remain in the $40s for any length of time. There have been attempts to buy dips in energy ETFs like the S&P Oil & Gas Exploration ETF, where we saw volume spurts when oil dropped in January and mid-March. Here's another seasonal factor: April starts on Wednesday, historically the best month for the Dow, up 1.9 percent on average since 1950, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac. One final observation: traders have been waiting for this mythical 10 percent correction for several years, and it still seems a ways off, despite lower earnings and a Fed poised to raise rates sometime this year. I do anticipate that the Fed tightening will have a dampening effect on stock multiples (the S&P is currently at roughly 17 times forward earnings, a bit high), but if it's just one rate hike this year, is that going to tank the market? Not likely. Instead, choppy trading is the most likely path, flat for the year. And if rate hikes are going to be slow and moderate, and economic growth is steady buy subdued, why not go back and focus on dividend payers, like everyone did last year? My biggest worry remains the down earnings projections for Q1 and Q2. But, let's assume this is a washout year for earnings. If that's true, it's perfectly reasonable to expect sloppy sideways trading. But once companies start increasing earnings projections next year, guess what happens? Anyone for a late-year rally?  ",

Richard Gere is not one of those people, but he plays one in Oren Moverman 2019s 201cTime Out of Mind. 201d Yes, there is a problem with glamorous movie stars slumming down to stretch their acting range and earn hoped-for Oscar attention. And homeless people do not have other stars popping in for cameos, like Steve Buscemi playing a mean building manager or Kyra Sedgwick as a bag lady with a cart full of cans. But this is no exercise in miserabilism. Instead Moverman and Gere take a problem and elevate it into a universal experience, turning social issues into existential insights. Gere 2019s immersive performance as a New York City vagrant and Moverman 2019s deceptively simple, pseudo-verite style, plus a scene-stealing turn by Ben Vereen, make 201cTime 201d pass rewardingly.

He watches from afar his estranged daughter (Jena Malone), then approaches her and is rejected, more than once.

Then Dixon vanishes. 201cPeople are just gone sometimes, 201d Hammond mutters. 201cIt doesn 2019t make sense. 201d Shot from afar or through windows, or in reflections of windows, Hammond melts into his surroundings, its noises, its traffic, its disdaining crowds.

It's an all-time high for a yearly total. It's an unprecedented situation , he said. This is just a slap in the face that we need to be more careful entering the sea. Even with this year's unusually high number of attacks in the Carolinas , in context, there are more pressing dangers at the beach than sharks, Burgess said. The world saw only three known shark-attack fatalities in 2014. The last fatal shark attack in South Carolina was in 1852. Burgess added that the number shark attacks is directly related to the number of people in the water. It's sort of a back-handed compliment to the chambers of commerce who are bringing that many people into the waters , he said. The next step is development of beach safety personnel and services to reduce the risk of shark attacks on their beaches that are now drawing so many people.

Six and a half million people spent their time visiting North Carolina beaches in 2014, according to a survey from the organization. This year's tourism season has yet to take a hit from the shark attacks, said Lee Nettles, executive director of the Outer Banks Visitors' Bureau. Nettles said his office has seen an increased number of concerned calls from visitors, but that people aren't canceling their trips.

China's President Xi Jinping told the 10, 000 people gathered at the ceremony of the 77th anniversary of the Nanjing Massacre (atrocities committed by Japan's occupying forces in 1937) last December that China should not bear hatred against an entire nation just because a small minority of militarists launched aggressive wars. Japan knows the conditions of a rapprochement with its crucially important trade partner. China also knows that improved relations with Japan and a compromise on territorial claims would calm down similar disputes with its other Asian neighbors. Hostile inter-Korean relations are another obstacle on the way to a stronger economic development in Northeast Asia. China and Japan could help with contacts between Seoul and Pyongyang. China , in particular, could use its strong trade and investment ties with Seoul and its special relationship with Pyongyang to reduce tensions between estranged Korean cousins. That will be tough , though. But it does seem that Koreans want to talk about a broad range of economic, social and security matters. Snarled up by overlapping territorial claims along their 3,500-kilometer frontier, the Chinese-Indian relations also looked hostile and crisis-prone until both countries agreed to move on. Who would have thought, for example, that instead of trading bullets and military incursions into contested areas, the Chinese and Indian border guards would be holding together a New Year party last week? That unexpected bonhomie is an interesting sequel to the Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to India last September. Sporting an impeccably tailored white kurta, Mr. Xi celebrated Indian Prime Minister Modi's 64th birthday in Ahmadabad, the capital city of the state of Gujarat, where his host earlier served as chief minister. The key points of a Sino-Indian deal involve a settlement of border problems and China's large infrastructure investments 2013 about $20 billion only in Indian railways. These investments would partly compensate for China's trade surplus with India, which amounted to $36.2 billion in India's fiscal year 2013-14. Both issues are under active consideration. China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi announced during his visit to Delhi in early June of last year that Beijing was ready to settle border issues 2013 a signal that China was eager to open up big investment and trade flows with India. China's broadening economic transactions with the rest of Asia form a strong regional investment platform. Political and security problems in Southeast Asia and on the Korean Peninsula are serious obstacles to a faster economic development, but there are important moves currently under way in both areas that should be watched.

His companies are also under investigation by several federal authorities, the publication reported. Realty Capital Securities 2019s main business is selling non-traded real estate securities to financial advisers, the article said.

We had this sort of lesbian relationship and it felt so great. It felt so good and yet I thought , 'There's something about this,' and this is before the thing I knew about my mother. I thought, 'No, this is something that's not really what I want.' It was very brief. Vanderbilt revealed that she was 13 at the time of the relationship , and said she now realizes, I think almost everybody goes through at one point 00e2 0080 00a6 of course , the thing is, now we realize there's no difference. Love is love. Vanderbilt said her understanding of homosexuality was largely shaped by the public gossip surrounding her own mother , Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt. Cooper, who in 2012, explained that during a 1932 custody trial Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt was accused of being a lesbian. That word wasn't spoken. The press wasn't supposed to write about it , Cooper said. My mom knew that something terrible had come out in the court , but she didn't know what it was and she didn't know what being a lesbian meant at the time, obviously. Donald Trump on the cover of PEOPLE Added Vanderbilt , Then of course , when I heard what it meant, it affected me so much because I thought this is something so terrible. This is like a terrible brand, like a terrible stamp. Is it something that maybe I have inherited? That was very difficult for me growing up to try to figure it out. It seems time has shaped Vanderbilt's understanding , however, as she said, It has nothing to do with whether it's two men or two women , it's love. And it's just like being married, it's what it is. Cooper and Vanderbilt's relationship will be featured in an and , before that, in a memoir, , due out April 5.  ",

   "input": "Most athletes want to keep their scholarships, but the demands of high-level college athletics can be challenging. Some students will end up transferring to other schools where they feel they'll be under less pressure or get more playing time, or both. In men's basketball (which has unusually high transfer rates), 14.5 percent of NCAA Division 1 players in 2012 20132013 were transfers from 2 2013year colleges and 13.3 percent came from 4 2013year schools. Among female basketball players, 7.5 percent of Division 1 players were transfers from 2-year schools and 8.6 percent from four-year colleges. Even for those who are committed to sticking with their teams, the amount of time required of them can be tough to manage. Nicole Sung-Jereczek started rowing in high school, having competed as a gymnast through middle school, and found she loved the sport and the close teamwork. When she became a rower at UCLA after being recruited with a scholarship covering about three 2013fourths of her costs, many things about the team exceeded her expectations. I didn't expect to have such great bonds with my teammates , she said. She was also surprised at how much the athletic department at UCLA worked to help me succeed academically and athletically , providing trainers , tutors, and more. Even so, Sung-Jereczek said, the college commitment was formidable. I didn't expect or anticipate the amount of time that I would have to devote to it , she said , of her time spent rowing at UCLA. Her commitment meant she couldn't get a part-time job or internship, she said, and severely limited her social life. I didn't expect or anticipate that I would only be rowing or studying. Plenty of athletes share that experience. In a survey of college athletes by the NCAA asking what students wished they could have changed about their college sports experience , the most common responses were about time. Another NCAA survey found that a typical NCAA athlete in-season spends 39 hours a week on academics 2014and 33 hours a week on sports. Sung-Jereczek graduated from UCLA last spring, having rowed all four years on a scholarship that she said covered roughly three-fourths of her college costs. But she estimated that roughly 30 percent of the people she started with in her freshman year did not stay on the team that long 2014even in a sport where teammates are unusually reliant on each other. She's proud that she rowed through college, and she managed to land a job at a sports management company after graduation. But Sung-Jereczek said she definitely thought about quitting along the way. It's something my teammates and I always struggled with , she said , what with bus rides to the marina at 5:30 in the morning, 20 hours of practice every week, and frequent travel to races and competitions. It's really hard for people to stick with it. Her sister is rowing at UCLA now , Sung-Jereczek said, and wants to row all four years. She's determined to , but you never know what happens.  ",

   "input": "How do we help kids succeed in school? It 2019s a question that plenty of college administrators have been asking themselves lately. For all of the rejiggering of admissions policies to admit more poor and minority kids, a good portion of them don 2019t seem to graduate. The black college graduation rate, for instance, is 42%, 20 points lower than the white one. No doubt some underprivileged kids are simply underqualified. But what if it is not just their academic bona fides that make a difference? For several years now, the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, an engineering school in Indiana, has been administering a test to its freshman that measures how much these students feel they are in control of their futures. It asks them to what extent they agree with statements like: 201cGrades most often reflect the effort you put into classes. 201d Or 201cI have largely determined my own career goals. 201d Or, on the other hand, do they believe 201cThere are some subjects in which I could never do well 201d and 201cI sometimes feel that there is nothing I can do to improve my situation 201d? The school tracked grades and retention rates, and found a clear correlation between higher locus of control attitudes and successful academic performance, Jim Goecker, vice president for enrollment management and strategic communications, told the website Inside Higher Ed. Which makes you wonder 2014 what messages make young people feel as if they are in control of their future? Well here 2019s what doesn 2019t: The constant chatter about institutional racism and sexism that pervade our educational institutions and media outlets. If you want to give a kid the sense that he has some modicum of control over his destiny, that his efforts will be rewarded with success, it 2019s probably best not to tell him the decks are stacked against him. We don 2019t have to pretend racism doesn 2019t exist, but race is not destiny. But that 2019s exactly what we do. Ebony Magazine recently published an article by a white man married to a black woman called 201cI Hope My Son Stays White. 201d In it, the author lays out the bleak future for his 3-year-old son if his skin gets darker. 201cI want my son 2019s skin color not to matter, but the truth is that it does 2026There will be consequences for him. People will fear him. Not everyone, but plenty of people, and he 2019ll never know who until it 2019s too late. It will only be worse if he wears a hoodie and sags his jeans 2026 201d The author imagines cops harassing his son for jaywalking, convenience store owners following him around, women watching him in fear. It 2019s hard to think of anyone but a 19th century slave-holder believing that race is destiny as much as this guy does. But of course he 2019s not alone. Take Jennifer Cramblett, the Ohio woman suing a sperm bank for accidentally giving her the sperm of a black man instead of the white one should had picked out. She and her lesbian partner want the sperm bank to pay millions of dollars for her to move to a new town, one she believes will be more hospitable to her mixed-race child. Mind you, Cramblett has offered no evidence of any difficulties she has experienced so far, but she believes that her daughter will suffer all sorts of undefined abuse from strangers and even her own extended family as a result of her skin color. Racism is going to doom her child 2019s chances for a happy life. 201cThis isn 2019t LA or New York. We 2019re not on the coasts. We 2019re in farm country, 201d Cramblett said. Oh, well, in that case the girl 2019s obviously in for a lifetime of bullying. Cramblett 2019s case is no doubt more about money than anything else. (And it 2019s odd to think that these farm country folks would be fine with lesbians have a baby, but draw the line at them having a mixed race baby). But ultimately she is offering her child the message that her family and community will never accept her, that they have to leave town to get away from the racism embedded in the culture. This is not about viewing the world with rose-colored glasses. But this is not 1950. We don 2019t have to pretend racism doesn 2019t exist, but race is not destiny. Telling kids that it is, though, may be a self-fulfilling prophesy.  ",

   "input": "When the U.S. Marine Corps deployed the unmanned K-MAX helicopter to Afghanistan in 2011, the cargo-hauling aircraft was only scheduled to stick around for a six-month trial. But, the Marines loved it so much they kept two K-MAX choppers in service for nearly three years, moving roughly 4.5 million pounds of gear, in dangerous or low-visibility conditions. While the Marines 2019 K-MAX helos is now in storage awaiting its next mission, a commercial version of the helicopter could soon hit the market. K-MAX maker Kaman Aerospace KAMAN has announced it is reopening its K-MAX production line more than ten years after producing the last aircraft. The company 2019s first aircraft to roll off the line will be a single-seat version piloted by humans. Although, a commercial offering of the unmanned, drone version isn 2019t likely too far behind, a Kaman representative says. The company 2019s first customers 2014which could emerge as soon as early 2016 2014will likely be contractors that help battle wildfires like the ones ravaging the U.S. West Coast. In 2015, Kaman conducted an aerial firefighting demonstration for the Department of the Interior in upstate New York. Later this year, the company plans to host another demo near Boise, Idaho, to prove the platform 2019s effectiveness in a different set of terrain conditions. If that goes well, the first commercial sales of unmanned K-MAX helicopters likely won 2019t be far behind. The popular aircraft has been around since 1999, but the unmanned variation of the cargo-hauler didn 2019t really come into its own until Kaman partnered with defense contractor Lockheed Martin LMT in 2007. Kaman provided the vehicle while Lockheed contributed its deep expertise in avionics and autonomous systems to produce a full-sized drone helicopter. The high-performing aircraft is capable of carrying up to 6,000 pounds via sling loads suspended from the aircraft 2019s belly. During the time K-MAX was developed, U.S. supply convoys in Afghanistan and Iraq had become regular and vulnerable targets for insurgent ambushes. As a result, the Marine Corps took an interest in military-grade helicopters, like the K-MAX, that could bypass roads altogether. Once in Afghanistan, the helicopter proved a reliable platform, completing its mission 94% of the time, says Terry Fogarty, general manager of the UAS product group at Kaman Aerospace. Unhindered by the need for visibility, the autonomous K-MAX could operate all night long and in weather conditions that would ground most human pilots. The Marines loved it so much they didn 2019t want to let it go when its six-month demonstration was complete, and instead kept two helos in service until the Marine Corps mission wound down in 2014. 201cReally the only reason those aircraft came home is because the Marine Corps. came home, 201d Fogarty says. Meanwhile, demand for the conventional K-MAX has been building in the market for a few years, Fogarty says. Kaman originally decided to close the K-MAX production line more than a decade prior for purely economic reasons when orders from its primary customers in the forestry industry slowed. But over the past two years demand for a cargo hauler with a low operating cost has reemerged, convincing the firm to reboot production. The company already has deposits in hand from two customers, Rotex Helicopter AG based in Liechtenstein and Atlanta-based Helicopter Express, for manned versions of aircraft. However, the company 2019s unmanned K-MAX helicopter hasn 2019t gone unnoticed. either At last year 2019s AUVSI convention 2014one of the robotics industry 2019s biggest global trade shows 2014the Department of the Interior approached KAMAN about turning the K-MAX platform into an unmanned aerial firefighter. For firefighting operations 2014as in war zone logistics 2014the K-MAX 2019s appeal is obvious, Fogarty says. Manned aerial firefighting operations can only operate for roughly 8 hours a day, when daylight visibility is at its greatest. A robotic K-MAX could operate around the clock in the most dangerous areas without putting human pilots at risk. It could also open the door to further commercial sales of the unmanned K-MAX to customers in other tough industries. For instance, logging, oil and gas industries 2014or any other enterprise that requires moving equipment in austere environments where manned aviation is either too dangerous or expensive 2014could find great use for the aircraft. Kaman has yet to ink a commercial contract for an unmanned version of K-MAX, but interest in the robotic platform continues to grow. At the Paris Air Show last month several firefighting authorities from around the globe approached Kaman about the prospect of a commercially available K-MAX, Fogarty says. Moreover, those currently buying manned versions of K-MAX also retain the option of upgrading to the unmanned platform down the road. 201cReally what reopened production was the demand for the commercial manned version, but we can take a manned K-MAX, put a kit in it, and make it unmanned, 201d Fogarty says. 201cSo it 2019s appealing to these guys as they 2019re looking to the future. 201d That 2019s a strong selling point for customers unsure about investing in large unmanned platforms like K-MAX, while the Federal Aviation Administration decide on regulations governing those type of vehicles. 201cThe FAA has spent a lot of time on unmanned aircraft that are 55 pounds and under, but at some point they 2019ll address unmanned aircraft that are the size of a K-MAX, 201d Fogarty says. When that happens, the ongoing transition of sophisticated, autonomous drone technology from realm of national defense to the world of commercial operations won 2019t just apply to small camera-equipped drones but to full-sized utility aircraft as well. The market for unmanned aircraft that can do more than simply collect data is potentially vast, Fogarty says, and a stamp of approval from the U.S. Marine Corps certainly doesn 2019t hurt K-MAX 2019s marketability. 201cThe Marine Corps has deployed this technology to actually do things, 201d he says. 201cAnd we 2019re going to build off their example whether it 2019s carrying water or cargo or anything else. 201d  ",

Mr. Spathe always read us stories at the end of the school day. He kept us mesmerized, illustrating every detail and movement with his voice and his gestures, helping the story come alive. I then became an avid reader. Reading books brought the pages to life for me as I traveled the world or visited other centuries. When I was in the sixth grade I wrote my first book; The Little People. It was never published, but I wrote it with feeling and enthusiasm. As I got older I realized that writers love to read, so I continued to read everything I could find because it helped me learn to write how people felt, talked or acted. When I think back on that time and how my teacher inspired me on the road to writing, I've always wished I could thank him. Teachers have a great influence on children whether they realize it or not; but when they inspire that child to do something they love, that student never forgets the teacher's inspiration. Since my own children have grown, I've written many books -- some rejected and some still in the works. I write because I love words. (Without Mr. Spathe instilling in me the love for words, reading would be just another chore.) Now I read to my grandchildren all the time. It forms a bond that they'll never forget, and hopefully they too will have a love for the written word. -- See the average salary for a writer.

Alan Moore created V , the avenging hero of the comic book and graphic novel V for Vendetta (drawn by David Lloyd) , which has been adapted into a movie. Alan Moore's series V for Vandetta depicts a totalitarian British dystopia. THE most vivid characters in Alan Moore's graphic novels are antiheroes of ambiguous morality and identity: costumed avengers like Rorschach , the disturbed street vigilante of Watchmen , or the crusader known only by the letter V , who commits catastrophic acts of terrorism in the dystopian tale V for Vendetta. With inventions like these , and a body of writing that spans nearly three decades, Mr. Moore, a 52-year-old native of Northampton, England, distinguished himself as a darkly philosophical voice in the medium of comic books 0097 a rare talent whose work can sell solely on the strength of his name. But if Mr. Moore had his way today, his name would no longer appear on almost any of the graphic novels with which he is most closely associated. I don't want anything more to do with these works , he said in a recent telephone interview , because they were stolen from me 0097 knowingly stolen from me. In Mr. Moore's account of his career , the villains are clearly defined: they are the mainstream comics industry 0097 particularly DC Comics, the American publisher of Watchmen and V for Vendetta 0097 which he believes has hijacked the properties he created , and the American film business, which has distorted his writing beyond recognition. To him, the movie adaptation of V for Vendetta , which opens on Friday , is not the biggest platform yet for his ideas: it is further proof that Hollywood should be avoided at all costs. I've read the screenplay , Mr. Moore said. It's rubbish. Mr. Moore has never been shy about expressing himself. With Watchmen , a multilayered epic from 1986-87 (illustrated by Dave Gibbons) about a team of superheroes in an era of rampant crime and nuclear paranoia 0097 and again with V for Vendetta (illustrated by David Lloyd) , published in America in 1988-89, about an enigmatic freedom fighter opposing a totalitarian British regime 0097 Mr. Moore helped prove that graphic novels could be a vehicle for sophisticated storytelling. Alan was one of the first writers of our generation , of great courage and great literary skill, said Paul Levitz , the president and publisher of DC Comics. You could watch him stretching the boundaries of the medium. But by 1989 , Mr. Moore had severed his ties with DC. The publisher says he objected to its decision to label its adult-themed comics (including some of his own) as Suggested for Mature Readers. Mr. Moore says he was objecting to language in his contracts that would give him back the rights to Watchmen and V for Vendetta when they went out of print 0097 language that he says turned out to be meaningless , because DC never intended to stop reprinting either book. I said , 'Fair enough, ' he recalls. 'You have managed to successfully swindle me , and so I will never work for you again.' Mr. Levitz said that such so-called reversion clauses routinely appear in comic book contracts , and that DC has honored all of its obligations to Mr. Moore. I don't think Alan was dissatisfied at the time , Mr. Levitz said. I think he was dissatisfied several years later. Mr. Lloyd , the illustrator of V for Vendetta , also found it difficult to sympathize with Mr. Moore's protests. When he and Mr. Moore sold their film rights to the graphic novel , Mr. Lloyd said: We didn't do it innocently. Neither myself nor Alan thought we were signing it over to a board of trustees who would look after it like it was the Dead Sea Scrolls. Mr. Moore recognizes that his senses of justice and proportion may seem overdeveloped. It is important to me that I should be able to do whatever I want , he said. I was kind of a selfish child , who always wanted things his way, and I've kind of taken that over into my relationship with the world. Today , he resides in the sort of home that every gothic adolescent dreams of, one furnished with a library of rare books, antique gold-adorned wands and a painting of the mystical Enochian tables used by Dr. John Dee, the court astrologer of Queen Elizabeth I. He shuns comic-book conventions, never travels outside England and is a firm believer in magic as a science of consciousness. I am what Harry Potter grew up into , he said , and it's not a pretty sight. Actually , he more closely resembles the boy-wizard's half-giant friend Hagrid, with his bushy, feral beard and intense gaze, but those closest to Mr. Moore say his intimidating exterior is deceptive. Because he looks like a wild man , people assume that he must be one, said the artist Melinda Gebbie , Mr. Moore's fianc 00e9e and longtime collaborator. He's frightening to people because he doesn't seem to take the carrot , and he's fighting to maintain an integrity that they don't understand. After he left DC Comics , he spent the 1990's working his way from one independent publisher to the next, ultimately arriving at Wildstorm Studios, owned by the comics artist Jim Lee. There, Mr. Moore was given his own imprint, called America's Best Comics, where he continued to write such pioneering and popular titles as The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen , about a proto-superhero team of Victorian literary characters including Allan Quatermain , Captain Nemo and the Invisible Man. DC Comics purchased Wildstorm, in 1998, expecting that Mr. Moore would not tolerate the arrangement. We did the deal on the assumption that Alan would be gone the day it was signed , said Mr. Levitz. But Mr. Moore's loyalty to his artists trumped his aversion to his former employers , and he stayed put. It seemed easier to bite the bullet meself , he said. In 2001 , the first film adaptation of one of Mr. Moore's graphic novels arrived in theaters. From Hell , distributed by 20th Century Fox , was based on his extensively researched account of the Jack the Ripper murders, a 572-page black-and-white title illustrated by Eddie Campbell. Mr. Moore had no creative participation in the film, and happily so. There was no way that I would be able to be fair to it , he said. I did not wish to be connected with it , and regarded it as something separate to my work. In retrospect, this was kind of a na 00efve attitude. Two years later , when 20th Century Fox released a movie version of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen , the screenwriter Larry Cohen and the producer Martin Poll sued the studio , charging that elements of the film had been plagiarized from their work. Though the film, which was one of the year's costliest flops, differed drastically from the graphic novel, the lawsuit nonetheless claimed that the Extraordinary Gentlemen comics had been created as a smokescreen to cover up the theft. Mr. Moore found the accusations deeply insulting , and the 10 hours of testimony he was compelled to give, via video link, even more so. If I had raped and murdered a schoolbus full of retarded children after selling them heroin , he said , I doubt that I would have been cross-examined for 10 hours. When the case was settled out of court , Mr. Moore took it as an especially bitter blow, believing that he had been denied the chance to exonerate himself. Since then, he has refused to allow any more movies to be made from work he controls. In the case of work whose rights he does not control, he has refused credits on any film adaptations, and has given his share of option money and royalties to the artists who illustrated the original comic books. That position is so radical that though his colleagues say they respect his position, few in the film industry can understand it. It's very simple , but they don't seem to hear it, said John O'Neill , the illustrator of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. They just gravitate towards offering more money. Last year , when Mr. Moore received a phone call from Larry Wachowski 0097 who, with his brother, Andy, had written and directed the Matrix movies 0097 to discuss the V for Vendetta film that the Wachowskis were writing and producing for Warner Brothers , Mr. Moore felt he had made it clear that he did not want to be involved in the project. I explained to him that I'd had some bad experiences in Hollywood , Mr. Moore said. I didn't want any input in it , didn't want to see it and didn't want to meet him to have coffee and talk about ideas for the film. But at a press conference on March 4 ,2005, to announce the start of production on the V for Vendetta film , the producer Joel Silver said Mr. Moore was very excited about what Larry had to say and Larry sent the script , so we hope to see him sometime before we're in the U.K. This , Mr. Moore said, was a flat lie. Given that I'd already published statements saying I wasn't interested in the film , it actually made me look duplicitous, he said. In a telephone interview , Mr. Silver said he had misconstrued a meeting he had with Mr. Moore and Dave Gibbons nearly 20 years ago, when Mr. Silver first acquired the film rights to Watchmen and V for Vendetta. (Mr. Silver no longer owns the rights to Watchmen , though Warner Brothers is still planning an adaptation.) I had a nice little lunch with them , he said , and Alan was odd , but he was enthusiastic and encouraging us to do this. I had foolishly thought that he would continue feeling that way today, not realizing that he wouldn't. Mr. Silver said he called Mr. Moore to apologize for his statement at the press conference , but that Mr. Moore was unmoved. He said to me , 'I'm going to hang up on you if you don't stop talking to me, ' Mr. Silver recalled. It was like a conversation with a tape recording. Through his editors at DC Comics (like Warner Brothers , a subsidiary of Time Warner), Mr. Moore insisted that the studio publicly retract Mr. Silver's remarks. When no retraction was made, Mr. Moore once again quit his association with DC (and Wildstorm along with it), and demanded that his name be removed from the V for Vendetta film , as well as from any of his work that DC might reprint in the future. The producers of V for Vendetta reluctantly agreed to strip Mr. Moore's name from the film's credits , a move that saddened Mr. Lloyd, who still endorses the film. Alan and I were like Laurel and Hardy when we worked on that , Mr. Lloyd said. We clicked. I felt bad about not seeing a credit for that team preserved , but there you go. DC , however, said it would be inappropriate to take Mr. Moore's name off of any of his works. This isn't an adaptation of the work , it's not a derivative work, it's not a work that's been changed in any fashion from how he was happy with it a minute ago, said Mr. Levitz. Still , some DC editors hope that Mr. Moore might return. He remains a good friend , and I would work with him again in a heartbeat, said Karen Berger , the executive editor of the DC imprint Vertigo, in an e-mail statement. But Mr. Moore does not seem likely to change his mind this time. For one thing, his schedule is almost entirely consumed with other comics projects, including a new volume of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen , to be released in late 2006 or early 2007 by the American publisher Top Shelf Productions. This summer , Mr. Moore said, Top Shelf will also be publishing Lost Girls , his 16-years-in-the-making collaboration with Ms. Gebbie , a series of unrepentantly pornographic adventures told by the grown-up incarnations of Wendy Darling of Peter Pan , Alice of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Dorothy Gale of The Wizard of Oz. I refuse to call it erotica , because that just sounds like pornography for people who've got more money, Mr. Moore said. It would seem to be possible to come up with a kind of pornography that was meaningful and beautiful , not ugly. Ms. Gebbie said she was more excited to see Mr. Moore finish his novel Jerusalem , another years-long project that he estimates will total 750 pages when complete. It's his story , his heritage, his blood ties and his amazing, wonderful system of beliefs, Ms. Gebbie said. This book for him is an unfolding of his real , deep self. But Mr. Moore suggested that his comic-book writing has already defined his identity. He recalled an encounter with a fan who asked him to sign a horrific issue of his 1980's comic The Saga of the Swamp Thing; the admirer then disclosed that he was a special effects designer for the television series CSI: NY. Every time you've got an ice pick going into someone's brain , and the close-ups of the little spurting ruptured blood vessels, and that horrible squishing sound, that's him, Mr. Moore said. So that's something I can be proud of. This is my legacy. Correction: Mar. 19 ,2006, Sunday: An article last Sunday about the graphic novelist Alan Moore misstated the given name of the illustrator of Mr. Moore's book The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.

   "input": "As a technology reporter in San Francisco, I listen to executives pitch their startups all the time, and only rarely do I hear one that really scares me. But hearing about HomeSuite set off my alarm bell. The young startup, which revealed last week that it had raised $2.3 million in funding and has been operating around San Francisco for several months, made me nervous as a San Francisco resident who has neither deep pockets nor an appetite to move into a new furnished apartment every few months. These are arguably the two requisites for using the service, which bills itself as making short-term, furnished apartment rentals more efficient. While both serve short-term guests, HomeSuite is different from home-sharing service Airbnb. HomeSuite is a licensed real estate broker that works directly 2014 and only 2014 with landlords. It connects them with tenants who would otherwise turn to other services like Craigslist and Zillow, for a cut of up to 10% of the monthly rent. Airbnb, in contrast, claims it simply connects hosts with guests. It has no broker license that would let it represent a party or facilitate a real estate transaction. Airbnb also happens to be facing strong backlash in San Francisco because it reduces the number of long-term rentals available. Pressure grew so strong that San Francisco passed an ordinance last year that limits hosts to renting homes for no more than 90 days annually (unless they live there while renting out rooms), along with requiring them to register with the city and pay occupancy taxes. I 2019ll be honest: the idea behind HomeSuite sent shivers down my spine when I first read the pitch. San Francisco is in a housing crisis that has raised rents into the stratosphere. An apartment shortage and big tech salaries are partly to blame. People with more modest paychecks are being priced out. At first glance, I 2019m not sure that sites like HomeSuite are making it easier for well-heeled San Francisco residents to apartment hop and for landlords to get premium rents will help the situation. In fact, it sounds like the service could make it worse. Imagine if units used for long-term rentals were converted to short-term, furnished apartments that only cater to wealthy residents. This is an extreme scenario, but it 2019s not unreasonable to think it will happen. Even without HomeSuite, apartment evictions have been on the rise since 2010, according to city data. Long-time residents are being displaced by high rents and transient tenants who have more money. And yes, regulatory obstacles are blocking landlords from building enough new units to keep up with the demand. But HomeSuite co-founder and CEO David Adams doesn 2019t think his service could exacerbate the problem. 201cThis market isn 2019t for everyone, 201d Adams said of the kind of landlords working with his service. In fact, only about 2% to 5% of housing falls into the short-term rental category, he said. Currently, around 2,000 units spread across 900 properties are listed on HomeSuite, said Adams, who declined to share any details about the company 2019s revenue. Adams said he founded the company because he wanted a better way to find and rent fully furnished apartments for a few months at a time. HomeSuite, he insists, will make that part of the market better organized and help renters like him who don 2019t want traditional long-term rentals. With HomeSuite, short-term renters will have an easier way to find landlords who are expressly catering to them. That 2019s why Adams believes his service could actually help the housing crunch as it would lead to some units intended for long-term housing being freed up because short term tenants have alternatives. The short-term rental market does about $60 billion in business globally, according to Adams. That 2019s more than big enough to create a successful business, he says. 201cMy motivation isn 2019t to take over the world, my motivation is to solve my problem, 201d Adams said. I 2019m just hoping Adams 2019 version of the future is the one we end up with, not the potentially catastrophic one I fear could emerge. Next up, HomeSuite wants to expand to Los Angeles, and eventually New York City, among other tough real estate markets. The company 2019s new funding comes from Battery Ventures, Foundation Capital, and Bessemer Venture Partners, among others.  ",

   "input": "Actor Paul Walker suffered horrific burns and multiple injuries in the 100-mph Porsche crash that killed him and a pal, autopsy reports released Friday show. Neither Walker, nor the man behind the wheel 2014 his business partner Roger Rodas 2014 had drugs or alcohol in their systems, according to reports obtained by the Daily News. Nearly all of Walker 2019s body was charred through the skin, and his hair color and eye color could not be determined upon visual examination, the gruesome report stated. Officials said the 40-year-old actor was found in a 201cpugilistic stance 201d with right wrist and left arm fractures, indicating he had braced for impact. The report also said Walker sustained jaw, collarbone, rib and pelvic fractures and had 201cscant soot 201d in his trachea, suggesting he at least partially inhaled some of the smoke. The beloved 201cFast & Furious 201d actor died Nov. 30 as he was riding in Rodas 2019 2005 Porsche Carrera GT near a charity toy drive at their Valencia, Calif., sports car dealership. The autopsy report said Rodas also suffered burns over his entire body, but he died from blunt head, neck and chest trauma 2014 not the fire. The married father of two suffered massive head trauma, with his skull opened widely due to fractures and his brain exposed. He did not have soot in his airway , the report said. Both men died almost instantly. According to the reports, police at the crash scene believed Rodas,38, was driving approximately 100 mph or faster when he lost control for unknown reasons. He was driving eastbound on a clean, well-lit and deserted street. A sheriff 2019s deputy told investigators the Porsche partially spun and began traveling in a southeast direction until it struck a curb and drove onto an embankment. The driver 2019s side hit a tree and a light post before spinning 180 degrees, hitting another tree on the passenger side and bursting into flames, the report said. There were 201ccurved skid marks 201d that led from one eastbound lane into another eastbound lane and onto the south side embankment, the report said. The Porsche was found with all four of its wheels almost split in half. There was a slight curve in the road west of the incident, but the stretch where the collision occurred was relatively straight, law enforcement officials said. The report was released on the same day two men pleaded not guilty to stealing a roof panel off the wrecked Porsche. Jameson Witty,18, and Anthony Janow,25, appeared in a Los Angeles County courtroom Friday and agreed to return Feb. 25 to set a date for their preliminary hearing. They declined to speak with reporters outside court and face up to four years and six months behind bars if convicted on all counts. The men were charged last month with felony grand theft and two misdemeanor counts each of destroying evidence and resisting, obstructing or delaying a peace officer.  ",

   "input": "Seems like these days travelers have no qualms about stuffing their luggage with a few souvenirs from their hotel room. And it's not just the towels: If it's not bolted down, it will walk. Scratch that: Even if it bolted down, it will still walk. Hotel managers report seeing flat screen televisions and even large pieces of art leave the premises, freshly unscrewed from walls by determined guests. Not to mention door hinges, showerheads, and even luggage stands.So what's the big deal? It all adds up to $100 millions worth of items every year. While hotels don't expect you to clean them out, there are plenty of goodies you can take home guilt-free. Here is our list of what to take -- and what to leave behind lest you incur the wrath of a replacement charge. Hotels Heists There have been plenty of strange items liberated over the years. Here are some true tales, including confessions from some sticky-fingered travelers. 2022Emily McFarlane of San Jose recounts being pursued around The Fairmont in San Francisco after relieving the coat check sign of its initial letter C. We ran all over the hotel while being pursued by men in blazers shouting , Madam , the 'c!' Give us the 'c!' 2022A Geneva lawyer admits being caught by the receptionist of a Hamburg hotel having trouble pressing the elevator buttons while attempting to make off with an entire display of apples in a rather large fruit bowl from the hotel lobby. 2022I was in a private suite for a party and after a few drinks I decided I couldn't part with the softness of the terrycloth robe , David Wallace of Toronto confesses. I exited the hotel wearing the robe in full view of my hosts and hotel staff. The doorman merely smiled as he held the front door open for me. 2022Once a ping pong table by the pool went missing for three days , reports Nicola Amos of L.A.'s Chateau Marmont. They finally found it in the back yard of Bungalow 3. 2022A huge piece of blown glass by Dale Chihuly was once stolen from a table in the lobby , laments Jenne Neptune of The Alexis in Seattle. 2022According to Bill Babis of 70 Park Avenue , the most outrageous things stolen from the chic hotel were the thermostats. 2022Somebody actually bothered to tear out Michigan , Illinois, Connecticut, and New York from a rather expensive and comprehensive driving atlas we had available for all guests to consult, says Richard Maloney from Rundles-Morris House in Stratford , Ontario. 2022I have seen both a bed from an exterior corridor hotel and a TV go missing! says Mark Shouger , G.M. of Chicago's The Wit. 2022London's May Fair Hotel was once the victim of a catnapping when an ornamental cat went missing from the Amba Bar. A brief investigation ensued and within 12 hours of leaving the hotel the guest received a telephone call , says Mara Begley. Twenty-four hours later , the cat was returned by courier. Stationery? That's all yours -- especially if it is branded with the hotel's name , website, and phone number. It's basically free publicity for the hotel every time you whip out their pen. They also really want you to send those postcards. The Alexis Hotel in Seattle even lets you paint your own as extra incentive to let those at home know that you wish they were there. Towels are the number one item to make their way into travelers' luggage. Holiday Inn alone estimated that they lost 560,000 towels in one year -- and that's just one chain. Duvets, pillows, sheets, and pillowcases also disappear at an alarming rate. But seriously, how big must your suitcase be to fit an entire bed's worth of linens? Perfectly sized to meet the 3-ounce rule, these are yours for the taking whether you've opened them or not. Some hotels even go an extra step to make it easy to bring those toiletries home. Rundles Morris House in Stratford, Ontario, provides decorative plastic covers for packing their full-size bars of Roger & Gallet soap. Who hasn't snagged the plastic laundry bag out of the closet to pack still-wet bathing suits or cushion a duty-free bottle of rum? That's fine, but if the hotel uses cloth or canvas bags, beware the charge. Some hotels now attach tags to them to warn travelers the price in case they go missing. Basically if the hotel can reuse it, they don't want you to take it. Forget pillow mints. Chicago's Wit Hotel leaves mini Rubik's cubes, light bulb-shaped stress balls, or old school paddle ball games at turndown, and you should feel no guilt taking them to play with on the plane ride home. And a welcome basket of treats is usually fair game if it comes with a note from the staff. Still scared that in-room gift will lead to a surprise on the final bill? When in doubt, call the front desk and check before popping the cork. It's safe to assume that the room's iHome sounds system should not be checking out with you. The most outrageous thing to disappear from one of our rooms was a stereo , says Michael Green of Palm Spring's Triangle Inn. And because it was in a closed cabinet we did not realize it immediately. Linda Chin , G.M. of Boston's Onyx Hotel, takes a Zen approach. You can take anything you want from the room , she says , but we'll charge your credit card for replacement. It can be confusing , but while most hotels automatically bill you if the robe goes missing, some of the most luxurious hotels won't charge for the robe, slippers, or even that laundry bag if you decide to slip them in your suitcase (they prefer keeping your business rather than trifling over a hundred dollars). New York's Hotel Gansevoort even includes items such as monogrammed robes, branded eco-totes, books, and bottles of premium liquor as part of packages. But you better really want that robe, since those complimentary extras come at a price: Package rates are often twice as much as regular room rates. So you're headed out for a day of sightseeing and realize that the AAs in your camera are dying. Which is just the kind in the back of the remote.... Stop right there and find the closest drugstore instead. Sure , they're disposables , but they're supposed to run out at the hotel , not in your Wii controls. Light bulbs have also become a tempting snag as hotels start to upgrade to energy-saving compact fluorescent bulbs that cost a little more upfront. Bibles have long been an expected amenity in hotel bedside tables. Even though they are slowly being edged out, Gideon International still places more than ten million copies of the good book in hotel rooms annually to replace those that have disappeared or are worn out. Needless to say the society is thrilled when you break the eighth commandment and take one home with you. As awesome as the story would be if you could boast about staging a Bond-esque operation to relieve a hotel of some art, not everyone will be as charmed. But sometimes the story has a happy ending for all involved. The inebriated guest who helped himself to a boar's head at Hotel Du Vin in Birmingham, England, didn't have to pay for the pig, his friends did. After the sheepish former guest returned the item, friends went back and bought the boar as a wedding present.  ",

Or was Thomas the victim of a 201chigh tech lynching, 201d as he memorably claimed? 201cConfirmation 2019s 201d creative team 2014including Kerry Washington, who plays Anita Hill and also served as executive producer 2014contends they weren 2019t taking sides in the HBO film, which debuted on Saturday. But many conservatives who rallied around Thomas 2019 nomination see the film as unfair, leaving out all of the contradictions that, they say, raised questions about Hill 2019s credibility. Indeed, one of the top trending articles on The Wall Street Journal 2019s website Monday is an op-ed entitled, 201cThe Hollywood Hit-Job on Justice Clarence Thomas. 201d Fortune reached out to Jill Abramson, who quite literally wrote the book on the subject, or at least co-wrote it. Abramson and Jane Mayer, both then-fellow Wall Street Journal reporters, spent three years pouring over records and interviewing hundreds for their 1994 book, Strange Justice: The Selling of Clarence Thomas, which concluded 201cthe truth in this matter favors her much more than was apparent at the time of the hearings. 201d Abramson and Mayer were attacked by Thomas 2019 supporters when the book came out, but Strange Justice was nominated for a National Book Award, as it revealed evidence that corroborated pieces of Hill 2019s account. So what does Abramson, a former executive editor of the New York Times who now teaches at Harvard University, think of the film and the legacy of the hearings? What 2019s your reaction to 201cConfirmation 201d? I reviewed the script for accuracy and did so without pay. I think the film is accurate. It portrays what I thought was the most memorable, and in some ways, awful parts of the hearing. Republicans set out to destroy this citizen and her credibility. There is something that always strikes me as awful when the full power of the U.S. government is turned on a private citizen, in this case, a law professor from Oklahoma. The movie remains studiously neutral of who was telling truth. But Jane Mayer and I, in three years of reporting, found the weight of it proving Hill to be the truth teller. The reason we wrote the book was because we weren 2019t satisfied with the fact that all of the leaders at the time were saying that it was 2018he-said, she-said 2019, that you could never get to the truth. We found that wasn 2019t the case. Vice President Joe Biden, then chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, is portrayed in the film as pliant and weak. Was he? He was cowed by the Republicans. The decision not to hear from other witnesses (who were prepared to corroborate some of what Hill said) in some ways left Anita Hill very isolated. And the fact that Biden allowed Clarence Thomas to testify first and again that night gave him an advantage. Does this episode of history really have any relevance today? Yes, it has a lot of relevance. The legacy of the election was more women were voted into office 201428 to Congress in 1992 and six to Senate. They called themselves the 2018Anita Hill 2019 class. Many of them are still in office. In some ways, those hearings were a national education on sexual harassment. A lot of people were not familiar with the term or what constituted sexual harassment. Lawmakers thought there had to be touching in order for it to be harassment, which is not the case. It 2019s unfortunate that sexual harassment continues to be a problem in this country. Unfortunately with the polarization of the Congress, the attack machine is still employed in a strategic way by Republicans and Democrats. One of the unfortunate legacies is that Congressional hearings are even less of a fact-finding exercise. They 2019re political show trials much of time, used to try to destroy anyone hostile to their agenda. The Benghazi hearing. There was so much grandstanding, their purpose 2026was to drive down Hillary 2019s polls. I think in both cases, it was an abuse of the power of the lawmakers..[an attempt] to make villains out of the female witnesses. In your column for the Guardian, you wrote that Washington 201chas rarely been a place that respected women 2019s words, or their authority. 201d Do you think these partisan attacks only happen to women? Oh no. These hearings are supposed to be fact-finding efforts but they 2019ve become opposition wars. It happens to both genders because it 2019s become a partisan tool. The interview was edited for clarity and space.  ",

Left unmentioned during the 19-minute hearing was anything that transpired between the drinking of the vodka and the dumping of the drunken girl. Special prosecutor Jean Peters Baker, who was appointed to pursue the case after allegations of political favoritism were lodged against the local prosecutor, explained afterward that she filed 201cno sex charges 201d because 201cin this case there was insufficient evidence to go forward with a sex charge. 201d Coleman and her mother Melinda Coleman expressed their satisfaction with outcome in statements released by their Kansas City attorney. 201cToday, I am grateful that the defendant took responsibility by pleading guilty to the charges. I am ready to move forward, 201d said Coleman, now 16. 201cTo all those who supported me, I promise that what happened on January 8,2012, will not define me forever. 201d Though the Coleman family has been open about the victim 2019s identity 2014maintaining Facebook and Twitter accounts while giving numerous interviews with media outlets around the world 2014prosecutor Baker declined to name her in charging documents and asked a throng of reporters outside the Nodaway County Courthouse to treat her as though she were anonymous. 201cI implore the media: give this young victim an opportunity to heal, to start a new narrative for herself, 201d Baker said. According to a written statement by Sergeant Roger Philips of the Missouri Highway Patrol, the old narrative started with Coleman and a 13-year-old friend drinking at home while texting Barnett, who soon arranged to meet the girls and take them to a little party in his basement. After creeping through the window to avoid waking Barnett 2019s parents upstairs, the girls joined four older boys. 201cAfter drinking the vodka, 201d Philips wrote, Coleman 201cdid not recall any subsequent events. 2026 The next thing she remembered was waking up in her yard. 201d One of the boys had sex with the younger girl and was ultimately prosecuted in juvenile court. But Nodaway County Prosecutor Robert Rice declined to bring charges of any kind against Barnett or another boy, who allegedly used a smartphone to record a sexual encounter between Barnett and Coleman. When radio and newspaper reporters in Kansas City dug into the case, they noted that Barnett is the grandson of former Missouri state representative Rex Barnett, an influential Republican. This hint of political favoritism 2014and certain parallels in the case to an earlier controversy in Steubenville, Ohio 2014led the internet hactivist network known as Anonymous to launch a campaign in October to reopen the matter. Baker, a Democrat from Kansas City, said Thursday that she had gone through all the evidence in the case and discussed the facts extensively with the both the victim and the accused. Although she lacked sufficient evidence to sustain sexual assault charges, Baker said, she did use the threat of felony endangerment charges to persuade the defense to accept a plea bargain. Under terms imposed by Missouri Circuit Judge Glen Dietrich, Barnett was sentenced to four months in jail 2014but the sentence was suspended in favor of two years probation. During that time, Barnett must avoid alcohol, undergo substance abuse counseling and routing drug testing, and have no contact with Coleman or her family. He must perform 100 hours of community service and pay restitution of $1,800 to provide counseling services for the victim. Barnett also delivered an apology to his victim via the prosecution team. Baker judged the young man 2019s statement to be 201cgenuine, 201d and said she would convey his words to the Colemans 201cat the appropriate time. 201d 201cMatthew Barnett accepts full responsibility and he truly regrets his actions, 201d defense attorney J.R. Hobbs said after the hearing. He added that 201ctwo skilled prosecutors 201d have now concluded that felony sex charges 201care not appropriate in this matter. Further, there is absolutely no evidence that political favoritism played a role in the decision of either prosecutor. 201d The Kansas City Star reported earlier this week that Daisy Coleman had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital following a suicide attempt that her mother linked to continuing harassment on social media. Prosecutor Baker declined to comment on that, and nothing in the girl 2019s written statement 2014or her mother 2019s 2014alluded to a recent crisis. Both women instead spoke hopefully of fresh beginnings. As prosecutor Baker ended her press conference on the snow-covered steps of the red-brick Victorian courthouse, a nearby bank sign registered a temperature of 23 degrees. Though warmer than the lows spread earlier in the week by the polar vortex, this was a biting, bitter cold on the windswept hilltops of Maryville. Two years and a day ago was equally cold: a low of 21 on the night a helpless girl was dumped in shirtsleeves by a heedless boy. The case is now closed, but the thought of it merits a shiver.  ",

   "input": "As the president of a university, I would like to take strong exception to the suggested revisions in the teaching of history being considered by a committee of the New York State Education Department (news story April 18). Many things are said against the quality of education in American secondary schools, and they are often true. Many students can't write, do not know any foreign language and are lacking in even elementary quantitative skills. However, the single biggest deficiency we find in otherwise very good high school students coming to very good colleges is that they have no sense of history, no understanding of events and ideas as connected in time or place. Without a student's knowledge of the facts and chronology of historical events - world, regional and national - it is almost impossible to teach in any meaningful fashion not just specific periods in history but any other subject: literature, philosophy, music and art, let alone the history of mathematics and natural and social science. It is like trying to teach physiology without first teaching anatomy: There is no conceptual skeleton on which to hang the information. If dates and facts are not taught in secondary school, the deficiency is not made up in college. Students can meet the general requirement for history courses, for example, by taking ''The Development of Property Law in Tudor England,'' ''The Russian Revolution, Part 2,'' ''Chinese Nationalism from the Boxer Rebellion to Mao'' or ''The Status of Women in Africa during the Imperialist Period.'' All this leaves them with no concept of how periods relate to each other in time and place; they can leave college with no idea of whether Joan of Arc came before or after Queen Elizabeth I, or how the Industrial Revolution correlated with changes in the social order. I am heartily in favor of putting greater emphasis on the history of other civilizations, but not by de-emphasizing our own. We are unlikely to be able to continue to live in this small world without blowing it up unless East and West, North and South understand each other better. But whatever the ethnic background of our students, as inheritors of Western culture they also urgently need a better understanding of our civilization. The history of Asia, Africa and Latin America should be integrated into world history and taught in conjunction with the history of the Western world, not instead of it. What students really need to be well prepared for college is four years of American and world history in high school. It should be taught chronologically, so that they can tell what was happening at least in the Western world in each century during the last three thousand years. As Winston Churchill once noted, if we do not know where we come from, we are unlikely to have a sense of where we are going.

Putin played that trump card again Thursday, warning European leaders that the Kremlin would cut natural gas supplies to Ukraine if it did not pay up on a $2.2 billion gas debt to its former Soviet master. In a letter to the leaders of 18 countries, Putin demanded payment after Kiev failed to meet a Monday deadline for its March gas bill. Read More Putin: Ukraine debt threatens Europe gas supplies The gas shut-off notice was not an idle threat: State-controlled Gazprom stopped pumping gas to Ukraine during disputes in the winters of 2005-2006 and 2008-2009, crimping the flow to Europe. Still, the Russian economy is already feeling the pain from Ukraine 2014even without economic sanctions. Earlier this week, Russia's Economy Ministry predicted that GDP growth could slow to around 0.5 percent 2014from 1.3 percent last year. In February, Russia's gross domestic product eked out growth of just 0.3 percent year over year, up from a revised 0.1 percent in January, the ministry's Andrei Klepach told reporters. If it continues, the Ukraine crisis could send Russia's economy into reverse, according to a report last month by the World Bank, which forecast a 1.8 percent contraction in its worst-case scenario. Russian officials have disputed that assessment. There won't be a recession , but there is a problem of stagnation: it's length and depth, Klepach said. Unfortunately the investment slump is continuing. I'm not ready to say how long it will continue. To add to the pain of the slowdown , the Ukrainian crisis has battered the value of the ruble, as foreigners scramble to get out of investments based in the currency. That's raised import prices, fueling a surge in inflation. The Economy Ministry predicted annual price inflation of 7.0 percent in March, up from 6.2 percent in February. Read More Russia will be at G20, Ukraine to be discussed - Australian treasurer To defend the ruble, Russia's central bank recently boosted interest rates by 1.5 percentage points, further tightening credit at a time when the local economy can ill afford it. With roughly half a billion in gold and foreign reserves, the central bank still has some leeway in defending the ruble. But a deeper currency crisis can't be ruled out if the country continues to bleed capital. Last month, citing the Ukraine crisis, falling investment and persistent capital outflows , Fitch Ratings cut the outlook on Russia's triple-B credit rating to negative and reduced its growth forecast to less than 1 percent for 2014.

   "input": "Who 2019s the new John Hughes? The question has been bobbing around since the mid-2000s, when Mean Girls reminded us, following the rise of the American Pie films and their imitators, that the teen-movie genre had more to offer than nostalgia, bad behaviour and moderate nudity. Since then, a handful of great films have emerged about what it means to be beached on the bank between childhood and adulthood 2013 Jason Reitman 2019s Juno, Greg Mottola 2019s Superbad and Adventureland, Will Gluck 2019s Easy A, and Drew Barrymore 2019s Whip It foremost among them. But they 2019re all the work of people dipping a toe into the genre before moving on 2013 whereas Hughes committed himself, over a four-year period in the mid-Eighties, to articulating what it meant to be teenage more acutely than any single writer or director had done before or has since. Which is why it 2019s tempting to say our John Hughes is nobody else than John Hughes: still is; always will be. Between 1984 and 1987, Hughes wrote six teen movies: Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, Weird Science, Ferris Bueller 2019s Day Off, Pretty in Pink and Some Kind of Wonderful. The first four of those he also directed; the other two were by Howard Deutch, although behind-the-scenes tales from Pretty in Pink suggest Hughes was still the primary guiding influence on set. Together, these six films make up just a fraction of his life 2019s work. Between his first screenplay, for 1982 2019s National Lampoon 2019s Class Reunion, and his death in 2009, Hughes directed eight features and had writing credits on 25 more, plus a handful of other projects that went direct to video or were made for television, and countless more that were left unmade. But those half-dozen high-school films are his legacy. Though they 2019re unmistakably set in the suburban, Midwestern America of the Eighties, with its deeply specific set of hormone-addled social anxieties, they feel as brightly relevant now as ever. That 2019s partly because, unlike many teen movies, their scripts aren 2019t filled with references to contemporary TV shows and trends. (A John Hughes film doesn 2019t have time to look sideways at pop culture: it 2019s too busy being it.) Instead, the humour is rooted in Hughes 2019s characters 2019 sarcasm-tipped speech patterns, which didn 2019t come from the playground but right out of their creator 2019s head. The only real school children who ever sounded like they were in a John Hughes film were trying to. And of course, thousands upon thousands did What sounded like slang in context was a language of Hughes 2019s own creation. 201cThis is a really volcanic ensemble you 2019re wearing, 201d says Duckie, the lovelorn best friend of Andie Walsh in Pretty in Pink 2013 perhaps the first recorded usage of the word 201cvolcanic 201d as a compliment. The only real schoolchildren who ever sounded like they were in a John Hughes film were trying to. And of course, thousands upon thousands did. Even the plaintive, synth-laden songs, which now seem completely inseparable from the Eighties high-school experience 2013 Simple Minds 2019 Don 2019t You (Forget About Me), Spandau Ballet 2019s True, OMD 2019s If You Leave 2013 crept into teenage culture via John Hughes films. American kids in the Eighties were listening to Michael Jackson, Madonna and hair metal. But Hughes, a devotee of British New Wave pop, conspired to give their lives a richer, more finely shaded soundtrack. More than all of the above, though, Hughes 2019s teen films haven 2019t dated for the same reason films by F W Murnau and Buster Keaton and Billy Wilder haven 2019t either: the astonishing quality of the work. Hughes 2019s entire output is explored in detail in an excellent new book by Kirk Honeycutt, John Hughes: a Life in Film 2013 and what strikes you more than anything is how much the film-maker 2019s own high-school experiences fed into his work. He spent his childhood in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, but his family moved to Northbrook, a well-to-do suburb of Chicago, when he was 12 years old. He entered his teenage years with a blank social slate, and had trouble filling it. The Hugheses were less well-off than many of the families in Northbrook, and John was sharply aware of the difference. He saw himself as an outsider, and took an interest in art, the Beatles and Bob Dylan. He grew his hair until it touched his collar. Teachers antagonised him 2013 it may have been a two-way thing, of course 2013 and he fostered deep-hewn grudges against a handful of them that would later surface in his scripts. A PE teacher who failed him in his senior year turned into Richard Vernon, the tyrannical vice-principal in The Breakfast Club. His own vice-principal, in turn, became the inspiration for Principal Ed Rooney in Ferris Bueller 2019s Day Off. Before filming began, Hughes took the actor Jeffrey Jones on a tour of his high school and made a point of introducing him to his old VP, who welcomed the men into his office in a sharp suit and with a holstered pistol fastened to his belt. That 2019s why you 2019re unlikely to find a Dead Poets Society, or a Mr Holland, beetling away behind the classroom doors in a John Hughes film. Hughesian teachers can be many things 2013 petty, sadistic, ineffectual 2013 but they 2019re never inspirational. Instead, the teenagers have to come to terms with growing older on their own. There 2019s no better way of summing it up than the quote from David Bowie 2019s Changes that opens The Breakfast Club. On a black screen, we see the following words in white type: 201c 2026And these children that you spit on as they try to change their worlds are immune to your consultations. They 2019re quite aware of what they 2019re going through 2026 201d Then the screen itself shatters, revealing the grey exterior of Shermer High School, where the film 2019s all-day detention is about to take place. Hughes never patronised his characters; he treated teenage trauma with gravity 201cYou see us as you want to see us, 201d runs the opening monologue 2013 which we later discover is part of the essay written by the five students from different backgrounds, played by Molly Ringwald, Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy, Judd Nelson and Anthony Michael Hall, who learn that they have more in common than they first thought. 201cIn the simplest terms and the most convenient definitions. You see us as a brain, an athlete, a basket case, a princess and a criminal. 201d Before Hughes, teen movies had almost exclusively trafficked in stereotypes 2013 the jock, the geek, the virgin, the stoner, the slut and so on 2013 and The Breakfast Club was his wholesale rejection of those worn-out tropes. Hughes establishes the differences between these five characters so nimbly you barely notice it happening: in their clothes; their parents 2019 parting words to them at the school gates; the different cars in which four of the five arrive; even where in the library they choose to sit. But as the detention runs its course, our easy assumptions about them are turned on their head. None of them fits the role into which they 2019ve been forced by high-school life. 201cWhat we 2019ve found out is that each one of us is a brain, and an athlete, and a basket case, a princess and a criminal, 201d runs the film 2019s closing monologue, which is shared by all five of the leads. This realisation is treated, rightly, as life-changing. Hughes never patronised his characters, and treated teenage traumas with far more gravity than those his adult characters suffered through. Even today, that feels revolutionary 2013 and shows Hughes 2019s commitment to treating his young audience with the utmost respect, however outlandish the on-screen action got. (Honeycutt writes that Hughes suspected most teen films, with their booze and drugs and shower-room nudity, were actually aimed at adult men.) It 2019s also the common feature of the great recent teen films listed above. Drew Barrymore told an interviewer that, while she was making Whip It, she was determined it would be 201ca teen movie, but 2026 like John Hughes 2019s movies, where it stars teens, and is about teen issues, but takes them seriously 201d. Will Gluck, when he was promoting Easy A, said he had tried to make 201ca movie that [Hughes] wouldn 2019t be embarrassed to watch 201d. It would be fascinating to know what Hughes would make of today 2019s teen-movie landscape, with young-adult fantasy and science fiction in the ascendancy, and straightforward high-school movies thin on the ground. One of the great strengths of a series such as The Hunger Games, and the reason it 2019s connected with millions of young cinemagoers around the world, is that it finds a way to turn the tribulations of modern teenage life into life-and-death drama. But the genius of Hughes is that he was able to do exactly the same thing in an overcast, present-day American suburb on a sub-$5 million budget. So perhaps to find today 2019s John Hughes we need to look elsewhere. The only recently successful young-adult film that doesn 2019t fit the sci-fi template is Josh Boone 2019s The Fault in Our Stars, starring Shailene Woodley as a high-school pupil with thyroid cancer and Ansel Elgort as the charismatic young hunk of boyfriend material she meets at a patients 2019 support group. The characters talk about novels and dream of visiting Europe 2013 and Elgort 2019s character has the Hughesian tic of keeping an unlit cigarette clamped between his teeth. 201cThey don 2019t kill you unless you light them, 201d he says, 201cAnd I 2019ve never lit one. It 2019s a metaphor, see? You put the killing thing right between your teeth, but you don 2019t give it the power to do its killing. 201d That dialogue came directly from the pen of John Green, who wrote the book on which the film 2019s script was (very closely) based. Just as Hughes did in the Eighties, Green credits his young characters with enough intelligence to play with ideas like this, and an appetite for unpicking life 2019s mysteries. He has an abiding sympathy and respect for them, which Green has found reflected back at him by his young readership. Green 2019s original novel of The Fault in Our Stars has sold 10.7 million copies since it was published in 2012. Along with his three other novels plus various side projects, it 2019s helped him amass a passionate fan base known as 201cnerdfighters 201d 2013 a term Hughes himself might have coined. If Hughes were around today, would we find him on YouTube, laughing and joking with the young cinemagoers who 2019d found encouragement and hope in his work? Or would this self-styled outsider remain off the grid with his wife and two sons in a quiet Chicagoan suburb? There 2019s no way to know 2013 and, of course, no need to either. His films speak for him, articulately and at length, whenever your inner teenager might want to hear a friendly voice.

Glen Audenaert, head of the Belgian judicial police, said officers carried out 16 raids in Brussels and one in the eastern city of Liege in the biggest anti-terrorism operation in the country's history. Four Belgian nationals had been in Pakistan and Afghanistan since late 2007 and two of them were placed under surveillance when they returned some months ago. A third, the suicide attack suspect, returned only last week. The other detainees, both men and women, were suspected of offering logistic and material support to the mission , providing accommodation, clothing and communication assistance. Mr Delmulle said: We don't know where the suicide attack was to take place. It could have been an operation in Pakistan or Afghanistan , but it can't be ruled out that Belgium or Europe could have been the target. The investigation began in December last year when investigators made 14 arrests in connection with an alleged attempt to spring the Tunisian , Niza Trabelsi from jail in Belgium, although no one was charged. Trabelsi, a former professional footballer, was the handler for British shoe bombers Richard Reid and Saajid Badat and was arrested with the ingredients to make the explosive TATP.

In the contemporary reality of illegal abortion, the woman and the provider are often one and the same. According to public health experts, a hundred thousand women have covertly tried to ended their pregnancies themselves in Texas alone, and legal abortion clinics closing across the country may make matters worse. RELATED: Women are already being prosecuted for having abortions What happened before Patel got to the hospital remains fiercely disputed, including how far along her pregnancy was and whether she delivered a stillbirth or a live baby. But both sides concede that Patel ordered pills from InternationalDrugMart.com, similar to ones doctors administer for early abortions, and took them alone in her room. There was no back-alley butcher or a doctor defying criminal sanction. When she showed up at the hospital bleeding, she and no one else was charged. Or as one of the prosecutors in Patel 2019s case succinctly put it in a hearing, 201cWhen she does the act, she is the performer. 201d Abortion is legal in Indiana. But in 2009, after the shooting of a pregnant bank teller, Indiana legislators decided to stiffen the penalties for causing the death of a gestating fetus. The bill 2019s sponsor touted support from both Planned Parenthood and Right to Life. It is that law that Indiana prosecutors now say gives them the right to charge Patel. Patel 2019s attorneys argue in her appeal that the law was intended to punish people who harm pregnant women, not the women themselves; attorneys for Indiana counter that there 2019s nothing in the law to stop them from prosecuting women. That 2019s what worries women 2019s health advocates and supporters of abortion rights, who have rallied to Patel 2019s side. 201cThese laws were meant to protect women, 201d said Miriam Yeung, executive director of the National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum, which filed a brief in Patel 2019s appeal. 201cAnd now they 2019ve turned around and sent Purvi Patel to jail. 201d At the trial in St. Joseph County 2014 home of the University of Notre Dame 2014 prosecutors told jurors a story of a cold and unfeeling woman who put herself first, lacking any maternal instinct. 201cThe defendant took care of herself while her baby laid dying, 201d prosecutor Aimee Herring told the jury in her opening statement. 201cOn July 13, a little boy was born on a cold, hard bathroom floor, 201d prosecutor Mark Roule said in his closing statement. 201cThe only touch he got from his mother was to move him from the bathroom floor to a garbage can. 201d Patel, Roule declared, 201cdecided to do what was easiest and most comfortable for her, even if it was not legal. 201d She waited until after a business trip to Chicago to take the pills she ordered, Roule said, because 201cit 2019s just not convenient so she decides to wait even longer to let the baby develop even more. 201d Roule even speculated Patel had avoided seeing a doctor because she feared being told she had passed Indiana 2019s 20-week limit and telling her parents she was pregnant. 201cThere is no do it yourself abortion, 201d Roule told jurors. 201cNot what is legal. 201d There were many mentions of all the dumpsters that had been searched until the body was found. The prosecution 2019s experts testified that Patel had likely given birth to a live baby who took a breath, who was at least 25 weeks and thus could have survived with prompt medical attention. The defense 2019s witness testified that the key expert had relied on a discredited test of whether the baby had breathed, and saw no evidence of a live birth. To Yeung, the portrayal of Patel in the trial and the media smacks of stereotype. 201cThere is a false narrative about Asian American women that we don 2019t care about our babies, 201d Yeung said. Even the repeated emphasis by prosecutors on Patel 2019s demeanor, Yeung contended, has 201ca racist context. Another stereotype of Asian Americans is that we 2019re inscrutable. 201d Her group 2019s brief notes that immigrant women in particular mistrust the medical system in part because of a history of abuses here or at home. Indiana previously prosecuted a Chinese immigrant, Bei Bei Shuai, for feticide. (Shuai pled guilty to a lesser charge and is now free.) Patel was born in the United States, but Yeung argued, 201cSeeing both Bei Bei and Purvi as un-American contributes to harsher sentencing. In countries where abortion is fully illegal , women have found other ways that don 2019t involve the proverbial coat hanger. One half of the pill regimen that doctors administer to end pregnancy, known as Misoprostol, is likely to induce miscarriage. (Patel stands accused of taking both halves of the regimen.) In Mexico, all it takes to get the pill is walking into a pharmacy, where it is sold as ulcer medication. An online network of guerrilla abortion-rights activists, Women on Web, mails misoprostol to women in countries where it is banned, along with instructions about how to end a pregnancy safely 2013 or at least, more safely than even more desperate means. Brazilian authorities recently seized almost all packages of abortion pills meant for pregnant women fearing the Zika virus there, who have no access to legal abortion. Still, Women on Web does not work in the United States, and its site exhorts that 201cwomen who live in a country where they have the possibility to have a safe and legal abortion, should go to a doctor. 201d Getting a legal abortion in Indiana means a required ultrasound and two separate visits to a clinic, possibly one surrounded by protesters. This year, after 30 years in business, the abortion clinic in South Bend, in the county where Patel lived, permanently closed. The same month, Governor Mike Pence, who made his name in Congress investigating Planned Parenthood, signed a host of new restrictions into law. They include regulations on abortion providers similar to the Texas law currently being considered by the Supreme Court, which could lead to the closure of more clinics. According to a 2013 study published in the Journal of Health Politics, Policy, and Law, since 1973 2013 the year the Supreme Court struck down state abortion bans in Roe v. Wade 2013 law enforcement and the courts have still arrested and prosecuted hundreds of women for pregnancy losses or poor pregnancy outcomes. Some cases involve drug use and the perceived harm to fetuses; others involve allegations of trying to end a pregnancy illegally. 201cThese measures create a 2018Jane Crow 2019 system of law, establishing a second class status for all pregnant women and disproportionately punishing African American and low-income women, 201d the study 2019s authors, Lynn Paltrow and Jeanne Flavin, argued. Paltrow 2019s group, National Advocates for Pregnant Women, also filed a brief in Patel 2019s appeal. 201cStillbirths, miscarriages, abortions (including those that are self-induced and do not conform to abortion regulations), and women 2019s mental health during pregnancy are health issues, not matters for the criminal justice system, 201d they wrote. To involve the criminal justice system, according to the brief, would result in the 201cperpetuation of second-class status for women, and the likelihood that such prosecutions will target poor women and women of color, who are already disproportionately subject to law enforcement surveillance, arrest, and punishment. 201d Patel comes to her appeal with a new legal team, including Stanford professor Lawrence Marshall, who founded Northwestern 2019s famous Center on Wrongful Conviction. In their appeal brief, they argue that the state failed to bring evidence that Patel knew how far along she was. They also say that the charges make no sense: How could the state argue that Patel committed feticide 2013 causing the death of a fetus -- when they also say she had a live birth whom she neglected? And even if the baby had been born alive, Patel 2019s attorneys argue, the state didn 2019t show that her seeking immediate medical attention would have made a difference. At the heart of the appeal is whether, indeed, the state can prosecute a pregnant woman herself under a feticide law, when the abortion statute currently says a woman can 2019t be prosecuted for having an abortion. RELATED: How Indiana's pregnancy law targets women Indiana prosecutors say Patel simply causing the end of her pregnancy amounted to feticide, even if there was no actual fetal demise. As for whether she herself could be put on trial, 201cthe legislature has never included an exception in the feticide statute to prevent it from being applied to the pregnant woman herself, 201d the state wrote in its appeal. In fact, the state 2019s attorneys added, before Roe v. Wade, Indiana, among other states, had a history of prosecuting women themselves for illegal abortion: 201cEnacted in 1881 and continuing in effect for almost 100 years, Indiana had a statute making it a criminal offense for a pregnant woman to solicit an abortion, 201d they wrote. The state 2019s message was clear. Women once could be prosecuted for abortion. So why not again?  ",

   "input": "The GIF has had a tumultuous history. The image format, which stands for Graphics Interchange Format, always struggled against the JPEG 2014 it was unable to handle colors as well as its counterpart, despite being able to support animation. For almost 30 years, it lived on the fringe of photography, taken seriously only in the context of arguments over how to pronounce it. (The official answer: jif, like the peanut butter brand). But the future now looks rosy for the GIF. In recent months, some of the largest and most influential technology companies have embraced the image format as a way to bridge the gap between still photography and video. For Apple, these animated images are called Live Photos, short stop-action movies recorded in the seconds before and after shooting a still image. At Instagram, it 2019s called a Boomerang: a short looping video that 2019s best used to capture subtle movements in static situations. Companies like Instagram and Phhhoto have been trying to make it easier for non-professionals to produce GIFs and short animations. 201cMotion can add another layer or perspective to the story you want to tell, 201d says John Barnett, a product manager at Instagram who worked on Boomerang. The app, released last year, came after Instagram realized it had a thriving video community on its platform, where 201cpeople were already experimenting with motion in new and exciting ways, 201d Barnett tells TIME. No matter their monikers, these animations expand the potential for storytelling. For Alex Chung, the co-founder of Giphy, a GIF depository valued at more than $300 million, the short looping videos offer deeper stories than still photographs. According to his math, given that a picture is worth a thousand words and a GIF is composed on average of sixty frames, than a GIF is worth sixty thousands words 2014 201cabout the length of a novel, 201d he jokes. One example Chung cites of the power of the GIF is the image of Hillary Clinton brushing her shoulder during her Benghazi hearing on Capitol Hill in October of 2015. The bored look, the contained sigh, the dismissive gesture 2014together, they 2019re enough to get a sense of how the 11-hour interrogation felt for the former Secretary of State and how she handled the situation. A still image from the same moment, meanwhile, would likely not have had such a clear meaning. In photography, most practitioners have yet to embrace the format despite its advantages 2014but that may be changing. For example, Oakland-based photographer Brandon Tauszik used GIFs to document his town 2019s black barbers in a project called Tapered Throne. 201cThe GIF contains the passage of time from film, 201d he says, 201cwhile also allowing for the decisive moment aspect of a still image 2014and all on infinite loop. 201d 201cThe art of the GIF is under-appreciated, 201d echoes Chung. 201cIt 2019s like photography: taking a picture is easy, but taking a good one is hard. Every GIF has been hand-done and emerges out of a series of deliberate decisions. 201d Chung believes photographers will soon see the benefit of GIFs 2014especially if Giphy has anything to say about it. On March 14, the company announced the opening of a GIF production studio in Los Angeles under the creative helm of revered animator Nick Weidenfeld. The studio will employ up to 500 artists to provide high quality and high-end GIFs and support to the wider community. And that 2019s just the beginning. Russell Armand, the co-founder of the animated image platform Phhhoto, sees a coming revolution in how images will be used and experienced in the near future. 201cThe definition of a picture and the definition of photography is evolving in this truly digital space, 201d says Armand. 201cPictures can do things that pictures were never supposed to do, and at some point soon, messaging will just happen inside the pictures themselves. 201d That interactive future for photography is not yet here, but GIFs are perhaps the harbingers of what 2019s the come. 201cIt 2019s not just about looking at a beautiful picture, 201d he says, 201cit 2019s actually going inside it and experiencing something that 2019s far deeper than what you can just see. 201d 2014 With reporting by Laurence Butet-Roch Austin, Texas.

Of course I didn 2019t know what was going on, 201d the 72-year-old told The Associated Press in telephone interview. 201cMy neighbor called me and asked if I was shooting, and I said 2018No, not me.' 201d Markward said the shooting suspect once helped him split wood, but said he hadn 2019t seen the man in a few years. 201cAs far as I know, he was all right, 201d he said. Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he didn 2019t have details about the shooting but said it underscored the danger that the state 2019s law enforcement officers face. 201cIt 2019s a risky business and it really illustrates the importance of our support for law enforcement, 201d Hutchinson told reporters at an event in North Little Rock. U.S. Rep. Bruce Westerman, whose district includes part of Sebastian County, also didn 2019t have details about the incident but echoed the governor 2019s support for police statewide. 201cThis has to stop, 201d Westerman said. 201cIt 2019s a shame the price that law enforcement officers are paying right now and, again, I don 2019t know any details about what 2019s happening here, but my heart and prayer is with them and their families. 201d  ",

The US Department of Commerce is due to cede stewardship of ICANN, or the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, as scheduled after a lawsuit seeking to halt the transition was denied by a federal judge in Texas on Friday. The US government has been the primary manager of the internet's address book since 1988 largely because it was invented in the country. Critics of the handover have attempted to block or delay it on grounds it could jeopardise free speech online, claims that the Obama administration and technology companies have said lack merit. The lawsuit filed on Wednesday against the federal government by the Republican states of Arizona, Texas, Nevada and Oklahoma argued the handover was unconstitutional and required congressional approval. ICANN, a California-based nonprofit, manages the database for top-level domain names such as .com and .net and their corresponding numeric addresses that allow computers to connect. After the transfer, ICANN will be governed by a collection of academics, technical experts, private industry and government representatives, public interest advocates and individual users around the world, in what it calls a multi-stakeholder process. Federal officials began discussing a plan to move ICANN under international oversight in the 1990s , and rolled out a formal plan in March 2014. Conservatives in the US Congress, led by Republican senator Ted Cruz of Texas, sought to prevent the handover earlier in September by attaching an amendment to an unrelated stop-gap funding bill for the US government. Cruz called the transfer a giveaway to Russia and other governments , but his effort failed to gain traction. A delay would have backfired by undermining US credibility in international negotiations over internet standards and security, the Obama administration and technical experts have said. Asked whether the four states which had sued the administration would appeal Friday's court ruling, Monica Moazez, a spokeswoman for Nevada's attorney general, responded in an email that they were weighing options. The other states could not be immediately reached. The transfer is a symbolic , but important step in preserving the stability and openness of the internet, which impacts free speech, our economy and our national security, Ed Black , chief executive of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, said in a statement.

   "input": "A trip abroad in August was delightful in all ways but one: I was forced to leave my trusty Swiss Army knife at home. For those of us with shaky self-esteem, who feel the other shoe is always about to drop, this handsome multipurpose tool lends a certain confidence. It 2019s the sensation that, while you might not be able to parry every thrust the world throws at you, you 2019ll never want for a corkscrew or scissors. On previous occasions, when the Transportation Safety Administration agent instructed me to open my bag, pull out my knife, then offered me the option of checking my bag or forfeiting the device, I did the latter. Then I settled into a funk, because I 2019m out $50 or so, I 2019ve let down my family 2014how are they supposed to open a bottle of wine now? 2014and just because I loved the little fellow. So when I received an invitation to an event at the Victorinox Swiss Army flagship store in SoHo a couple of weeks ago, I saw a perfect opportunity to lobby the company on behalf of my brilliant, TSA-friendly idea: a Swiss Army knife without the knife. While I 2019d certainly miss a blade when the need arose to cut a piece of cheese or slice a salami on an alpine picnic, I 2019d still have the reassurance that there was no bottle or can I couldn 2019t gain access to. At the party, I wondered aloud to Renee Hourigan, Victorinox 2019s director of marketing, whether customers actually use the toothpick and tweezers. They add to the knife 2019s bragging rights, but I 2019ve always found them ineffectual. 201cPersonally, I pluck my eyebrows with our tweezers, 201d Ms. Hourigan boasted. 201cOur repair department is constantly replacing tweezers and toothpicks. 201d I own two Swiss Army knives: the Waiter, which has only the essentials, a corkscrew among them, and a second model, whose name I don 2019t know, that I bought a long time ago. It 2019s one of those with dozens of tools that could probably help survive the apocalypse. In the meantime, it 2019s too heavy to comfortably carry around in your pocket. Nonetheless, I spotted a $400 model at the store that has both a barometer and an altimeter. That 2019s the thing about Swiss Army knives. You don 2019t really need them, but you can 2019t help but covet them. Meanwhile, it turns out that Victorinox beat me to the punch with the concept of a knifeless knife. 201cWe have created one, 201d Ms. Hourigan said, directing me to a locked display case. 201cWe have a series called the Jetsetter. There 2019s an assortment of tools, missing the blade because of TSA concerns. After 9 11, our Swiss Army knife took a major hit. 201d The Jetsetter comes with scissors, bottle opener, Phillips screwdriver, wire stripper (not that I 2019ve had many occasions to strip a wire), key ring, tweezers and toothpick. 201cIt 2019s not on the little guys, 201d she admitted. And how about some of the other tools 2014aren 2019t they mostly for show? The tiny saw, for instance? 201cWe 2019ve had field tests done, 201d Mr. Hourigan said. 201cWe 2019ve had reports a four-inch trunk of a tree can be reasonably cut with this. 201d How often does the need arise to cut a four-inch tree? However, the desire to uncork a bottle of Cheval Blanc occurs frequently. What good is a Swiss Army knife that lacks not only a knife but also a corkscrew? 201cThink screw-top wine, 201d Ms. Hourigan suggested. 201cI was turned off by the concept initially, but I found a bottle I liked. 201d In fact, sales of the Jetsetter have been disappointing. 201cIt doesn 2019t sell as well as we thought it would, 201d she said. 201cThe argument against it is that it doesn 2019t have a blade. 201d I could have told her so, though I came up with the same idea. Above all, a Swiss Army knife provides subliminal protection. It 2019s a weapon. Even if those we 2019re mostly likely to cut are ourselves.  ",

Moore is chief executive of Boston-based Clear Ballot, whose technology promises greater accuracy 2014 along with tabulated vote totals that can be shared more quickly with officials, candidates, and voters. It will be used in Florida and several other states Tuesday. Moore was a senior vice president at Lotus before turning his attention to elections in 2009. 201cThese election officials are living in a technological backwater, 201d he said. 201cThey 2019re using antiquated systems that were purchased more than 12 years ago based on 10-year-old designs. 201d Most paper ballots cast in this country are placed in electronic scanners to be counted. But the scanning can be problematic when people fail to correctly fill out the small oval bubble indicating who they want to vote for. In a close race, election officials examine each paper ballot by hand to ensure they have the correct vote count. Clear Ballot 2019s software works with the commonly used ballot scanning systems, adding a digital layer that uses optical scanners and Clear Ballot 2019s software to capture an image of each oval bubble that 2019s been filled in. Within those images, the company can help find votes that have been improperly marked 2014 if the voter checked the bubble, perhaps, instead of completely filling it in. Thus, the Clear Ballot system can help determine the intent of the voter, avoiding the frustrating and time-consuming manual examinations that followed the 2000 Florida election. Any problem ovals are arranged so they can be easily found. 201cThat 2019s where all the fighting is done in a recount, 201d Moore said. 201cWe 2019ve applied modern imaging technology to the problem of delivering transparency in elections. 201d On Election Day, the system will be used in several states to both tally and audit results. In Oregon, where all residents cast their votes by mail, Clear Ballot designed the mail-in ballots, which will be scanned to tabulate the results in more than half of the state, including two of its largest counties. And in Florida, Vermont, New York, and Maryland, election officials will be using Clear Ballot to selectively audit votes a few days after they 2019ve been cast, creating a digital snapshot of the vote count to check against the actual Election Day tallies 201cOur office has been using Clear Ballot for the past three years, and we are pleased with the product, 201d said Tonya Edwards, the voter education coordinator for Broward County in Florida. Election officials in Maryland and several counties in Florida are planning to post election result databases generated by Clear Ballot online for public review. Moore said his system offers a level of accountability that has not been seen in voting technology, and he hopes the company will be able to expand into other states next year. 201cPrecision is what you really need to resolve the closest of elections, and our system is as precise as it gets, 201d he said. 201cWe 2019ve had two counties and two elections bring in the losing candidate and show them that they fairly lost. And though they could command a recount none of them did. 201d Clear Ballot uses imaging technology to inspect ballots that have been incorrectly filled in and decide if the voter 2019s intent was clear. In this example, X 2019s and check marks were used instead of filled-in ovals.  ",

Kelly is said to have not made up her mind about staying with Fox News beyond the end of her contract in July, even with an offer of more than $20 million a year to stay, which would put her in the same income bracket as NBC 2019s 201cToday 201d co-anchor Matt Lauer. So far no other networks have offered to top Fox 2019s figure, according to network news executives and agents familiar with the talks and who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. A spokesperson for Creative Artists Agency, which represents Kelly, declined to comment on her contract negotiations. Kelly 2019s future is being closely watched. She is the first breakout talent in the TV news business in recent years, becoming an even bigger name in the aftermath of her showdown with President-elect Donald Trump at the first Republican primary debate in 2015. In an earlier era, her availability likely would have commanded a bidding war. But in a fragmented media environment where there are no longer surefire ratings hits, networks are cautious about making major financial commitments. Fox News is willing to give Kelly a raise over the $15 million a year she is currently earning because she consistently attracts more than 3 million viewers a night for her prime-time program 201cThe Kelly File. 201d But there is no guarantee that the loyalty of the Fox News audience is transferable to another channel, where Bill O 2019Reilly, the most popular personality on cable news, would not be her lead-in. One agent who handles TV news talent noted how executives have been wary of taking a star out of a successful format since Katie Couric moved from NBC 2019s 201cToday 201d in 2006. After leaving the top-rated morning show, Couric was unable to move 201cCBS Evening News 201d out of third place in the ratings. She then failed in a bid with a daytime syndicated talk show. 201cKatie Couric is the perfect example of how her success at the 2018Today 2019 show never transferred to anyplace else, 201d said the agent, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 201cAnd that happens with most people. 201d A story on the Drudge Report, citing unnamed sources, said CNN President Jeff Zucker is making an aggressive play to bring Kelly to his network, which trails Fox News in the ratings. CNN declined to comment on the report. While Zucker is a fan of Kelly 2019s work, there is internal skepticism that he can poach her because his network has eschewed huge salary deals for on-air talent. Anderson Cooper is the top earner at CNN, receiving between $10 million and $12 million a year in his latest contract. After Cooper, the salary drop-off is significant, with no other CNN anchor earning more than $3 million a year. Zucker 201cthinks Megyn Kelly is great, but we 2019re not going to pay her enough, 201d said one executive not authorized to comment publicly. 201cI think it 2019s more likely that she convinces the Murdochs [the family that controls Fox News parent 21st Century Fox] to pay her what she wants. 201d ABC News has been cited as the top broadcast suitor for Kelly 2019s services on its major profit center 201cGood Morning America. 201d But after report from the Drudge Report surfaced Thursday, executives said the network is no longer pursuing her. NBC could spread the expense for Kelly across its broadcast network programs and its cable news network MSNBC, but another agent has not heard of any interest from the network. A spokesperson for NBC News declined to comment. A spokesperson for Fox News did not respond to a request for comment. The newest round of speculation about Kelly 2019s next move comes amid negative reaction within Fox News over her new book, which includes allegations that she was sexually harassed by the division 2019s former Chief Executive Roger Ailes. Ailes resigned from his position in July amid a sexual harassment lawsuit and allegations from other women in the company. He has denied all of the accusations. O 2019Reilly has said he believes that rehashing the Ailes case in the book was hurtful to the company, which has tried to get past the controversy. Relations between Kelly and O 2019Reilly have reportedly been strained over the past year since Kelly first clashed with Trump. But internal tensions have never kept millionaire anchors from working side by side at any network.

   "input": "GiggedUp, which launched yesterday, is a social site for posting video job interviews. Users create profiles, post their resume in up to four different formats, add a list of skills and languages spoken, and request endorsements from friends. You can also link to your profiles on LinkedIn, YouTube and MySpace, as well as your personal website. Other profile sections include your target salary and your profile stats (how many users have visited your page). The unique feature, of course, is the ability to upload a video interview - put on your shirt and tie, record yourself answering a series of interview questions and add it to your GiggedUp profile. If you 2019re an employer, you can post a video about the job vacancy you have available. You can see the founder 2019s profile page and video here, but you 2019ll need to be logged in. For job candidates, GiggedUp is always free. For employers, meanwhile, there 2019s a charge of $265 for each vacancy you post - according to GiggedUp, that compares to $650 on Monster.com, $145 on LinkedIn, $489 on CareerBuilder and $25 on Craigslist. None of these sites, they point out, support video interviews. Meanwhile, a subscription to GiggedUp 2019s 201cVideo Profile Database 201d costs $750.00 month. Of course, the utility of these services depends entirely on the number of users, and charging these fees upfront before they 2019ve reached critical mass could be unwise. Another issue is that posting a video takes more bravery than posting a resume: pre-populating the site with more sample jobs and interviews may convince new members to join in. It 2019s interesting to see all these new combinations being tried - travel plus YouTube, weather plus YouTube, a YouTube for how-tos and so on. Whether job hunting and video go well together remains to be seen - and if they do, you can bet that LinkedIn will quickly add this as a feature.  ",

Which is fair enough, really. Finding out that the story has been going on without you must be rather disheartening.

   "input": "BY LAN NGUYEN DAILY NEWS FEATURES WRITER Monday, February 19th 2001, 2:20AM In August 1997, Dr. William Fair was told he had 18 months to live. Diagnosed with colon cancer two years earlier, the chairman of urology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center learned from a routine CAT scan that his cancer despite two surgeries and chemotherapy had returned a third time. My surgeon told me , 'If you want me to operate, I will do it, ' he recalls. But it was right under the liver. There are major blood vessels there , along with the bile ducts. Facing some tough decisions , Fair went on a religious retreat that Labor Day weekend to think things through. Staring out over the Pacific Ocean, he decided on an alternative plan of action. I did a lot of thinking and praying and talking , says Fair. I wanted to live as high a quality of life as possible for as long as possible. I knew what was recommended to me at the time was some more surgery and then some radiation. I knew my quality of life would be virtually zero from day one of starting that. So instead of surgery and radiation , he opted to change his diet, virtually eliminating red meat and adding more soy; he took up yoga and other stress-reduction practices; he started taking vitamins, a nonsteroidal inflammatory agent and a Chinese remedy called SPES, and most important, he retired. Cut to the present. Fair who will celebrate his 66th birthday in March and is active lecturing, writing and working on seven journals continues his regimen because I am afraid to stop. I honestly don't know what worked. He adds , I went through two surgeries and a year of chemotherapy. I think it was the right thing to do. It was only after they failed that I decided that I didn't want to do any more. Fair's search for answers outside conventional medicine and his adoption of a different lifestyle one that embraces complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is not uncommon. Like Fair , Carrie Levin and her family were suffering from myriad illnesses their physicians could not figure out. My oldest son , from the age of 5 on, had these coughs, says the owner of the homey upper West Side restaurant Good Enough to Eat. My second child , right after he was born, had these glands that were swollen on both sides of his neck and mucus was coming out of every hole in his face. We were going on antibiotics constantly. Frustrated by her children's continued illness and the conflicting diagnoses her eldest was thought to have a barking cough , whooping cough or allergies to mold and dust, while the second son was believed to have cancer she took her family to a homeopath in August 1993. Her older son was treated with phosphorous, while the younger boy received sulfur. Right away everything went down , says Levin. We were hooked. The family now balances visits to conventional physicians with visits to a homeopath and a chiropractor. They have also added yoga , reiki (a Japanese healing practice) and meditation to their health regimen. Fair and Levin are among millions of Americans who have sought help from complementary and alternative medicine. A study conducted from 1990-97 and reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1998 found that nearly 4 in 10 Americans have used complementary and alternative medicine, with total visits to CAM practitioners outnumbering visits to all U.S. primary care physicians. As a result, last spring the White House appointed a commission to look into the field and make recommendations. Its mandate is comprehensive: Our role is to recommend legislation to Congress and to the President about general approaches to developing research; approaches to providing and deciding which complementary and alternative therapies should be provided to Americans and how; recommendations about what kind of education health professionals of all kinds should have about CAM; what kind of information the public should get and how it should get it , and how approaches could be incorporated in programs for all Americans, says commission chairman Dr. James S. Gordon , who is also director of the Center for Mind-Body Medicine in Washington, D.C. It's an issue on which there is tremendous bipartisan interest; illness affects everyone. The White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy will release some recommendations in July and produce a report and make more recommendations in 2002. Increasing interest and demand have also driven health institutions to offer CAM therapies. Last year , Beth Israel opened its Continuum Center for Health & Healing, while Cornell Medical School created the Weill Cornell Center for Complementary and Integrative Medicine. Last month, Dr. Fair, with his son Bill and another partner, launched Haelth, the first of what they hope to be several such offices throughout the country. A client will meet with one of our program specialists , an RN who will help devise an integrated health treatment approach a plan for complementary therapies that is tailored to fit their lifestyles and health goals, explains Bill Fair. (Fair also has made changes in his life because of his father's illness. He changed jobs , is exercising regularly, has started eating breakfast, taken up yoga and cut down on red meat.) We want to encourage our clients to talk to their physicians and will serve as their communications conduit if they want us to. But before people sign up for a yoga class or drop by their local herbalist , they must realize that CAM is more than a series of techniques or a natural answer to pharmaceuticals , practitioners say. We do these therapies a grave injustice by trying to wrench them out of context , says Dr. Larry Dossey , author of Reinventing Medicine: Beyond Mind-Body to a New Era of Healing. A great example is meditation. Meditation has been reduced to the relaxation-response type of approach , where we just consider it a physiological exercise. Anyone who seriously studies meditation knows it is much more than that. Dr. Lewis Mehl-Madrona of Beth Israel's Continuum Center for Health & Healing agrees: What concerns me is if you were to compare two drugs to two herbs , most of the time, the two drugs will work better. It's the working on multiple levels of your being that is really powerful. One patient had asthma that was almost life-threatening and now it's gone. This patient came to see me about three years ago, and it took about a year, but she was willing to do whatever it took. That included changing her diet , learning new ways to deal with stress and grief, adopting different ways to process anger, changing the way she breathed and adding meditation and some spirituality to her life. It was about becoming a different person , says Mehl-Madrona. Perhaps the most important tenet for those who practice and live CAM is self-care. It is about being responsible for your own health and well-being. The amount of time that doctors can spend with their patients is low compared to what it used to be , says Dr. Victor Sierpina , author of Integrative Health Care: Complementary and Alternative Therapies for the Whole Person. HMOs have driven down the cost of care , but they have also reduced the amount of time that any doctor visit can last in order to meet their productivity goals. You can't get a whole story from somebody in seven minutes, which is the average office visit. It is also about learning what you need to lead a healthy and happy life. You can take a drug that would kill a microbe or suppress an infection or you could take something that would support your body , your mind, your spirit and your personal development, says Sheldon Lewis , editorial director of InnerDoorway, the parent company of the Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine journal. Lewis first first became involved with CAM after his pregnant wife went to an acupuncturist to treat her bronchitis and later found CAM more helpful than conventional medicine for their second son, who is developmentally disabled. The latter is how I would rather live my life. It's not surprising , then, that for Pamela Miles and other CAM users, complementary and alternative medicine is a total-life approach. There is not a separate category of our life that is health care , says Miles , who first became interested in yoga as a child and is now a writer and educator on CAM and a grand master of reiki. We have a healthy attitude toward life , problem-solving and day-to-day challenges.  ",

   "input": "By STEPHEN McFARLAND With News Wire Services Wednesday, January 10th 1996, 1:95AM Radio foulmouth Howard Stern's feminine side is more of a drag than even his critics say, according to fashion arbiter Mr. Blackwell, who put Stern at the top of this year's Worst Dressed Women list. Stern got dolled up as , well, a female person for the cover photo on his new book, Miss America , and that qualified him for the list. Let's face it , Howard's 'Miss America' drag looks like Godzilla impersonating Gypsy Rose Lee, said the acerbic Blackwell , self-appointed arbiter of fashion, who has appeared on Stern's syndicated radio talk show. Cross-dressing comedians Milton Berle and Flip Wilson made previous lists, which Blackwell born Richard Selzer in Brooklyn has compiled for 36 years. The rest of this year's list was all women. They included last year's winner Camilla Parker-Bowles , the other woman in the Prince Charles-Princess Di split in sixth place. She earned the special title Queen of Fashion Frump. Ms. Bowles is the biggest bomb to hit Britain since the Blitz , said Blackwell. English actress Emma Thompson was No. 9 on the list of the sartorially challenged , inspiring Blackwell to a somewhat lame rhyme: It's said the Lady of London acts with passion and power , but I think her designer should be sent to the Tower [of London]. 2. Rocker Courtney Love a frenetic baby doll , lost in a galaxy of grunge. 4. Whoopi Goldberg Most comedians do comedy routines Whoopi wears them. 5. Actress and director Diane Keaton positively spooky. 7. Actress Jennifer Jason Leigh looks like a neo-punk princess wearing toxic waste. 8. Rocker Melissa Etheridge dresses like a down-and-out reject of a rock 'n' roll road show. 10. Actress Christina Applegate Applegate is to fashion what Watergate is to politics. Blackwell also awarded a booby prize to former Guess jeans model and millionaire's widow Anna Nicole Smith , for her fatal fashion 'bust.' On the up side , Blackwell praised one of the stars who appeared in the film 'To Wong Foo . . .' in drag. One of the most beautiful visions of the year turned out to be Patrick Swayze. Go figure , he said. Blackwell also listed 10 women whose attire he admires: Madonna , Barbra Streisand, Princess Diana, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Grace Mirabella, Sandra Bullock, Glenn Close, Barbara Davis, Angela Bassett and Sharon Stone.

   "input": "BY MITCHELL FINK WITH EMILY GEST Friday, October 30th 1998, 2:05AM The warring stops when the clock is ticking and the talk turns to money. That's why Madonna and her Maverick Records partner and former manager, Freddy DeMann, who had a bitter parting in 1996, are sitting down together and trying to be cordial. Maverick Records is definitely in play right now , DeMann tells me, and could be sold before the label's joint venture deal with Time Warner runs out in July. Madonna, DeMann and others own 50% of Maverick, which knowledgeable observers estimate could fetch as much as $200 million on the open market. With the help of such artists as Alanis Morissette, Prodigy and Candlebox, Maverick has managed to generate a reported $750 million in revenues since it was founded in 1992 by Madonna, DeMann and minority owner label exec Guy Oseary. The price could be driven down, however, if the two principals are perceived only as rivals. They often sit at tables and talk business says Madonna's rep , Liz Rosenberg. And in this case, it's big business. So this new effort on their part to appear peaceful is not without its motives. I don't know if this means anything, but when Madonna became a brunette recently, DeMann dyed his hair blond, so they may be on a similar wavelength. Or, quips Rosenberg, Maybe they switched bottles. Were Lily Tomlin and Don Rickles each paid $1 million to appear in those commercials discussing long-range money management with Fidelity Investments Vice Chairman Peter Lynch? Neither star would confirm that amount , but I have it on excellent authority. In the commercials, which have been airing since September, Rickles deals with retirement issues. Tomlin plays a variety of Laugh-In-like characters all of whom are trying to figure out how to invest. A Fidelity representative also declined comment. GOING TO BAT FOR MARION The late baseball umpire John McSherry was honored last night when the foundation that bears his name held its annual fund-raiser at the All-Star Cafe. Many luminaries from the world of baseball were there , but I doubt much attention was paid to one person in particular. That's Marion Doyle, McSherry's live-in companion for the last 10 years of his life. When the 51-year-old McSherry collapsed and died in Cincinnati's Riverfront Stadium in 1996, he left behind 27 years of service and a sizable pension. McSherry had no heirs, unless you count Doyle. But the Major League Umpires Association refused to recognize her as a beneficiary on the grounds that she and McSherry never married. A McSherry Foundation source says the late ump's friends were concerned that Marion had enough money to live on after John died , and she said she was okay. Doyle knew she wasn't eligible for McSherry's pension , the source added , and has accepted the decision. That doesn't mean I have to accept it. BOYS TO MEN AT MSG While the Knicks aren't playing , Madison Square Garden is using its basketball floor for the next best thing: bar mitzvahs. And there was quite a bash there on Saturday night for Michael Steinberg son of Bear Stearns senior managing director Robert Steinberg I hear. Not that anyone ever crashed a bar mitzvah, but tickets to the event, printed with the MSG logo, heralded the event as one night only and thirteen years in the making. Also on the floor: those great bar mitzvah guys the Harlem Globetrotters. You may recall that L.A. Doctors regular Sheryl Lee resurrected her role as Laura Palmer from Twin Peaks when she posed nude on a morgue slab in an ad sponsored by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. The ad copy read: I wouldn't be caught dead in fur. Now the avid animal rights activist , who co-stars in John Carpenter's Vampires , has done a new version of the ad a Vampires spoof complete with bite marks and blood flowing from her neck. And therein lies the problem. The ad was already being distributed when PETA's retouchers realized their mistake: In the movie , Lee is bitten on the inner thigh.  ",

But there was a big lie in those lyrics, here's chris connelly. &#9834; Reporter: As the lead singer for his band lights over paris, robert mawhinney wanted to be a rock star in the worst way. In this, he succeeded. He fulfilled his every rock n roll fantasy. Starring in sexy music videos, throwing wild, all-night parties at his luxury dwellings across los angeles. Including this $10-g's a month riot house in the hollywood hills. I have no idea where all the women came from. Loud party, misdemeanor. Hey, if it's not a, felony, let's keep partying! Reporter: Hitting the road with no expense spared. Spraying pricey champagne off the balcony of a penthouse suite. Deploying an in-concert money gun. He really liked the idea of shooting money into the crowd. Reporter: Even building this one-of-a-kind fabulously appointed $750, 000 tour bus. It's called the futureliner. This window here will go all the way around , like, 270 degrees. Really cool. Over here's just gonna be, you know, a lounge area, tv on the wall right here. Reporter: He had all this, and a key rock-star pre-requisite: Tons of apparent self-confidence. But most of all, robb mawhinney had serious stacks of cash. I basically had an endless bank account with, you know, money inside of it. Reporter: What no one realized, until the bill came due, was that all of it, the whole star-spangled shebang, was not what it seemed to be. A big lie? Right from the get-go. A complete lie. Reporter: As a teen in orange county, mawhinney idolized high-energy rock bands who'd climbed the ladder to multi-platinum success. Like blink-182. But by his mid-20s, he & his homeboys weren't going anywhere. And lights over paris had no recording contract, no gigs, no merch. Yet somehow, robb had cheddar like a cracker barrel. Brimming with bank and the urge to spend it, on things like trips to new york city. It was crazy. There was a lot of booze, a lot of champagne, and the hotel suite ended up getting trashed at the end of the trip, so -- Reporter: Brian king had responded to a craigslist ad to be a videographer for lights over paris. What he saw in ny? No rock, but a whole lotta high rollin'. any rock & roll. He got a bunch of his buddies from la, they all flew into new york. One of their friends, they got him to streak through several blocks in soho. Reporter: Ah, but then the 5'6 frontman , now calling himself robb talllll, because why not? Landed in an l.A. Recording studio, doing a lights over paris album with professional musicians. Even a string section in support. One small problem -- he didn't have a label. And he'd never made a record before. A lot of people didn't really know what the deal was with rob. People just thought he was a really wealthy guy who wanted to be the next blink 182. Reporter: But with his blink-and-you-missed-it rock resume, robb dug deep for top-shelf help. A choreographer, phat rhymes from the rap star game -- and a six-figure music video. Cast from a pool of women to star as the femme fatale in lights over paris' turn off the lights stunning olivia hardt , scream queen of syfy's sharknado-esque tv-movie arachnoquake, spotted a lag in robb's swag. I got in the transportation van. And I knew that it was rob sitting right next to me, the guy that I was gonna be kissing that day. But he did not say a word to me. I think he was a little bit nervous. We can't make out with your teeth on. No, I'm just saying, for that part -- I mean, after the scene, he's like, that wasn't as, as scary as i thought it was gonna be. It was definitely a first for him , and he let me know that. Reporter: Olivia says she soon began to wonder about the source of robb's boundless bankroll. What did he say to you when you asked, where is all this money coming from? He told me that his grandfather had passed away that he received some inheritance. I was working with my grandfather. We'd buy lots and we'd build houses on 'em. It succeed ed and I made a couple bucks. It was a big lie? Yeah. I know that now. He had a problem with people thinking he just walked into having money. Reporter: In fact , robb had walked into banks and asked for millions in loans. The loan officer in the bank, asked mr. Mawhinney to provide proof of the statements that he made in the application, regarding his assets and his income. To loan officers he produced documents listing $8 million in stocks. And this accountant-prepared 1040. 4 different banks issued mawhinney loans to the tune of $11 million. But as lights over paris toured, it turned out that there are some things that money can't buy. Like fans. A couple girls told me about a sold out show, about this band, lights over paris. And so I wanted to come see what was going on with this band. Reporter: When rock photographer derek brad got to the north star bar in philadelphia, those on stage nearly outnumbered the audience. There was actually less than 10 people here. Reporter: It was sold out, because robb tall had bought all the tickets. Only the lights over paris street team couldn't even give them away. Then on october 1, 2011 the night they were to play the roxy, on la's sunset strip, robb didn't even show up. Sending a dj in his place instead. Why wasn't robb doing the show? I guess his high school reunion was that night? Reporter: And how about this for a remix. That's the dj getting served, onstage, with legal papers intended for robb, now way behind on his riot house rent. The party, the parties, were over. One year later robb was arrested in miami. The $11 million in loans and the documents he submitted to get them? Yeah, about those -- the tax return was entirely fake. And the cpa whose name was used on the letter, again we interviewed him, and he said, again robert mawhinney? Never heard of him. Reporter: Then there was that big-money-in-stocks statement from schwab. This is what was submitted to the . And yes it says here , $8 million, total account value. That's correct. And then we obtained from charles schwab itself, here's the account statement. Same account for the period may 2009. And here you can see the value in the account, zero. Another big lie? Another complete fabrication. Reporter: Robb was charged with multiple felonies. And would plead guilty to 4 counts of making false statements, take responsibility for his actions in court, and be sentenced to 7 years in prison. From where he called us exclusively with a mea culpa for all that madness. The thing I regret is -- is kind of losing control. My lifestyle was, it was crazy. And I was hoping deep down that I could rectify the situation and -- and pay these things back. Reporter: Now between his bible study group meetings, robb says he is taking guitar lessons. Turned out robb really wasn't a gangsta or a player. Why would I spend so much money on a tour when we're not u2? Or green day. And that's one of the things that I sit in my cell and -- and -- and regret. Here's a man who wanted to be a star, but apparently didn't have the talent to do it. He had to do it through crime.

   "input": "For a team that would like to keep a young quartet of sure-to-be-expensive players, last week's news of a steadily fattening NFL salary cap was particularly welcome for the 49ers. How can they possibly pay quarterback Colin Kaepernick, outside linebacker Aldon Smith, guard Mike Iupati and wide receiver Michael Crabtree, all of whom are entering the final year of their rookie contracts? That question became a bit less vexing when it was revealed the salary cap, which was $123 million in 2013, will balloon to $133 million in 2014 and could rise to at least $150 million by 2016. In the short term, however, the extra $10 million available to teams this season could work against the 49ers. With free agency beginning at 1 p.m. Tuesday, the 49ers, who are averse to engaging in bidding wars for their on-the-market players, could find it harder to retain the trio probably at the top of their priority list: safety Donte Whitner, cornerback Tarell Brown and placekicker Phil Dawson. Former NFL personnel executive Bill Polian, now an ESPN analyst, expects the market for such players to be a bit more robust this year. History tells you that there will be more deals out there for big money than there were last year , Polian said. I think the biggest impact may come - and I underline the word may - with the so-called middle class. Last year , a lot of those fellas got one- and two-year deals. The so-called legal-tampering period of free agency begins at 9 a.m. Saturday , allowing agents to start negotiations before contracts can be signed Tuesday. Whitner, who will turn 29 in July, and Brown,29, are expected to test the market. Given their ages, it will probably be their last opportunity to land a lucrative, multiyear deal. Whitner, selected to his first Pro Bowl berth in 2012, will earn a raise after signing a three-year, $11.75 million contract in 2011. Meanwhile, Brown, who unwittingly forfeited $2 million in base salary in a contract snafu last year, also figures to cash in: Polian ranks Brown among the top three free-agent cornerbacks. In December, general manager Trent Baalke said the team had started contract discussions with Dawson and wide receiver Anquan Boldin. Boldin signed a two-year deal Monday, but the kicker remains unsigned after he outperformed his $2.25 million base salary in 2013. If recent history is a guide, the 49ers won't overpay to keep Whitner, Brown or Dawson. Instead, they could eventually use some of their extra salary-cap cash to ensure part of their quartet - Kaepernick, Smith, Iupati and Crabtree - never become free agents. As Polian noted, the top players never reach the open market. The best players are signed , he said. So (free agents) , essentially, are B players whose agents are looking for A money. Dobbs deal: Niners backup defensive tackle Demarcus Dobbs ,26, a restricted free agent, will be tendered a non-guaranteed, one-year contract by the 49ers at the lowest level, $1.431 million, USA Today reported. Dobbs will still be able to receive offers from other teams when free agency begins Tuesday, but the 49ers can match any offer. The 49ers would not be compensated with a draft pick if Dobbs signs elsewhere because he was an undrafted free agent. Eric Branch is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

   "input": "When Damien Hirst was a child, he never thought you could get paid for making art. His mother was a shorthand typist and his father a car salesman. His parents split up when he was 12. After his dad walked out of the family home in Leeds, money was tight at home and although the young Damien loved drawing and art galleries, he thought he'd have to get a proper job to make a living. We ran out of money and we couldn't pay the bills so we had the electricity cut off and things like that , Hirst ,48, says now. At school I tried to do technical drawing. I could see that could get you a job whereas I never thought 'artist' could be a job , I never thought artists could get paid. It was an art foundation course at Jacob Kramer School of Art (now the Leeds College of Art) that convinced Hirst that being an artist could be a proper career. That blew my mind , he says. Later he moved to London , went to Goldsmiths and his work was snapped up by 00fcber-collector Charles Saatchi. Today, Hirst is believed to be worth more than 00a3200m. One of the most famous artists of modern times, he is seen as the great populariser of conceptual art. It was Hirst who put a shark in formaldehyde, painted spots on a canvas and exhibited a skull encrusted with diamonds with a 00a350m asking price. But those formative experiences as a young boy in Leeds have left their mark. For all his success, Hirst still believes in the transformative nature of art for children. It is partly for this reason that, over the past few years, Hirst has been quietly building up his philanthropic work. One of his chosen charities, Kids Company, which works with disadvantaged and vulnerable children in London and Bristol, has benefitted to the tune of more than 00a32m from his donations. Last month, it was announced that Hirst would be auctioning a painting of Mickey Mouse (reinterpreted as one of his iconic spot paintings) and giving the proceeds to Kids Company. In doing so, Hirst joins a select group of artists, including Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, invited by Disney to recreate the corporation's most famous mascot. Hirst's Mickey is expected to reach up to 00a3750, 000. I've always believed art's more powerful than money , he says. The money's just a sideline. I remember those people who burned 00a31m and I thought it was disgusting. The K Foundation or something 2026 Yeah. He nods vigorously. You have to respect money. Money and art have long been intertwined in Hirst's mind. And it is this that has brought us here today , to Science, the airy central London headquarters of Hirst's art and business empire. The office is filled with his works, including a giant pill capsule and an intricate mosaic of butterflies 2013 even the lavatory is wallpapered with a Hirstian representation of pharmaceutical cabinet contents. But perhaps the most arresting installation of all is sitting on the sofa next to Hirst in the form of Camila Batmanghelidjh, founder and director of Kids Company, swathed in a bright crimson printed cloak and matching turban, with fluorescent yellow Crocs on her feet. The thing is , Batmanghelidjh says , by way of explanation, I can go from the crack den to the palace and not change outfits. Me , too, adds Hirst. Actually , I think I'm better in the crack den. The two of them whoop with laughter. Hirst first got involved with Kids Company in 2007 and has become one of its most generous backers. His donations have been a lifeline for a charity which gets 80% of its income from philanthropy. He never asked for public acknowledgement or anything like that , says Batmanghelidjh. So there was this funny world where I could see there were times when people were very envious of his success , but I couldn't publicly say: 'Do you realise how much this man is contributing?' Hirst interjects drily: It's just not very rock'n'roll. He shifts in his seat , rolling up the sleeves of his leather bomber jacket and tapping his trainers on the floor. Hirst's attention is mercurial, his speech so rapid he seems constantly on the verge of impatience. A lot of people give stuff to charity to make themselves feel good , he says. When I started off , I didn't have much money. I had an interest in art 2013 don't know where it came from 2013 and art helped me get where I've gone. So you do feel you want to give something back, but you don't feel you need to be acknowledged for that. It's a lot nicer to just do it. But might there not be another reason 2013 an attempt , perhaps, to rebrand himself? Over the past few years, Hirst has got divorced, gone sober and bought up most of Ilfracombe (arguably one of the most sedate places in Britain). Is his decision to talk about his philanthropic work connected to a deeper re-evaluation, an impending sense of his own mortality? I think I've constantly re-evaluated since I was seven , Hirst says blithely. You get older , you get calmer, hopefully you get wiser, but death is unknowable. It doesn't matter how old you are, you still can't get your mind around it. The work of Kids Company focuses on the needs of neglected inner-city children in London and Bristol , including the most deprived and at-risk whose parents are unable to care for them due to their own practical and emotional challenges. The charity's services reach 36,000 children and support 18,000 who need more intensive attention. A key part of this is art therapy: Kids Company is the biggest employer of arts psychotherapists after the NHS, and Hirst has been actively involved in developing its programme. What happens to traumatised children is they freeze often in shock and one of the first things that goes is their verbal abilities to describe the situation , explains Batmanghelidjh. By working with art therapists , the hope is that these children can eventually start showing the trauma through the art materials 2026 and they tend to have very powerful , emotional pieces that come almost from the bleakest spaces that they've gone to. She mentions the case of a nine-year-old girl who , when Batmanghelidjh first met her, had been subjected to years of sexual abuse by a family member and who was crawling on the ground and kind of howling and getting inside the cupboard in a foetal position. After six months of patient counselling and art therapy , the transformation was extraordinary. The next time she saw the girl , says Batmanghelidjh, She was sitting there with ribbons in her hair and was really girly-girly , with her box of little art materials cases all lined up. Art for these children , just as it was for Hirst, is a necessary means of expression. In 2009, Batmanghelidjh launched an initiative in which she asked 125 schoolchildren to use a shoebox to recreate a room from their home. The results were startling: one in six of the shoeboxes threw up child-protection issues. They told us things like: 'I feed the rats in the cupboard'; they talked about firearms being hidden; they talked about sexual abuse , says Batmanghelidjh. In order to raise the necessary cash to work with these children , she got in touch with Hirst and asked him to get a group of famous artists together to create their own shoebox rooms which were then stacked on top of each other like a tower block. The results were auctioned off, raising more than 00a3200, 000. Camilla's great like that with those kind of ideas , Hirst says. I mean , I get emails saying 'We're [auctioning off] artists' underpants, artists' shoes and artists' shirts and artists' mugs,' but to do something like that 2013 making a tower block, keeping it simple 2013 it's a great idea. The children relate to Hirst's art , says Batmanghelidjh, because his work is daring. It has a 'Why not?' attitude. Hirst , too, sees the best art as unapologetically child-like, quoting Brancusi's famous dictum that: When we are no longer children , we are already dead. I think a lot of people will say my work is childish or child-like and I think neither of those things is a bad thing , he says. The world's a very complicated place and sometimes you look at it and you feel like a child and that's the sort of best viewpoint. In the face of the world , we're always children. He encourages his own children 2013 Connor 18 , Cassius 13, and eight-year-old Cyrus 2013 to create. Hirst split up from his wife, fashion designer Maia Norman, in 2012 and seems to have adapted well to single parenthood, moving his sons into a big house in Richmond, in the leafy London suburbs. (He also owns Toddington Manor, a stately home in Gloucestershire, plus a farm in Devon and houses in Mexico and Thailand). Children, he says, can produce much better art than adults. I took my eight-year-old when he was about five to my studio for the first time. And when we got back he got a TV box , made a circle, put a chair in the middle and taped an umbrella to it over the top and put his own drawings on the wall and he sat in the middle and said: 'My studio's better than yours.' Hirst grins. You just go: 'Wow.' Adults , by contrast, are more hamstrung by their anxieties. You get an adult going: 'How many coats [of paint] should I use? What if it's bad?' And they get the fear , whereas kids just dive in, throw it all around. As a child , Hirst used to visit a local museum in Leeds where works of art were hung in the same rooms as stuffed Bengal tigers and fish in huge aquariums. He remembers being stunned both by the scale and the anarchic atmosphere 2013 both qualities which he tries to bring to his own work. For Hirst, size most definitely matters. What I quite like to do is take [my children's] ideas to another level sometimes , he says. My 18-year-old came home one day and he'd made a huge mosquito out of plastic boxes and it had a straw for a point and wings made with string , so I took them to the foundry and had it cast in bronze, the same size. It's not a massive effort to do that. Perhaps not if your father has access to a foundry. The issue with a lot of the children Batmanghelidjh deals with is that they don't have anyone to take their art home to 2013 let alone the opportunity to cast it in a precious metal. Instead , she encourages them to make objects and pictures that are sent as thank-yous to key donors. The vibrant, painted chair on which my Dictaphone lies is one such piece 2013 it is covered with colourful patterns and every available bit of space has a message of thanks scrawled across it. Once, Hirst recalls, he took delivery of a table from Kids Company. And they'd obviously been told to write something nice on it. So it was all: 'You're great , we love you, thank you so much' and then on the back someone wrote: 'Whatever.' He snorts with laughter. I love that. It's the kind of rebellious attitude that would appeal to Hirst , who, when he first started out, was often described as the enfant terrible of the art world. That stopped , he says, as soon as I started making any money , as soon as I could get tables at my favourite restaurants an hour before 2026 You start off kicking against the system and then you become the thing to be kicked against. I definitely feel more mainstream than outsider now. In fact , Hirst is often accused of being too mainstream. His work has been derided as shallow, overly commercial and derivative. Critics have lambasted him for not producing his own art 2013 Hirst famously got his assistants to produce thousands of spot paintings that bear his signature 2013 and for making money from what they see as little more than clever marketing. His diamond-encrusted skull, entitled For the Love of God, was condemned by the critics for its vulgarity and decorative nature when Hirst put it up for auction in 2007. But one teenager at Kids Company saw it differently. The diamond skull inspired one of our kids to do a piece on how trauma kills off your soul , says Batmanghelidjh. He'd seen the skull and then he started doing this whole funeral piece of skull heads. It was extraordinary 2013 and it was all because of seeing Damien's diamond skull. He did this piece about how child abuse had basically murdered pieces of him 2026 It was very haunting. How does hearing a story like that make Hirst feel? The word is 'inspirational' , isn't it? he replies. In my mind , when I imagine my audience, it's always a single person looking at my artwork. I'm aware that I make things for people to hook on to and connect to, but it's vague in my mind, so when you hear about a specific which is definite and somebody connects to it 2026 he trails off. For Batmanghelidjh , art has an even deeper resonance. She sees it as an example of audacity 2026 and I think the same cycle needs to be conceptualised in social care. You have to have the audacity to say: 'This is unacceptable' and come up with an alternative. The defence budget is 00a342.4bn , continues Batmanghelidjh. The Crossrail budget is about 00a340bn. The child-protection budget is 00a3113m. And , actually, we've got a catastrophic epidemic of childhood maltreatment in this country. And every so often, you hear about it because there's an inquiry when a child dies, but the death of that one child represents only the pin of a needle compared to the scale of children who've been maltreated behind closed doors. Hirst , sitting quietly on the sofa as Batmanghelidjh speaks, rubs his eyes with the tips of his fingers. I think briefly that he might be welling up. But when I look again, the slight moistness has gone and his gaze is re-focused. The world's fucked , he says sharply. What do you want me to say? I don't , no. Not yet, he grins. I kind of like the idea and I think it's a cop-out not to , but I can't see anything to vote for. He says people have a tendency to view an artist like some sort of saviour. You get it with Hollywood actors , rock stars [people saying]: 'Don't sell out, don't sell out!' he says. There's a sort of desperation that money taints and poisons everything 2026 Money's a big issue. It's as complex as love in the world today. As an artist , I think you should take that on and look at it. Money and love: the two , in Hirst's mind, seem inextricably linked. It's not that he thinks of money as a substitute for love, but at least it's a start. At least it can help to change the lives of deprived and vulnerable children. It can give them a voice and a vision. It can, as Hirst would put it, go some way towards making the world that little bit less fucked.

   "input": "Q. I had a nice-looking red brick patio installed in my backyard, then had a new exterior door installed. Now there is a gap of a few inches between the bottom of the door and the patio, so the installer filled the gap with plaster, which is already beginning to melt away. What can I do? - Tom Wall, South End A. I hope that the door has a proper threshold on its bottom, because a threshold of oak is the only thing that will make the door weatherproof. If not, have one installed. First get rid of the plaster, which is not the thing to use outdoors. It depends on how thick the gap is. If a threshold, sloped to all water runoff, fits in the gap, that is good. If there is a little more to the gap, put in a pressure-treated board to make up the difference. If there is still a gap, you can build a berm of concrete or bricks to close the gap. Q. You mentioned a good pipe wrap for pipes that have lost their asbestos insulation on a steam heat system, but I have forgotten. I have to tell my contractor what it is. Can you? A. It is compressed fiberglass. The contractor should know, and also will know what is needed to insulate the steam boiler. Q. I live in a three-decker which has back porches off the second- and third-floor units. The third floor has a tongue-and-groove deck (we 2019re told it was replaced 10 years ago) that leaks badly. Of course, both porches get wet but the rain also is clearly leaking through the boards. Also, all that damp is peeling the paint on the bottom of the third-floor deck. A contractor told us the problem is that the third-floor porch is laid flat and needs to be rebuilt on a slight incline. Do you think that will fix the problem? A. Yes, if the third floor deck was sloped a little, it would make a big difference. I would have to guess the third-floor deck is covered by a roof, as in all triple deckers I know. All three decks should be primed and painted with an exterior primer and exterior deck paint. Q. About a dead mouse in the wall, and the resulting stink. I called an exterminator, who said he could not even try to find the corpse, and suggested just waiting out the smell, which is already abating. Q. We have tried glue traps, food bags for their consumption, plastic, and wooden snap traps, etc. Anything else we can try? Somehow we remember you wrote about this at another time, but don 2019t quite remember the answer. A. To both of you Stumpees, there are not many tricks that will succeed. I had the same thing happen two years ago, and I broke into the wall in several areas with no success. An exterminator searched the wall with his TV scope, a little like a colonoscope, also without success, so he charged only $50. A little later, a fly discovered the corpse, laid hundreds of eggs, which hatched into maggots that escaped to my porch and caused my wife to go absolutely ape and destroyed all she could find. Then came hundreds of flies, which I dispatched with a spray; the next day fewer flies showed up, and on the third day, fewer until all were gone. By that time the smell began to fade, all was sweet again. Incidentally, using odor killers such as Febreze will not work as long as the source of the stink is still there. If you have mice and know where they are, using plastic traps are the best way to get 2019em all, plus closing every possible access hole in the house, the foundation and the wood sill on top of the foundation. To locate those holes, go in the basement on a bright sunny day and turn out all lights and light sources; you may see holes that you would otherwise miss. Q. We had our floors sanded and polyurethaned six years ago. Our foldable ironing board gradually scratched a small area. Can this section be locally sanded to remove the scratches and polyurethaned only on the affected area? A. Yes, sanding the scratched area lightly and applying two or three coats of water-based polyurethane varnish on the scratched area can work. So can coating the scratches with a stain just a little darker than the scratches. Q. I have a two small-opening windows about 24 201dx 15 201d on either side of a large picture window The windows open outward, but now do not work except by going outside and pushing them closed. Can I replace them? The same picture window is original from 1962. It 2019s pretty drafty, and I have been thinking about inside storm windows. I do not want to change the appearance of the house it consists of 15 window panels in frames same size as above Any suggestions? A. Those little windows are casement style (they open like a door), and most replacement windows can replace them. They can be had in a middle price range from some companies. As for the big picture window, inside storms are to come by and are usually room darkeners, too, so I suggest you have it replaced as well.  ",

   "input": "More a group hug than a group show, this mawkish male-bonding exercise takes its cue from the early 1970s Burt Reynolds vehicle of the same name, where a quartet of butch Atlanta businessmen achieve a testosterone high by canoeing through the most godforsaken backwaters of the Appalachian mountains. John Boorman's film is a bitter cocktail of machismo, mutilation and revolting backwoods encounters with the products of a steadily diminishing gene pool. As a starting point for four male artists primarily interested in their own masculinity, this has plenty of potential. Who will fulfil the role of the sensitive, guitar-strumming Drew (Ronny Cox in the film) for example? And, more to the point, who wants to be Burt? Sadly, the movie seems to have done no more than divert the show up Concept Creek without a paddle. Most of the darker undercurrents of the film are avoided, and its impressive ecological message is entirely ignored. Though there are witty and worthwhile individual contributions, there seems little to link the artists besides their all being men; this turns out to be no more illuminating than suggesting that none of them are zebras. Andrew McDonald takes top honours with his intimidating animation, The Return of John. Confronted with the provocations of an alarmingly headless aggressor, you begin to understand Sir Gawain's predicament with the Green Knight. If you wouldn't hit a man wearing glasses, what are you going to do about a man with nowhere to put them? Paul Stone's piece, Stay, is reminiscent of Kander and Ebb's image of transparent male insecurity from the musical Chicago, Mister Cellophane; only in this case it's Mister Polythene Bag. At this time of year a disquieting mannequin roughly manufactured from high street carriers can pass as thought-provoking art. Any closer to November 5 and you'd toss it a coin to let the irritating kids who made it buy fireworks. Pat Flynn's sculptural conceit of bringing the pixilated approximations of computer games to life proves that what we accept as an asteroid on a VDU screen could equally well signify the deposits of a huge cyber-elephant. Yuen Fong Ling's installation indicative of men at work - a pair of seminar flip-charts disgorging reams of unfilled paper - eloquently illustrates the arguments linking the movie and artistic responses together.

Nordegren,34, who rarely speaks publicly and gave to date to PEOPLE on the eve of her 2010 divorce from Tiger Woods, told her fellow Rollins College graduates at the Winter Park, Florida, commencement ceremony that she was surprised 2013 and a little scared 2013 when she got the call about the award and the commencement address that comes with it. After all , she said, I have been called a 'woman with no words' in the media and criticized for not talking very much.

Education is one thing that no one can take away from you. The Swedish-born American citizen said her fellow students helped her to keep going. When you told me stories about your full-time day jobs , about coming home to cook dinner for your families, and about making sure your children were cared for while you were attending classes, you inspired me, she said. Whatever obstacle I was facing at the time , your stories and sharing helped me put things in perspective. A nanny and one-time model when she met Woods , Nordegren, for whom English is a second language, had a reputation in pro-golf circles for being quiet and reserved. She joked Saturday about how, right after she had taken a class called Communication and the Media, I was unexpectedly thrust into the media limelight. I probably should have taken more notes in that class! In an exclusive interview for an upcoming issue of PEOPLE , Nordegren says that, whatever her initial trepidation, she ultimately embraced Saturday's speaking duties: If I can inspire even one mom to go back and get her degree with the message that it's never too late , then I am happy.

   "input": "If Jeff Wall sees something extraordinary - men running through the suburbs with rifles, a family being violently evicted from their home - he doesn't stop and take a photograph. He goes back to his studio and sets about recreating the moment, or what this precise Canadian, a part-time academic, would call the experience of the moment. He casts the protagonists , using amateur rather than professional actors, builds minutely detailed sets, and rehearses the action until he gets it right - then he takes the picture. Sometimes this process will take a month; sometimes it will take more than a year. Wall's picture After 'Invisible Man' By Ralph Ellison, an image of a man in a basement hung with 1,369 lightbulbs, inspired by Ellison's novel about a black outsider, took many months and a lot of broken bulbs to complete. Writers have it very easy , Wall says. They have the pleasure of imagining these scenes. Working on that picture , I really learned about what Ellison's 1,369 lightbulbs means. You can only have a few on at a time. I got to know that room as well as the Invisible Man would have, had he existed. So Wall's production values are extremely high , and to this extent he works more like a film director or a Renaissance studio painter than a photographer. Spontaneity itself, Cartier-Bresson's decisive moment , does not interest him - only the illusion or recreation of it. Perhaps his best-known work, A Sudden Gust Of Wind (After Hokusai), based on one of Katsushika Hokusai's 19th-century woodcuts of Mount Fiji, has the immediacy and high drama of a film still - the bare trees bending in the wind, the people crouched and hanging on to their hats - but is, in fact, a composite of more than 100 photographs, taken over two consecutive winters at a cranberry farm. When I began working on the computer , he says , I realised you don't have to do it all at once. Of course it's exciting trying to get everything in one shot , but working digitally slowed things down. It made the process more complicated and, I hope, deeper. Wall , who is 59, has lived in Vancouver, Canada, for most of his life. He was part of the city's avant garde art scene in the late 60s, and until recently was a lecturer in fine art at the University of British Columbia, near where he lives with his English wife and their three children. Growing up, Wall thought he wanted to be a painter, and spent weekends working on Jackson Pollock-inspired canvases in his parents' garden shed. In his early 20s, he moved on to what he now dismisses as very tentative , very interim conceptual art , but then got stuck and came to London to study history of art at the Courtauld Institute. There, he fell in love with 19th-century painters such as Manet, Degas and G 00e9ricault - and somewhat out of love with the abstract expressionist experiments of the time. Suddenly, the counterculture just didn't look as good, as rich, as the culture. It's not that I think what happened in the 60s and 70s was unimportant , he says. I just became convinced that I didn't want to do alternatives to traditional art - I wanted to do traditional art , make big pictures. If you look at Vel 00e1squez and C 00e9zanne and think, those two are more important to me than Warhol or Joseph Beuys, then you have to act on it. And I knew I wanted to be involved in pictorial art, my first affection and enthusiasm. Between 1971 and 1977 , Wall produced no work, but I wasn't doing nothing. I was looking hard at photography , which I started to do in London, and at painting and cinema - not just going to the movies, but really thinking about it. He was inspired by the European art house cinema of the 60s - Godard , Bergman, Antonioni, Fassbinder: I admire that type of artistry where one person can write and direct , and then someone else gives it its distinctive look. I don't think there's as significant a group of film-makers today as there was in 1963 - that kind of authorship just isn't present. Wall returned to Canada and began producing work again. In 1979 he had his first solo show , the centrepiece of which was a photograph of a vandalised room based on Delacroix's The Death Of Sardanapalus; Wall remembers that the picture was done in a hurry - it was full of the energy I had backed up from the 70s. But more than the subject matter , it was Wall's use of a new medium that had the biggest impact: he exhibited the picture as a transparency on a giant lightbox, so that from a distance it looked like a billboard or brilliantly lit theatre set. Close up, every last detail was vivid, almost three-dimensional. Here was photography you could turn on and off, and which had the instant appeal of film or television and advertising - radiant, backlit, hyper-real. When I discovered the transparency , it seemed viable like nothing else, Wall says. And the response was enthusiastic , at least from a small number of people, right from the beginning. I haven't really had to struggle. I suppose that's a good thing, but I'm not sure. Wall has worked with his transparencies ever since , taking advantage of whatever new technology comes along to produce increasingly perfect pictures - a process he calls cinematography. (You could say he has introduced struggle to what might have been an easy, too-accessible artform.) He has used his brilliant, perfecting medium to look at imperfect, marginal places and people - an insomniac waking from a nightmare on a dingy kitchen floor, a man with a bloody nose laughing on the street. Wall has a sense of humour, but it's a fairly dark one: his Vampires' Picnic, a kitsch bloodbath with blankets, was conceived in part as a comment on the cannibalism of celebrity culture. To start with, in the 80s, Wall thought his pictures should be about something. His 1982 picture Mimic, for instance, which looks like amazingly lucky street photography but was performed by actors in front of lights and a large-format camera, was about racism. To a modern audience , it might look as if the bearded man is on the phone, but in fact he is stretching the skin under his eyes and sneering or saying something to an Asian stranger, while his girlfriend squints in unconscious mimicry out of the frame. Today, though, Wall wants his pictures to be purely aesthetic experiences. Twenty-five years ago I thought subject matter had some significance in itself , he says. Mimic was about racism in some way , about hostile gestures between races, but I'm glad the picture itself is good and it doesn't need that to be successful. Now I try to eliminate any additional subject matter - those things are for other people, they're not my problem. This is the great , and frustrating, contradiction in Wall's work: so many of his pictures are bursting with drama and suppressed narrative, yet he does not want to get caught up in this reductive business of what-it-all-means. Every picture does not tell a story; the camera is more interesting when it lies. At Wall's solo show at the Whitechapel in 1996, the first image you saw was his vast 4m x 2m battlescape Dead Troops Talk, in which Russian corpses smile and scream and stagger over a stony bomb crater, their insides hanging out. The title gave a date and location, near Moqor, Afghanistan, Winter 1986, but Wall says it is not about that conflict, or even about war. He started instead with an idea for a picture about dead people coming back to life and having a conversation: They needed to have something to talk about , so I picked soldiers because they're connected to a cause they may not comprehend or agree with. But it didn't matter which soldiers or which war - I could have had my pick. As well as his large-scale transparencies , Wall likes to work on more intimate, documentary photography, which uses no digital effects, no crew, and far less time. Up to 15 years ago , most of my pictures were views and landscapes of the city. Then I just moved in a little bit closer, taking pictures of a little sink in the cellar of my studio, and I learned a lot. I can go back and forth between the cinematography and the documentary material; they're two sides of the same coin. A picture like Peas And Sauce takes me 10 minutes to make, but it's not major or minor, it's not this or that, they're both equal in my mind. It's a flexibility that gives him huge range as an artist - his work encompasses the heroic and the banal , the kitsch and the lyrical, the epic and the miniature. He tries to keep the two kinds of work separate, and labels his pictures as one or the other - but sometimes even a purist has to cheat. His lovely, lambent Dawn was shot under documentary conditions on a Vancouver street corner, but the street lights went off a minute before the colour in the sky was perfect, so Wall ended up blending two pictures. Admittedly there's a slight alteration to the truth , he says , but it's a very minor adjustment. It's within the terrain of documentary photography: if I added a person , it might not be. There's a fine line between fact and fiction , between a moment and a perfect representation of that moment; Jeff Wall's best work comes from never having to choose. 00b7 Jeff Wall is at Tate Modern, London, from October 21-January 8 2006  ",

   "input": "Twilight: Photography in the Magic Hour V&A, London SW7, until 17 Dec Although photography writes with light, it has always flirted with darkness, both excited and alarmed by the erasure of its luminous inscriptions. Some photographers are sun-worshippers: Edward Weston delighted in the searing glare of Mexico, and Man Ray preached the arrival of an 'age of light', with solarised bodies as 'oxidised residues', irradiated by photo-chemistry. Other photographers prefer the inky, inscrutable night. Bill Brandt photographed the gloom of London during the Blitz, and Brassai spied on the nocturnal perversities of Paris. They all practice a Manichean art, which captures light and seals it inside the camera's blackened chamber. Hence the appeal of dusk, which is the subject of the V&A's subtle, exquisite new exhibition: 'Twilight: Photography in the Magic Hour'. Twilight prevaricates unsteadily between day and night; the encroachment of shadows provokes a mortal panic, but the objects that are being expunged often seem to emit a brief, dying glow. Here, on the border between two worlds, the dual allegiances of photographers pull them in opposite directions. Do they lament the loss of the sun, or worship the lunatic goddess described by Weston as 'Lady Moon'? At the V&A, we are enticed into a twilight zone, eased through a rite of passage that leads from diurnal work to nocturnal pleasure, or from alert consciousness to phantasmagoric sleep. The French call twilight 'the blue hour', so the curtained walls have the dim, sedative tint of a soothing cocktail bar; a laminated white floor suggests the lunar surface. Each of the eight photographers on display is given a private annexe, painted dark lilac or lush velvety purple. These are their personal dark rooms, alchemical dens (as the curator Martin Barnes beautifully puts it) in which they work their transforming miracles. Sometimes the space is like a bedroom, housing the elaborate hallucinatory tableaux arranged by Gregory Crewdson. For Philip-Lorca diCorcia, it is closer to an all-night diner, a blearily bright hang-out for nighthawks. In the case of the Ukrainian photographer Boris Mikhailov, the cramped cubicle is a cell, on whose walls are pinned fugitive glimpses of social disintegration and despair in the streets of Kharkov. Mikhailov's version of the bedroom is a foul, filthy dormitory in a derelict barracks, with stained and pitted mattresses on a row of metal beds; the frost-bitten blue tone of his prints is a symptom of poverty, as miserable as the atmosphere of Picasso's 'blue period'. DiCorcia, whose subjects are adolescent hustlers on Santa Monica Boulevard in Los Angeles, interprets twilight as a lapse into indulgence and satiety, the time when fantasy is set free. Mikhailov, however, translates twilight into Wagnerian German by calling his series Die Dammerung. Wagner described the twilight of the gods, who grow old and decline into obsolescence as the shadows thicken around them. In prints that are pinned so low on the walls that you have to crouch near the floor to see them, Mikhailov looks up from puddled gutters and documents the collapse of protective walls and the subsidence of the sky itself. Chrystel Lebas, who photographs trees and shrubs that merge and coagulate at dusk, discovers an even more atavistic meaning in the time of day. Her series is entitled Abyss: this, according to Greek cosmology, was the gulf of indiscriminate non-being which painfully gave birth to our lighted, differentiated world. When the sun withdraws, the clogged forests of Lebas recreate that oblivious condition. The pictorialist photographer Edward Steichen remarked in 1899 that twilight was 'a beautiful hour', when things 'melt into each other'. For Lebas, whose trees condense into an impenetrable palisade as we watch, the loss of distinctness is a kind of death, not a pleasurable deliquescence. This, as Ori Gersht demonstrates in a short film made for the exhibition, is the way the world will end, in a reversion to its beginning. In Gersht's Big Bang, a siren ululates and causes a vase of freeze-dried flowers to shudder and tremble; the glass splinters, the flowers fly apart, and pyrotechnics flare up to announce the expiry of the sun, engulfed all over again by the primal murk. Elsewhere a valiant battle goes on between darkness and light. Crewdson photographs an extra-terrestrial beam that slices through the sky and alights on a drab American suburb: the eye of God, terrifyingly capricious, chooses to focus on this nondescript patch of ground, which becomes the stage for a close encounter between heaven and earth. In Liang Yue's photographs of Beijing, a young man with a torch gropes through a city obscured by fumes and by the storms of grit blown in from the Mongolian desert. The light here is that of the perplexed individual mind, straining to peer into a dubious future, while for American master Robert Adams the evening star, in Blake's words, is a 'bright torch of love', sanctifying whatever it shines on. The Australian photographer Bill Henson sees twilight as a camouflage for shadier assignations. In the darkness of Henson's massive prints, light leaves confidential traces like the slick track of a snail: it shines on a beer bottle that is humid with cold, it glistens on clammy flesh, and it picks out a tear in the corner of a noctambulant character's eye. The same reflected gleam on the trunk of a eucalypt turns a tree into a gesticulating ghost. The show justifies Barnes's alchemical metaphor - except that, while alchemists conspired to manufacture gold, photographers prefer to create silver, as Robert Adams does when he shows how moonlight transfigures a scrappy clump of weeds. But once at least the setting sun genuinely gilds squalid reality. DiCorcia's Texan rent-boy stares through a pane of grubby glass at the cheap pleasures he will buy for himself if he turns a trick: a greasy hamburger wrapped in a napkin, coffee in a plastic cup with the Parthenon imprinted on it, a dented jukebox storing the hits of a defunct decade. He remains excluded, locked out in the street with its noisy battery of jabbering signs. Behind him, however, the sun performs dazzling polychrome tricks as it sinks into the Pacific. It bleaches the sky above the smoggy city, and it burnishes the boy's unkempt hair until he seems, like an angel stranded on the sidewalk, to be wearing a halo. The magic hour is a time of transition, and sometimes of transcendence.  ",

   "input": "FORTUNE 2014 So much for having your own little corner at work. For two decades, companies have been shifting to open workspace designs and eliminating dedicated offices in a twin effort to reduce real estate costs and encourage collaboration between colleagues. But as the per-person square footage of the typical workplace continues to shrink, many workers 2014 and managers 2014 are beginning to wonder whether we 2019ve reached the limit. 201cIn open workspaces, it 2019s hard for people to get their work done if it requires uninterrupted concentration and focus, 201d says Cali Williams Yost, a flexible workplace strategist and author of Tweak It: Make What Matters to You Happen Every Day. 201cPeople who have jobs that require private conversations or uninterrupted thinking really struggle. 201d A majority of employers allocate 150 square feet or less per worker, down dramatically from 225 square feet in 2010, according to a recent survey by CoreNet Global, a professional association for corporate real estate managers. Space per person is likely to continue to shrink, with 58% of companies expecting to increase employment in the next year. A whopping 81% of companies surveyed have already adopted an open-space floor plan. MORE: Maybe Apple 2019s Tim Cook knows what he 2019s doing after all Assigned space is unused 50% of the time, says Richard Kadzis, CoreNet 2019s vice president for strategic communications. And cutting out that space can benefit a company 2019s balance sheet. AT&T T eliminated offices and consolidated workspace with savings of $3,000 per office for a total of $550 million per year, according to a General Services Administration report. Nortel 2019s NTL telecommuting program saves $20 million a year in real estate, the equivalent of two 20-story office buildings with 40,000 square feet per floor. But creating a decent workspace isn 2019t as simple as tearing out office doors and putting in long rows of benches where employees can connect laptops, or putting in place a hoteling system for people to reserve space on an as-needed basis. Done right, an open floor-plan office will include strategically placed quiet rooms for 201cheads down 201d work, huddle rooms for small meetings or impromptu discussions, larger conference rooms, and social areas where all that collaboration and innovation can take place. There should also be access to plants and natural light, whether through windows, skylights or creative use of atriums. Noise is often the most ignored factor in open design, says Kadzis. Acoustical engineers can do remarkable things with white noise and noise-absorbing materials, but they must be part of the design team. That group should also include executives from technology, environmental sustainability, human resources, and facilities management. When editor Susan R. Paisner worked for a Washington, D.C. trade association, only 10 directors had dedicated offices, and the remaining 80 staffers shared one big open space divided into cubicles. 201cIt was difficult for me because I was frequently being told to be quieter, 201d Paisner recalls. 201cIt was a very frustrating, difficult environment to work in. 201d There were a few small conference rooms in the office, but they were often booked. Once, a challenging issue arose, and she wanted to immediately sit down and speak privately with her staff, but they had to check every private space on the floor before finding one that was available. MORE: From Hooters Girl to the corner office Employers also need to integrate telecommuting and flexible work programs when they open these new workspaces, so managers and employees can match the type of work that needs to happen with the spaces and times that are available. For instance, someone who needs to concentrate on a large project should be able to shift her hours to come in before the office is noisy or work from home until she 2019s met her deadline, Yost says. And employees need training to learn to manage where, when, and how they should work. For anyone thinking that the challenges are greater than the benefits of open workspaces, you 2019ve got plenty of company. Even some real estate professionals believe that companies are over-building collaborative space at the expense of privacy and focus work 2014 31% agreed with that statement in CoreNet 2019s survey. But the cost savings are quite powerful. 201cOpen workspaces are not going away, 201d predicts Yost. 201cCompanies are going to take this as far as they can to save the overhead. 201d  ",

   "input": "Unilever hadn 2019t grown significantly in years when the board brought in Paul Polman from Nestl 00e9 as CEO in 2009. Despite the recession, he sparked rapid growth and record profits, focusing especially on emerging markets, where the company has found opportunity selling its household products in tiny quantities at prices of 10 00a2 to 15 00a2. Of its 400-plus brands, those with annual revenues over 1 billion euros include Dove, Lipton, Lux, and Hellmann 2019s (recently embroiled in a tempest in a jar over the exact meaning of 201cmayo 201d; see Fortune.com). Polman,58, has attracted wide praise for putting environmental and social goals prominently at the center of Unilever 2019s strategy 2014and making it pay. He talked recently with Fortune about audacious goals, attracting young employees, and more: We 2019re seeing signs of a global economic slowdown. You have two billion customers around the world. What are they telling you? There are some forces coming together that we 2019re all struggling with. Clearly, the money that we 2019ve pumped in since the 2008 2013 2009 crisis has not given us the growth. If anything, it has made a few people richer but with a lot of people excluded. You see that in the U.S., and you see it in Europe. Markets are stable or down, if you look at the broad consumer market. And then the developing markets have seen a significant slowdown over the last year or two. And so we see a global economy that used to grow at 4% or 5% levels, and it probably is now growing at 2% or 3% levels. The latest forecast from the IMF and OECD is 3.1%. And any forecast is coming down. So we have to be realistic now. And that forecast is your expectation, too, I gather. We 2019ve always warned for that, and often have been called pessimists, but it 2019s better to be a realist, and that 2019s what we 2019re trying to be. It 2019s almost five years now since you announced a goal of doubling the size of the company while reducing its environmental footprint. Is that still looking feasible? It was indeed an audacious goal, but I always believed it was more of a mindset issue. One of our goals is sustainably sourcing all our agricultural materials. We were at 10% and were seen as one of the more forward-looking companies, always No. 1 in the Dow Jones sustainability index. Now we 2019re at 50%. It took us 150 years to get to 10% and four years to get to four times higher. If you set these audacious goals, you get people out of a comfort zone, that makes them do amazing things. That goal caused quite a stir inside and outside the company when you announced it. What have you learned since then about the effects of doing something that big? If you set more audacious goals, and you get people out of their comfort zone, the first thing you have to realize is that people are actually capable of doing more than we all thought possible. We 2019ve all learned a lot. Also that you can run a business and make a positive contribution to society. There doesn 2019t need to be a tradeoff. I think the crisis in 2008 2013 2009 has made many people realize that the economic progress that we had seen has been tremendous, has lifted many people out of poverty, but has also come at an enormous price 2014 enormous levels of government and private debt, enormous levels of overconsumption, and frankly, leaving too many people behind. In this increasingly connected world, you see more and more people able to aggregate their forces and make their displeasure known. That 2019s one of the reasons why we have significantly more geopolitical conflicts now. Businesses are under the same scrutiny as governments, and so if you want to be successful in tomorrow 2019s world, you have to reach a higher level of trust, which requires more transparency. You have to make positive contributions to issues like climate change, food security, and unemployment. The U.N. Foundation just gave you its Champion for Global Change Award. Can the U.N. be helpful in reaching some of these goals? The U.N. is increasingly important. Obviously, the tragic Ebola crisis is one of the examples where people from the U.N. are doing heroic work. But what you basically see is that the political system which we created to rule the world dates back to Bretton Woods, and it 2019s not really functioning anymore as well as it should. One of the reasons you see these geopolitical conflicts is because many politicians have a hard time internalizing these global challenges to their own constituents, and the U.N. is playing an enormous role there to keep a global moral framework that we can all at least aspire to. The U.N. put out the original millennium development goals, which had as a simple objective to halve the number of people living in poverty, which at that time was defined as $7.25 a day or less, and we 2019ve actually achieved that goal over the last 15 years. And one of the reasons we 2019ve achieved that is because of this moral framework that the U.N. put out that has served as a beacon for many governments, companies, and other institutions. Now there are opportunities to make the U.N. work better, and that is why we as companies via the U.N. Global Compact and other institutions try to be part of that. It doesn 2019t serve anything to criticize if you don 2019t want to be part of the solution. You 2019ve said you 2019re simplifying Unilever. How do you simplify a company that 2019s in 190 countries? You do it with good people. People are driven by an enormous level of energy if the purpose is high. People really want to make a bigger difference to life than just growing market share or improving profits. We 2019re showing that you can do that while at the same time satisfying your shareholders. For example, Lifebuoy is one of our hand-washing soaps. It 2019s growing at double digits because it really is helping children [in emerging markets] reach the age of 5, through the simple act of hand washing. That unleashes enormous energy. If you bring these strong purposes to your brands, it actually makes the brands more relevant, because what you have to watch in a big company like this is that you don 2019t fall in love with yourself and become too internally focused. If you can move that purpose outside of the company, outside of your own interests, and put the interests of society first, which actually should be the purpose of any company, then I think you unlock that energy. You 2019re investing more in leadership development and have opened a new center in Singapore aimed at that goal. What 2019s the larger human capital strategy? My job really is not really to hit the numbers every quarter and be a hero, because that 2019s actually easy to do. My job is to be sure that this company is even stronger than what I inherited and can last for many hundreds of years more. One of the most important things is to invest in human capital. So one of the key things I look at is, Are we a desired employer or not? That 2019s very important to me. On LinkedIn we 2019ve become the third-most-looked-up company after Google and Apple, which is actually quite amazing because Unilever is not really a brand in itself. The company is very much in demand, especially among young people. When you came to the company, you were an outsider CEO who changed the strategy. What did you learn about how to make changes of that magnitude in a global enterprise? Probably anybody in my position would have made the same changes, because a lot of things in the world were changing that our predecessors did not have to deal with. The growth of the East, the enormous speed of the digitization of society. Because of economic growth, the pressures on the planetary boundaries 2014 these are all factors coming together in these past 10 or 15 years and putting pressure on businesses and requiring businesses to change. Are we the ones that have that ultimate wisdom to do that better than anybody else? I don 2019t think so. And my job really has been to, first of all, understand the values that make this company work and be successful over the last 150 years. Having come in as an outsider, I spent enormous amounts of time understanding what works in this company. It has always been a company that is driven by doing good, from its early days under Lord Lever. Throughout its history, you see that. We 2019ve just been able to capture it and link it to our business growth. My job is probably the simplest in the company, believe it or not, because it 2019s really focused on trying to make everybody else successful. And then you see what this enormous energy is that you can unleash. The strategy changes are probably the least important changes. It 2019s just bringing this company back to the core of what made it successful in the first place. This story is from the December 22, 2014 issue of Fortune.  ",

After all, unlike the sell-side analysts who are telling investors to buy the stock, they don 2019t have clients who will be angry and disappointed if the company doesn 2019t exceed expectations.

In percentage terms, the gap between their EPS estimates 2014 nearly $1 2014 was even larger: a whopping 18%. The prize for most bullish estimate goes to Dennis Hildebrand of Apple 2019s Gold, an amateur with a mixed track record who is predicting earnings of $6.61 on revenues of $27.8 billion. The most conservative estimate comes, ironically, from Needham 2019s Charlie Wolf, a long-time Apple bull. Wolf, who 2019s calling for earnings of $4.93 on revenues of $23.01 billion, tends to come in on the low side. He explained in a private e-mail that he rarely changes the numbers he files immediately after each quarterly earnings report, and he bases his calculations on Apple 2019s (invariably conservative) gross margin guidance.

   "input": "The girls sit around the studio, posing and smoking. They stand to be painted, in big hats or holding fans. Kirchner paints them lipsticked, alluring, dismissive, naked. He curdles them in palette-knifings and clotted brushstrokes and a sour fauve colour. He paints them fast, and draws them even faster. He even draws himself, naked and dancing, on a postcard, in a sort of delirium. He draws couples having sex, a woman crouching naked as though to piss, smiling over her shoulder. He runs through styles and poses. Looking at Kirchner, you think of the artists he has looked at (Cranach, Van Gogh, Gr 00fcnewald, D 00fcrer, Gauguin, Matisse) and the artists who have looked at him (Francis Bacon, Georg Bazelitz). In art, there are always these cycles of influence. Studios are filled with the ghosts of the past and premonitions of the future. Ernst Ludwig Kirchner was a founder, in 1905, of Die Br 00fccke (The Bridge), a group that also included Schmidt-Rotluff, Heckel and, later, Emil Nolde. This Royal Academy exhibition, Kirchner: Expressionism and the City, is as good an introduction to the artist as we are likely to see. Covering the Dresden period of Die Br 00fccke and Kirchner's subsequent years, up to 1918, in Berlin, it brings together some tremendous paintings, a small selection of sculptures and many prints and drawings, as well as a number of informative, slightly alarming photographs taken in Kirchner's studio. On my way to the show I met an Academician. How is the Kirchner? I asked. Quite nice , she replied. Kirchner - the absinthe-addled expressionist , a man who drew himself in the grip of a morphine fit; who, feigning madness to get himself out of the German army in the first world war, suffered a breakdown and spent months shuttling from sanatorium to sanatorium - quite nice? By 1918 Kirchner was a physical and nervous wreck, a burned-out case who had to put himself back together again (but, perhaps, never quite did). The National Socialists went on to brand him a degenerate, and there are still Brits who condemn him to a polite mediocrity. Little wonder he eventually shot himself, in 1938. Perhaps people mistake Kirchner's bright colour for brightness of temperament. Or his rapid, cursive drawing, with its scribbly paroxysms and flourishes, for a quickness and lightness of mind as well as eye. Or those juddering angularities, the anatomical twists and perspectival distortions in his paintings, for a kind of energised mental vim and bounce. The high-heeled nudes in the studio, the dancers and circus acrobats, the pensive girls who seem so aware of being looked at - they might all be taken as celebrations of sexually liberated, attractively louche and laid-back bohemian life. But there is something forced and desperate there, too. The frolicking in the wavesmay evoke some kind of misapprehended primitive idyll (and take us back as much to C 00e9zanne's Bathers as to Gauguin on Tahiti) , but there is something awry with the whole idea. There always was. Some of the claims made on his behalf - that, for example, his greatest achievements were his woodcut prints, or that he was better than the fauves (like Matisse) because he was less decorative - I find difficult to take seriously. One essay in the catalogue, by Louis de Marsalle, is full of praise for Kirchner's drawings and graphic pieces: they are possibly the purest and loveliest of his works. They are without conscious design and intent; they mirror the sensations of a man of our time. Discovering that De Marsalle was a pseudonym for Kirchner himself makes us wonder about the man. According to Picasso's biographer , John Richardson, Kirchner falsified the dates on certain of his paintings to prove that it was the painters of Die Br 00fccke - and not Picasso, Matisse or the fauves - who first discovered African tribal art and what was unhappily termed primitivism. Kirchner wasn't the only artist to redate paintings for the sake of his own eminence (Arshile Gorky did , too), and though you might question what exactly was going on in Dresden in the 20th century's first decade, Kirchner's action doesn't change his paintings. They are what they are. Matisse's influence on Kirchner is unavoidable. There is a little drawing in the show called Milli Telling a Story, which is Matissean but somehow more wonky, less facile, than Matisse. This kind of thing endears me to Kirchner: when things seem to go wrong, they are wrong in the right way; they are individual and memorable. And his quotes - moments from a Gauguin, or a memory of Munch's famous painting Puberty, or a subject and a pose lifted from Lucas Cranach - become in Kirchner his own. They may be raw, but they are digested and assimilated rather than borrowed wholesale. Kirchner's troubles are the stuff of cliche: the artist as tragic and self-destructive hero, the artist as outsider, or as tortured genius. But the work itself is not cliched. The Artillery-men in the Shower (1915), that self-conscious, crude group under the jets, barked at by a uniformed officer, is a scary essay in the de-individualised group. His Berlin street scenes - with their hookers and flneurs, the emptiness of the crossing at Innsbruck Street, the green-tinged light and the trams on Nollendorf Square - make the viewer feel as vulnerable and inconsequential as the naked young men in that shower. These are terribly affecting paintings. Nevertheless, I don't think Kirchner is quite the protean force - painter, printmaker, sculptor, generative artist - that he is made out to be by his champions. A troubled artist and a troubling man, he remains difficult for us. The Royal Academy show spares us what is seen as his decline: his years in Switzerland; his gathering reputation coupled with his own unhappy revisions and eventual dismissal of his early work; his confused retreat. He shot himself while vacillating over his forthcoming marriage, his will, we are told, having deserted him. We might also have trouble with some of his subject matter, and what his art says about the mores of his age. But Kirchner could not have done a thing about that. As he told us, via De Marsalle, he was a man of his own time. Perhaps we shall be looked back on with just as much resistance, with as little or as much sympathy as is our due. 00b7 Kirchner: Expressionism and the City is at the Royal Academy, London W1, until September 21.

   "input": "The founders of Boston 2019s Third Rock Ventures turned heads in the venture capital world when they managed to launch three of their small life sciences businesses onto the public stock market over just three months in 2013. The success of the popular initial public offerings 2014 for bluebird bio Inc., Agios Pharmaceuticals Inc., and Foundation Medicine Inc. 2014 are only part of the story. Business developments at those companies since they went public and the surging value of all three stocks are startling. The three companies now have a combined stock market value of more than $8 billion, their shares outpacing other life sciences stocks by a great deal. Shares of Agios, which focuses on cancer therapies, have soared 528 percent since going public. The company 2019s IPO raised $120 million, but the popularity of its stock allowed Agios to collect $350 million more in two secondary offerings last year. Bluebird 2019s stock has spiked by 439 percent since its IPO, and it had two additional stock offerings that raised $376 million. The company is focusing on gene therapies for a variety of diseases. Foundation Medicine 2019s stock is up 160 percent since the cancer diagnostics company 2019s IPO. It struck a deal last month to sell a little more than half of the company for over $1 billion to the drug giant Roche Holding AG. More on all three companies in a minute. The story of the venture firm that helped them grow is just as interesting. The founders of Third Rock aren 2019t exactly old hands at the venture business. Kevin Starr, Robert Tepper, and Mark Levin, all former executives of Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc., were hanging out in 2006 at a Las Vegas casino, of all places, when they decided to go into venture capital. They formed Third Rock the next year. 201cWe 2019re more serial company start-up people than we are investors, 201d said Starr. The founders had spent their careers 201cbuilding companies or working at the bench, 201d he said. They saw a confluence of life sciences business trends creating a remarkable opportunity in venture capital at the time. As Starr tells it, big drug companies were preoccupied with their equally big business problems and ignoring early-stage life sciences companies as investment opportunities. Money for those companies was hard to come by. 201cWe were in the middle of a lost decade for scientific innovation, 201d said Starr. He meant the funding of new ideas. Actual life sciences innovation 2014 in academic labs and medical centers 2014 was exploding. New technology in fields such as big data, next-generation tools, and robotics was making it possible for life sciences companies to advance ideas at dramatically faster speeds. 201cWhen we walked around the halls of academia, we thought we were in the middle of the greatest innovation era of our lifetime, 201d Starr said. Levin, Tepper, and Starr believed there would be a huge appetite for new drugs and other medical products. The Third Rock founders also thought investors would reward companies that could demonstrate real progress 2014 though even they would admit the stock prices of their star companies have outstripped Third Rock 2019s early expectations. A few qualifiers are in order here. Third Rock is certainly not the only Massachusetts venture firm focused on plowing money into life sciences businesses today. And ground-shaking results are hardly a given. Third Rock has invested in 37 businesses since 2007. But the outsized success of Third Rock 2019s IPO class of 2013 supports many of the ideas behind the firm 2019s process. Most important, they demonstrated how documented progress on the treatment of diseases will be rewarded in financial markets. Agios has shown striking results in relatively small numbers of cancer patients so far. The company 2019s treatment doesn 2019t destroy cancer cells; it reprograms them to become functional again. Some patients gained no benefit, but many showed improvement and even remission. Bluebird has been targeting a rare children 2019s blood disorder as the first commercial application of its gene therapy. On Monday, the Food and Drug Administration gave the bluebird process a 201cbreakthrough therapy 201d designation. Foundation Medicine 2019s stock performance had not been particularly impressive until Roche, the world 2019s largest producer of cancer drugs, struck a deal in January to acquire a majority of the company. The shares more than doubled immediately after that, based on the drug giant 2019s apparent confidence in Foundation Medicine 2019s technology. Venture capital of all kinds is a risky business. Building a company around a medical therapy is an uphill battle. But new technologies and tools really do make many more things possible. And the rewards speak for themselves.  ",

   "input": "For all the talk of shrinking global defense budgets and sequestration, the U.S. military 2019s three prime combat aircraft contractors 2014Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Northrop Grumman 2014have enjoyed a good run of late, with each company 2019s stock currently bumping up against its 52-week high. But don 2019t expect the smooth sailing to last, says one prominent industry analyst. A U.S. Air Force contract set to be awarded this summer is set to upend the status quo, likely leading to a major move by one of the top three contractors to acquire a piece of another, says Richard Aboulafia, vice president for analysis at aerospace and defense consultancy Teal Group. In other words, if you only pay attention to one thing in the defense space this year, keep a watchful eye on the Pentagon 2019s Long Range Strike-Bomber (LRS-B) decision. If you 2019ve never heard of the Air Force 2019s long range strike-bomber, that 2019s by design. The super-secretive program has been on the flying branch 2019s wish list for years, though details surrounding the aircraft and its potential design remain scarce even as the Pentagon wants to spend $100 billion dollars on it. The program will produce 80 to 100 aircraft (at roughly $550 million per copy), replacing the Air Force 2019s legacy fleet of B-52 and B-1 bombers with a stealthy, long-range, nuke-capable strike aircraft entering service around 2020. A program so big and so central to the USAF 2019s core competencies will shape America 2019s military aerospace priorities for the next two decades at least. But its impact will become immediately apparent this summer when the Air Force decides whether Northrop Grumman NOC or a collaboration between Boeing and Lockheed Martin will ultimately build and maintain its LRS-B fleet, Aboulafia says. With no other major combat airframe contract on the horizon and work on existing contracts running out, the loser of the competition will have to gracefully exit the combat aircraft business or make a big move to stay relevant. Lockheed Martin LMT , with the $400 billion F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program in its back pocket, can withstand the loss of the LRS-B contract. But between Northrop Grumman and Boeing BA something 2019s got to give, Aboulafia says. Northrop Grumman 2019s last prime aircraft contract was for the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber, which entered service more than a decade ago (only 21 of the aircraft were built). Boeing 2019s only existing combat jet assembly line will cease production in 2018 unless it finds a new buyer for its F-18 or F-15 fighter jets. 201cThe broader problem is that two of the three are running out of work, 201d Aboulafia tells Fortune. 201cThere 2019s nothing wrong with Northrop Grumman or Boeing as companies, but Northrop Grumman hasn 2019t built a new military aircraft in many years, and Boeing 2019s legacy military aircraft will end production by the end of this decade. So this becomes make or break, basically. 201d That could prompt some interesting movement in the defense aerospace sector before the year is out. The initiative 2014and the opportunity 2014really belong to Boeing in this case. If the Boeing-Lockheed team wins the LRS-B contract, Northrop Grumman could survive as-is, buoyed by its various strong technology units that produce everything from electronic warfare components to radars to unmanned reconnaissance drones. But with its days as a combat aircraft prime contractor behind it and no new contracts on the horizon, it would almost certainly sell off its aircraft unit, Aboulafia says, and Boeing would be the obvious and eager buyer. In doing so, the company might also come under pressure to sell off other units, and Northrop Grumman could come out of the tumult looking like a very different company. 201cInvestors might say 2018look, you 2019re not going to be a combat airframe prime again, you 2019re worth less than the sum of your parts, 2019 201d Aboulafia says. If Northrop Grumman wins the LRS-B contract, the outcome might not be all that different. In an effort to keep its combat airframe business alive, the much larger Boeing could make a play for Northrop Grumman 2019s combat airframe business and the LRS-B contract along with it. In any case, one of the Pentagon 2019s top three combat jet primes will most likely be out of the combat jet business, Aboulafia says. Implications for shareholders notwithstanding, such a merger or acquisition could create philosophical problems for the Pentagon, which has in recent years discouraged blockbuster mergers and acquisitions that reduce competition in the space. Ash Carter, the new U.S. Secretary of Defense 2014and, notably, the former chief of technology acquisition at the Pentagon 2014has been both a supporter of the LRS-B program and vocally critical of mergers that reduce the Pentagon 2019s technological talent pool. In written answers to questions submitted to the Senate Armed Services Committee prior to his confirmation hearing earlier this month, Carter said he would support policies that preserve competition in the defense industry, warning against 201cconsolidations that eliminate competition or cause market distortions that are not in the department 2019s best interest. 201d It 2019s tough to square those competing interests when the LRS-B contract is the only game in town. When the Air Force hands down its decision this summer, someone will undoubtedly be left holding the bag, Aboulafia says, and the Pentagon can 2019t will its contractors into keeping production lines and design shops open without providing paid work for them to do. That makes the LRS-B contract as impactful for the military aerospace industry as any Pentagon spending decision handed down in recent memory. 201cThere 2019s one big competition and that 2019s going to determine everything, 201d Aboulafia says. 201cThat 2019s the market. 201d  ",

   "input": "Shell 2019s big bet on liquefied natural gas (LNG) is far from a sure thing. It is LNG, not oil, that 2019s truly behind the European energy giant 2019s $70 billion acquisition of Britain 2019s BG Group, which was announced on Wednesday. Together, the two firms would control a significant amount of the world 2019s LNG supply, besting rival ExxonMobil by a considerable margin. But while being bigger is usually better in the energy world, it may not pay off as well when it comes to the volatile and niche LNG marketplace. LNG suppliers used to have the upper hand, but that advantage has degraded sharply over the last few years as demand growth has waned. Contract terms are now shorter and less lucrative for suppliers. To make matters worse, rising construction and maintenance costs have made LNG imports less appealing to many customers, all while continued tepid demand is causing supply to build up. This doesn 2019t bode well for the new king of LNG. Prolonged weak oil prices usually leads to consolidation in the energy industry. Bigger and better capitalized firms tend to gobble up smaller and weaker ones at a price relative to where they believe oil prices will end up once the market recovers (whenever, or wherever, that may be). But Shell 2019s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, told reporters on Wednesday that his company 2019s decision to acquire rival BG Group was 201cnot a bet on the oil price. 201d Instead, he insisted, the deal was centered on creating a stronger company in both oil and natural gas. The key word here is gas, more specifically, liquefied natural gas, or LNG, which is basically natural gas compressed and chilled into a liquid, allowing it to be transported by sea to destinations far away. Shell has bet big on LNG over the years and believes in its growth potential. Countries such as Japan and Korea, which can 2019t receive natural gas via pipeline, depend on LNG for all their gas needs. Shell has major investments in Australia and the Middle East and owns and leases around 40 LNG tankers, including the Prelude liquefaction ship, which is the largest ship ever built. BG Group has invested in LNG as well, with projects in Egypt, Trinidad, and Australia and a fleet of around 25 owned and leased LNG carriers. BG also has an agreement with Cheniere LNG to purchase 3.5 million tonnes per annum ( 201cmtpa 201d) of LNG from the U.S. Gulf Coast. Together, Shell and BG are expected to produce as much as 33 mtpa of LNG this year. That 2019s equivalent to around 14% of global LNG imports for 2014. ExxonMobil, the largest of the energy 201csupermajors, 201d is slated to produce 22 mtpa. By 2018, after new projects under construction get rolling, the Shell-BG combo will pump an impressive 45 mtpa of LNG, which is equivalent to around 19% of 2014 global LNG imports. So, this deal seems pretty much centered on gaining and protecting market share. Shell wants to be the undisputed leader in LNG. But is that wise? While LNG can be an extremely profitable venture, it can also turn out to be a total money-sucking disaster. The LNG market has gone from a seller 2019s market to a buyer 2019s market over the years. This is only going to get worse as supply increases. To be sure, Shell is no novice in this space. The company assisted in building the first LNG gasification terminal in Algeria in the 1960s, so it has been in the LNG business from the very beginning. But Shell 2019s experience may actually be a liability in this case. The LNG market today is very different than it was just a few years ago. In the past, Shell and other LNG suppliers could force its customers to sign long-term agreements known as take-or-pay contracts. Under these deals, Shell 2019s clients, usually a Japanese or Korean utility, would agree to take a specified amount of LNG per month for a long time, usually 20 years, and agree to pay the market price to the supplier even if it didn 2019t necessarily want or need the gas that second. The price of LNG is dynamic and has usually moved with the price of oil, which is used for totally different applications. This became a major problem in the 2000s, as oil and natural gas prices diverged significantly. In some cases, LNG was being sold to customers, mostly in Asia, at a rate that was as much as six to 10 times what natural gas was being sold for in the United States. Eventually, everyone wanted in on this racket, leading to an explosion of gasification projects all around the world, from Malaysia to Qatar to even Peru. As the supply of LNG has crept up over the years, the power of suppliers has waned. With LNG demand growth slowing in Asia, which soaks up 75% of LNG imports, the market has become less favorable to sellers. In response, sellers are now demanding shorter commitments, averaging four years instead of 20, and a more rational pricing structure based on the supply and demand dynamics of the natural gas market, not the oil market. This means that many of the LNG gasification projects Shell has been developing for years, such as the Gorgon LNG project in northwestern Australia or the Sakhalin 2 LNG project in Siberia, may end up not being as lucrative as originally imagined. Sellers are also choosing to resell gas they don 2019t need via a newly developing LNG spot market, where prices can differ wildly from contracted prices, much of the time far lower. A record 70 mtpa of LNG was traded on a spot or short-term basis in 2014, equating to 29% of its total global trade. A competitive spot market for LNG might work to the advantage of certain suppliers, but it could also backfire if there is too much supply on the market at any given moment. Suppliers desperate to move errant cargo of LNG will be forced to sell it at a discount, which could have a profound impact on the entire market. The spot LNG cargo hasn 2019t been too disruptive over the last few years, though, given the extraordinary demand for surplus LNG from Japan. The country needed the extra LNG to make up for energy lost from its downed nuclear reactors in the wake of the Fukushima incident in 2011. But Japan no longer needs all that extra LNG due to its weak economy and the potential restart of its nuclear plants. That not only means that it will be much harder for spot cargoes to find a home but also means contract prices for LNG bound for Japan will also suffer, falling as much as 38% through 2016, according to Australia & New Zealand Banking Group. Having extra LNG floating around in the market would have been unheard of just a few years ago, but it will become more common in the near future. This is because LNG gasification terminals are being built on spec. Nowhere is this better illustrated than in Australia, where both Shell and BG have large LNG interests. An estimated 11 mtpa of LNG production capacity under construction is unspoken for, according to Tri-Zen, a consultancy. Such a huge amount of LNG without a home is alarming and could move the overall LNG market to the downside. China is expected to absorb a lot of the LNG set to come online in the next few years. The country has a number of regasification terminals under construction to receive the LNG shipments, much of which is expected to come from Australia. But unlike Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, which have no choice but to use LNG for its gas needs, China has options. Not only does China have its own domestic natural gas production, it also can easily receive natural gas from producers via pipeline. For example, Russia announced last year that it had inked a deal with China to deliver $400 billion worth of natural gas over the next 30 years. If China can receive billions of dollars 2019 worth of Russia gas through a pipeline at a fraction of the cost of LNG, then it is unlikely that China will want to expand its LNG intake capacity beyond what 2019s currently on the books. With China out of the mix, suppliers have a big problem. As more capacity is turned on, a price war could break out, causing LNG prices to sink like a rock. While that might be great news to consumers in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, it doesn 2019t bode well for Shell 2019s acquisition of BG Group.  ",

The ban was issued after the English-language newspaper printed a report by its Arab affairs editor, Anan Safadi, asserting that President Anwar el-Sadat was involved in a power struggle with Vice President Hosni Mubarak and that a Government shuffle was imminent. ''We cannot accept any attempts to distort the facts of Egyptian life,'' the Egyptian information official said in a statement published in all Cairo's Arabic and foreign language dailies. The Israeli Ambassador, Eliahu Ben Elissar, and Mr. Hassan denied The Jerusalem Post's report, which the Egyptian papers called ''lies and baseless allegations.'' Talks Called 'Constructive' An Israeli Embassy spokesman described the hourlong meeting between Mr. Ben Elissar and Mr. Hassan, convened at Egypt's reguest, as ''warm, friendly, and constructive.'' He said that Mr. Hassan had stressed ''Egypt's disappointment with the story.'' Both Mr. Ben Elissar and Mr. Hassan, he said, ''agreed on the right ways to handle this issue, with the aim of lifting the prohibition imposed on the journalists.''

   "input": "Any Mozart discovery is automatically important. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was, after all, one of the supreme musical minds. Thus the newly discovered symphony in F major, even though it is a juvenile work, will add to the picture of the young composer's development. When Mozart wrote this symphony he was in London with his sister, Nannerl. She was almost as talented a keyboard player as he was, and Leopold, their father, made a European tour with both prodigies. In England, young Mozart attracted the attention of King George III, and played for him, which meant that all society's doors were open to the Mozart family. Among the musicians resident in England was Johann Christian Bach, the youngest surviving son of the great Johann Sebastian. Johann Christian was known as ''the London Bach,'' and was immensely successful there as keyboard virtuoso and composer. The famous Bach took a keen interest in the young Mozart. It is not known if Bach ever gave any lessons to Wolfgang, but it is a matter of record that the master and the child improvised together on the clavier, and that the two developed a warm personal relationship. Scholars have demonstrated that Mozart's earliest concertos and symphonies were strongly influenced by the music of Johann Christian Bach. Written in 'Galant' Style Judging from photographs of the violin part of the newly discovered symphony, it is written in the then standard ''galant'' style. The galant style was a breakaway from the contrapuntal style of Baroque music. It was characterized by graceful, Italian-derived melodies, relatively simple accompaniments, and harmonies that seldom departed from the home key. It was music intended to please, and it never struck very deep; rather, it was graceful, light and entertaining. Johann Christian Bach was one of the early exponents of the galant style, and the youthful Mozart symphony is in that manner. Thus still another Johann Christian Bach influence on the young Mozart has come to life. The existence of the symphony up to now has been known only by a few measures. Several fragments have come down among the manuscripts of Mozart's father. The Breitkopf publishing firm, established in 1719, listed the music as ''lost.'' Mozart a Late Developer It might be mentioned that Mozart, one of the greatest musical prodigies in history (his only two rivals could have been Mendelssohn and Saint-Saens) was a surprisingly late developer. Mendelssohn, for instance, composed his great Octet at 16 and his greater ''Midsummers Night Dream'' Overture at 17. Mozart at that age had nothing comparable to show. It was not until Mozart was 21, in 1777, that he composed the E flat Piano Concerto (K. 271) and that started Mozart writing masterpiece after masterpiece.  ",

   "input": "The question, with its combination of pride and insecurity, sounds like Mayor Koch's ''How am I doing?'' ''So,'' asks Dave Winfield, ''can I play?'' To date, the answer is a resounding 'yes.' Going into last night's game against Seattle, which the Yankees won, 7-5, Winfield, the latest of the Yankees' million-dollar free agents, was leading the team in several offensive categories, had excelled defensively in left field and as a recent substitute in center field, and was the team's most consistent performer. After pressing in spring training, something he did not admit until the exhibition season was over, Winfield has settled into his niche on the Yankees as well, or better, than any of the free agents who preceded him. With reporters, fans and possibly even his teammates watching for him to fail, Winfield has proved himself a player of unusual skill and pleasant disposition. ''I started off on the right foot,'' he said. ''Even if I only do one or two things every day, it's better than having a big game once every two weeks. In spring training nobody knew what I could do. They saw flashes and they assumed that the scouting reports were right, that I was inconsistent. No way. Heck, I can play.'' Statistics Tell the Tale Winfield's judgment of himself is supported by statistics. He has hit safely in 26 of the 32 games he has played. He is leading the Yankees in batting (.345), runs scored (17), hits (39), runs batted in (22) and doubles (9). He is among the league leaders in nine offensive categories. Often his accomplishments are inconspicuous, but no less valuable to the team. Against the Oakland A's last Thursday night, Winfield's scarifice fly drove in the tiebreaking run in the eighth inning of a 9-5 victory. In Seattle last weekend, he scored from first base on Reggie Jackson's double to shallow right field. In the only game he has not started this year, two weeks ago in Oakland, he drove in a run with a pinch single. Last month, on the day he hit his first home run as a Yankee, he also made a superb diving catch in left field with the bases loaded and the Tigers threatening to take the lead. Winfield has been pleased with his swing all season. ''My average doesn't reflect how well I've been hitting the ball,'' he said on one of those nights when hard shots produced outs and bloops produced singles. ''In the long run, I'll get both. Getting on base is the name of the game.'' When Winfield arrived in New York, he made the switch from right field, his position in San Diego, to left field without complaint, even though he is acknowledged as a better defensive player than Jackson. Last week, with Jerry Mumphrey out of the lineup with a leg injury, Winfield filled in adequately in center field. ''I don't like it all the time,'' he said of his temporary position, ''but when it helps, it's logical, and I can play it.'' He's Enjoying Himself In addition to skill and steadiness, Winfield, at age 29, exudes a child-like joy in playing and in his own celebrity. He has a contagious, gap-toothed smile, like Magic Johnson's, that television camera men have learned to zoom in on after he reaches base on a hit or makes an especially satisfying catch. ''Hey,'' Winfield said. ''I'm having a good time.'' He even seems to enjoy the constant jokes, some of them caustic, about his lucrative contract, which is for 10 years and worth more than $20 million. At a recent road game, he noted a sign in the outfield bleachers that read, ''Hey Dave, can you spare a dime?'' and laughed heartily. He carries a cardboard sign that says ''Press Conference Here,'' and feigns disappointment when he is not in enough demand to warrant hanging it at his locker. Two weeks ago, when Billy Martin, the A's manager, said that Winfield had ''the softest bat I've ever seen for a guy 6-8,'' Winfield could hardly wait to respond, then complained that the verbal skirmish was not reported in every hamlet in America. Although Winfield's good nature has not been tested by a personal slump, he has not sulked after Yankee losses. After a dispiriting defeat in Oakland, he was one of only a few New York players who signed autographs on the way to the bus. As Winfield climbed aboard, he recognized the driver from his National League visits to San Francisco. ''You do both sides of the Bay, huh?'' Winfield asked the surprised and flattered man. The demands on his time are prodigious. Before Friday night's rained-out game against Seattle, Winfield conducted several lengthy interviews, taped a television commercial for a telethon for the Roberto Clemente Sports City in Puerto Rico, and posed for photographs with the four children of a slain New York City policeman. Finally, with the sky darkening and only a few minutes of fielding practice left, Winfield grabbed his glove and said, ''I'll see everybody when I get back,'' and trotted out to center field, smiling all the way.

   "input": "EDINBURGH, Aug. 29 2014 The 35th Edinburgh Festival, an ever-expanding celebration of the arts, will come to a close Saturday, more successful than many of its predecessors by statistical, if not artistic, measures. Begun in 1947 as a self-described ''gesture of cultural defiance in a world made weary by war, misery and destruction,'' the festival has since grown to a three-week-long cultural institution far broader in scope than its founders imagined. This year, the official festival is offering 164 performances - largely of opera, theater and music - and appears likely to sell about 80 percent of the 171,811 tickets available. Some 100,000 visitors are expected to elbow their way through this crowded Scottish city where nearly all shop windows are designed to capitalize on their arrival. But perhaps most imposing has been the growth in the panoply of related events that swirl around the official festival, notably a ''fringe festival,'' a collection of 454 companies, 739 shows and 8,868 often bizarre performances. Among the most talked-about such occurrences this year have been a production of ''2001'' performed in the back of a Hillman Avenger automobile to an audience of two per performance, a revue put on in a hotel's checked baggage room and Acme Acting, which performs an individually selected production at the customer's choice of location. ''Demand and supply are rarely so directly related in the arts,'' said Alistair Moffat, the administrator of the Festival Fringe Society, which publishes a program but does not regulate the fringe productions. The vibrance of the fringe had to some extent overshadowed the official festival, which does not seek a place on the international artistic cutting edge, but rather tries to attract visitors, bring world-renowned culture to Scots and help develop local artistic talents. Critics Are Unhappy This year, critics were unhappy at the number of conventional productions, such as Brahms's First Symphony and ''The Barber of Seville,'' although paradoxically the Cologne Opera Company's production received one of the best reviews. But the 1981 festival generated a measure of cultural controversy as well. Perhaps the most discussion was over Bach's St. Matthew's Passion by the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Claudio Abbado, which opened the festival. The performance, including six soloists and a large chorus, ran against modern trends for the piece toward smallness, but twice played to full houses. Other official productions also received mostly mixed reviews. One of the eagerly awaited events is the premiere Tuesday of ''On the Razzle,'' a new play by Tom Stoppard, whose ''Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead'' was discovered among the offerings of the 1966 fringe. Heavily Theater-Oriented This year's festival was the most heavily theater-oriented ever. Before the arrival of John Drummond, who is running his third festival, directors have been principally from musical backgrounds. The first director was Rudolf Bing. However, the theater presentations this year were accorded fair to poor reviews, particularly ''As You Like It'' by the Birmingham Repertory Theater, which one critic called ''a pageant not a play.'' Leonard Bernstein's ''Candide,'' also by the Birmingham company, received only fair notices. Among the most controversial of Mr. Drummond's decisions was the inclusion of three foreign-language plays. The National Theater of Rumania's ''The Girl From Andros,'' a comedy written by Terrence in Greek in 166 B.C., was much criticized, but Jean Racine's ''Britannicus'' played to large and enthusiastic audiences. As for music, the festival featured a variety of well-known groups and performers, such as the London Symphony Orchestra, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the violinist Yehudi Menuhin and the pianist Vladimir Ashkenazy. Perhaps the most praised performance was the premiere by the BBC Symphony Orchestra of John Tavener's ''Akhmatova Requiem,'' a celebration of the Russian poet, described by The Sunday Times as ''affecting and astonishing.'' Mr. Drummond was the narrator. Military Tattoo on Hand In addition to the official and fringe festivals, Edinburgh in late August becomes the setting for a variety of related events, including a military tattoo, performed at night against a backdrop of Edinburgh Castle above the city. Although derided by serious arts lovers, the event is a bigger draw than the official festival, selling a quarter-million tickets. Also under way are several special art exhibitions aimed almost exclusively at local residents, and a film festival, which this year is shorter than usual but which still includes 40 new feature films and a screening of the 1927 production of ''Napoleon,'' a day-long event. In addition to ticket sales, the festival is paid for by $1.5 million in local grants and $300, 000 from corporate sponsors who have been increasingly sought. The festival's organizers contend that the cash benefit of the festival to the city is $7 million to $30 million. Illustrations: Photo of Leo Nucci  ",

After years as the top global direct sales company, Avon slipped out of that spot in 2014. The company 2019s revenue declined 20% last year to $8.85 billion, from a peak of $11.1 billion in 2011, and after a lengthy probe into corruption in its China operations, Avon agreed to pay a $135 million settlement. So, are we looking at the end of the era in which women purchased beauty products from friends and neighbors who sold door-to-door? Not necessarily. There are a number of young, upstart companies that are trying to succeed using the Avon model 2014albeit with modern twists such as selling via social media. 201cThe idea of women sharing something they 2019re passionate about with other women works better than ever before, 201d says Jessica Herrin, founder of Stella & Dot, which just launched Ever Skincare, a new line of direct-sales skin care. 201cSocial selling has the person-to-person feel of the past but leverages social media and mobile technology to make it more flexible and lucrative for women. 201d Here 2019s how three relative newcomers to the direct-sales category are looking to become the next 201ccompany for women. 201d Not just a direct-sales player, Beautycounter calls itself a 201cdirect retail 201d company because its products are available through a network of nearly 8,000 consultants, as well as via its website and strategic partnerships with companies like JCrew and Goop. 201cWe looked at how consumers are shopping and where the world is going, and consumers demand to shop through multiple channels, 201d says Gregg Renfrew, founder and CEO of Beautycounter. Renfrew says that Beautycounter 2019s emphasis on healthy ingredients is unique and allows the company to go after consumers who are dissatisfied with traditional products. Beautycounter has banned almost 1,600 allowed ingredients from its skincare and cosmetics. 201cU.S. companies are allowed to use products that are risky and have been banned in the EU, 201d Renfrew says. 201cBeautycounter is a contemporary concept in an industry that is slow to change. Our omnichannel sales model and product strategy of avoiding questionable ingredients set us apart from more traditional companies such as Avon. 201d After launching in March 2013, Beautycounter has sold more than 1 million product units, say Renfrew, who attributes the growth to an increase in health-conscious consumers. New consultants can get started selling Beautycounter products for as little as $85. As for how much they earn, 201cit depends on how they build their business and what they put into it, 201d Renfrew says. 201cWe have people earning $50 a month and some earning tens of thousands a month. 201d Created with the company 2019s patent-pending LSR10 complex, Ever 2019s products promise results within 30 days and are developed 201cwithout the risk of potentially toxic ingredients, 201d Herrin says. 201cSocial media works for our specialists because they can share their own before and after pics and their friends see them. 201d After launching her first successful business (WeddingChannel.com), Herrin says she regularly fielded questions from other women about how to start a business. But she didn 2019t feel like she had an easy system to share. That 2019s why she launched Ever as a direct-sales company. 201cI wanted to democratize entrepreneurship with a kit that 2019s designed to make it easy for women to start a business, 201d she says. 201cWe do the distribution, product design and development, and marketing, and our specialists really have all they need to start in their kit. 201d Additionally, Herrin sees a chance to capture some of the market once held by traditional direct-sales cosmetics companies. She says the company offers a unique blend of 201chigh tech and high touch, 201d using social media and speedy delivery to keep customers coming back. Ever 2019s starting kits cost as little as $79, and specialists earn 15% to 35% commission on product sales. While the line just launched officially in late May, it grew to more than 1,000 specialists and more than $1 million in sales during its two-month beta phase. 201cWe 2019re really thrilled with the specialists 2019 earnings per hour, 201d Herrin says. 201cThey are earning close to $100 per hour doing skincare socials in person and online. 201d Dr. Katie Rodan and Dr. Kathy Fields, the dermatologists who invented acne treatment Proactiv, launched Rodan & Fields in 2008 in an attempt to do for anti-aging products what Proactiv did for acne-fighters. Last year, the company 2019s sales reached more than $320 million. The company 2019s products are sold directly by its 75,000 consultants, mostly women, located across the country. These sellers get started by purchasing a business kit ranging from $45 to about $1,0, depending on the number of products included. While some consultants join to get discounts on skin care products and just earn a few thousand dollars each year, the company says top sellers 201cearn six figures or more 201d per year.  ",

Speaking Spanish alongside his Cuban counterpart Bruno Rodriguez only hours after diplomatic ties were restored on Monday following a five-decade hiatus , Kerry said Washington welcomes this new beginning in its relationship with the people and government of Cuba. The secretary added this milestone does not signify an end to the many differences that still separate our governments. But it does reflect the reality that the Cold War ended long ago , that the interests of both countries are better served by engagement than by estrangement, he insisted at a packed press conference at the State Department. Those differences were immediately laid bare when Rodriguez swiftly demanded an end to the US economic blockade of the communist-run Caribbean island and the return of territory used as a US military base and jail in southern Guantanamo Bay. Totally lifting the blockade , the return of the illegally occupied territory of Guantanamo, as well as the full respect for Cuban sovereignty and the compensation to our people for human and economic damages, are crucial to be able to move towards the normalisation of relations, Rodriguez said.

But we understand that Cuba has strong feelings about it , Kerry said , as he confirmed he would visit Havana on August 14. He will be the first US secretary of state to visit Cuba since 1945. And on a day of history, Rodriguez was the first Cuban foreign minister to be welcomed to the State Department since 1958. Make no mistake , the process of fully normalising relations between the United States and Cuba will be long and complex, Kerry cautioned , adding the US would not be overflowing with expressions of optimism. Along the way , there are sure to be bumps in the road and moments of frustration. Patience will be required. The Cuban flag was proudly flying over Havana's newly restored embassy in Washington on Monday for the first time in 54 years after the two bitter adversaries agreed in December to normalise ties. The Cuban banner first took its place in the columned marble entrance hall to the State Department , hoisted before dawn between the flags of Croatia and Cyprus. It was then raised at the Cuban embassy in Washington, which until Monday had been operating as an interests section.

Simpson poses with the Heisman Trophy at New York's Downtown Athletic Club in December 1968 09 03 2015 AT 10:00 AM EDT Los Angeles prosecutors have charged a man in connection with the theft of O.J. Simpson's 1968 Heisman Trophy more than 20 years ago. Lewis Eugene Starks Jr.,56, is charged with one felony count of receiving stolen property, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office. Starks plead not guilty Wednesday afternoon. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for September 15. The trophy, along with Simpson's jersey and a plaque, were in a display case at the University of Southern California's Heritage Hall when they vanished on July 28, 1994. Simpson was awaiting trial at the time for the murder of his ex-wife, Nicole, and her friend Ron Goldman. He was later acquitted of murder charges, but was found liable for their deaths in subsequent a civil trial. His personal Heisman Trophy 2013 awarded to college football's most outstanding player 2013 was seized under the $33.5 million judgment, and auctioned in 1999 for $230,000. Prosecutors say Starks, who was arrested on Monday, allegedly tried to sell the Heisman late last year, even though it was widely known to be stolen. It was found in Starks possession, prosecutors say. The Heisman was given to Simpson in 1968 for his prowess as a running back at USC, before he started his Hall of Fame career in the National Football League. Starks is being held on $20,000 bail. If convicted, Starks faces up to six years in prison.  ",

The 9.77-tonne Dolphin went missing off the southwest coast near the island of Chuja on Saturday night and its wreckage was found Sunday morning. The three survivors have been rescued and flown by helicopter to a hospital on Jeju island south of Chuja. It has been determined that 21 people were on board the ill-fated boat , with three having been rescued, 10 found dead and eight missing, Lee Pyung-hyun , chief of the Jeju coast guard, was quoted by Yonhap news agency as saying. More than 50 naval and coastguard vessels, as well as a Lynx helicopter and a P-3C maritime patrol plane, were searching for the missing. One survivor said the boat capsized in an instant before many passengers were swept away by strong waves. I was sleeping when the boat's engine went off and the captain told us to get out and water started to fill the boat , the 38-year-old surnamed Park told Yonhap. Park said he and other survivors climbed on top of a floating piece of the boat and held on for more than 10 hours before being rescued. They praised the courage of the boat captain Kim Cheol-Soo , who was among the dead.

Barnes and Noble claims the top position , with Target and Walmart rounding out the Top 3 companies. The Top 20 Most Powerful Back-to-School Retail Brands are ranked by a unique , quantiative measure called BrandPower as measured through Tenet's CoreBrand Index. The CoreBrand Index, a landmark study conducted continuously since 1990, is based upon an annual U.S. survey of approximately ten thousand consumer opinion elites and business-decision makers. Tapping the CoreBrand Index, the BrandPower score is a weighted composite of two key metrics that contribute to a brand's ability to drive long-term growth: Familiarity and Favorability. Familiarity measures awareness of the brand. Favorability is the perception of the brand (among those who are well aware of it), and is based upon three attributes that tie directly to future business performance: Overall Reputation, Perception of Management, and Investment Potential. Despite the threat of online shopping taking over physical stores, the BrandPower of big-box retailers has been on the rise. Average Familiarity and Favorability has steadily increased year-over-year since 2011. A collective focus on digital and omnichannel innovation have allowed these traditional big box stores to reimagine their customers' path to purchase. By offering new conveniences and incentives to shop both in-store and online, they have been able to remain competitive, while also alluring a key demographic: Millennials. Walmart (#3) has acquired more than a dozen technology companies in the past year, many of which have contributed to major improvements and changes to its e-commerce properties. According to the company's 2015 annual report, e-commerce sales rose faster than the market globally last year at approximately 22 percent. In addition, the company launched an online price-matching service last year. To gear up for back-to-school, the company took online prices to all-time low, and is offering free shipping to student dormitories on all orders over $35. Commenting on the Top 20 Most Powerful Back-to-School Retail Brands , Steve Makadok, Partner of Tenet's CoreBrand Analytics practice, said: While big box retailers demonstrate the biggest gains on BrandPower , the key to their staying power will be continued innovations in digital and the omnichannel brand experience. Brands falling out of favor with consumers and investors are struggling to keep pace with the change in retail. These brands would benefit from a renewed focus in three key areas: customer experience, product and brand innovation, as well as improvements across channels, including digital and mobile. Click here to view the Top 20 Most Powerful Back-to-School Retail Brands of 2015. A company's BrandPower score is determined by a survey of approximately ten thousand influential people on two key brand metrics: Familiarity and Favorability. This carefully screened audience , representing opinion elites business decision-makers at the top 20 percent of American corporations are polled on the following: Familiarity - Respondents are considered to be familiar with a brand if they state that they know more than just the company name. Familiarity scores can range from 0 to 100. Favorability - Respondents familiar with a corporation are then asked about three dimensions that together, form a Favorability score, also on a scale of 0 to 100. BrandPower is calculated as a function of Familiarity and Favorability, enabling easy comparision among competitors, against industry averages and agains world-class brands. The starting point for determining the Top 20 Most Powerful Back-to-School Retail Brands is the CoreBrand Index (CBI) - a quantitative database based on a continuous benchmark tracking survey of nearly 1 ,000 companies across 50 industries. The study has been in the field continuously since 1990. Formed from the merger of Brandlogic and CoreBrand, Tenet Partners is a brand innovation and marketing consultancy that helps companies create brand value and unearth business opportunities by putting customers at the center of their business strategies.

A theatricalized performance of the chamber music ensemble 2019s self-titled release, the show, playing at Oberon through Saturday, is a collection of story-songs full of humor with a dash of horror, told by characters that emerge sharply into focus before fading again into the background. Atmosphere and some stunning vocal and musical talents create an enchanting concert-musical. Members of the Ghost Quartet are positioned in the audience, which sits in a U facing the stage and central playing area. On the stage, Brittain Ashford and Gelsey Bell deliver some breathtaking harmonies as well as spine-tingling interpretations of songs, with Ashford 2019s lush alto brimming with personality and Bell 2019s clear soprano ringing out with emotion and power. Composer-lyricist and text writer Dave Malloy plays the piano, keyboard, ukulele, and percussion, while Brent Arnold sits at the opposite corner of the room on the cello, guitar, dulcimer, and the truly haunting two-stringed erhu. Malloy offers up nearly two dozen songs, helpfully introducing the title and the track number for each one, and while references to ghosts, Edgar Allan Poe, Stephen King, 201cThe Twilight Zone, 201d Neil Gaiman 2019s 201cSandman, 201d and Grimms 2019 Fairy Tales all appear, you will also hear riffs from 201cFrozen 201d and Stephen Sondheim 2019s 201cInto the Woods, 201d among others. Two of the most evocative moments come with Malloy 2019s nod to Thelonius Monk 2019s 201cRuby My Dear 201d and Bell 2019s a cappella performance of 201cThe Wind & Rain, 201d described as a 17th-century English murder ballad. In between the songs are mini-stories that set the tone for the music to come, introduce the array of odd characters who populate the story-songs, or invite us into moments between the characters. Always the tone 2014 among the performers and within the music 2014 is one of unaffected sincerity. An awkward pas de deux between Malloy and Ashford is heartbreaking in its simplicity. Director Annie Tippe keeps the stories flowing with a stylish grace and an ease of movement that is so unpretentious you may find yourself eager to take up a percussion instrument if it 2019s offered, or tilt a glass of whiskey (or cider) poured for everyone as the ensemble sings a tune about four different kinds of the liquor. 201cGhost Quartet, 201d with its tight harmonies, compelling characters, and rich musicianship, draws us into a cozy world to explore our fascination with and connection to otherworldly spirits for a uniquely thrilling evening.

The company and its partner TechnoServe have been working hard to revive high-quality coffee production in South Sudan through the implementation of the Nespresso AAA Sustainable Quality 2122 Program. 201cWe are really proud to partner with Nespresso in South Sudan to work with the communities to start rebuilding the coffee industry there, 201c says Paul Stewart, regional director coffee initiative for TechnoServe. 201cWe are really starting with nothing, so we need to help farmers make the first steps to develop their coffee industry. Over the last year, we have accomplished many firsts in the history of South Sudan. 201d The following are nine firsts achieved by Nespresso and TechnoServe in South Sudan in their efforts to revive high-quality coffee production: First coffee cooperatives registered in South SudanThe project supported the organisation and registration of three coffee cooperatives in the region of Yei, the first of their kind in South Sudan. First coffee wet mills in South SudanCoffee processing businesses, known as wet mills, which transform the cherries picked by farmers into exportable coffee beans, are essential to produce high-quality coffee. During 2013, the project supported each of the cooperatives to construct a mill. First fully washed coffee ever produced in South SudanCooperative leaders were supported to write a business plan, and staff were trained and coached during the harvest season on how to operate the new coffee wet mills. Previously, coffee was only processed with the dry method. First ever phytosanitary certificate for South SudanThe project supported the Ministry of Agriculture to create a template phytosanitary certificate 2013 a document required for the international trade of agricultural produce. The first phytosanitary certificate was issued by the Ministry of Agriculture for the first shipment of coffee, which was exported to Nespresso in July 2013. First coffee ever exported from South SudanA shipment of 1.8 metric tonnes parchment coffee air-freighted to Nespresso in 2013 was the first export of coffee from South Sudan. The first export by land of coffee from South Sudan took place in July 2014 when 10 tonnes of parchment coffee was transported to Uganda, also destined for Nespresso. First ever non-oil export from South Sudan to EuropeAn official in the Ministry of Agriculture reported that the shipment of coffee to Nespresso in 2013 was the first ever non-oil export from South Sudan to Europe. First exporter identified and trainedA local South Sudanese company was identified to provide the service of exporting coffee from South Sudan to Uganda. The company imports packaged food products from Uganda and therefore had the relevant experience for handling coffee and dealing with customs requirements. First coffee export tax revenues to governmentThe county government in Yei collected export tax revenue from the coffee export in 2014, the first time the tax has been collected on coffee. First legal processing and export of foreign coffee through UgandaWhile coffee has long been smuggled from the Democratic Republic of Congo into Uganda for re-export, this was the first legal importation of coffee into Uganda. In the coming years, Nespresso and TechnoServe will continue to support the three coffee cooperatives by providing coaching on coffee quality and business skills, and develop the marketing channels for coffee.

   "input": "I'm fed up with the Jewish conversation just being about Israel or antisemitism, says Raymond Simonson , sitting in a meeting room with floor-to-ceiling windows, overlooking Finchley Road in northwest London. I want to talk about Curb Your Enthusiasm instead , and the paintings of Chagall, the music of Amy Winehouse and Woody Allen films. With thick glasses , substantial sideburns and a brown tweed jacket that give him the look of someone fresh from a Woody Allen film set, Simonson is the chief executive of a new multimillion pound complex that aims to provide a home for all of the above. Hovering like a low-slung liner, its long ribbons of windows separated by crisp bands of white concrete, JW3 (a riff on its home in NW3) declares itself to be a new postcode for Jewish life 2013 with not a Torah or menorah in sight. Set to open at the end of September after 10 years in the making , it is the brainchild of Vivien Duffield, whose Clore Duffield Foundation stumped up 00a340m of the 00a350m project cost. It was inspired by her visit to the vast Jewish Community Centre (JCC) in New York, a multi-storey beacon of Jewish culture in Manhattan that made her wonder why London didn't have the same. If you go to the States , Jewish stuff is loud and proud, says Simonson. But over here it's completely different. Indoors , we might shout at each other around the dinner table, smash glasses at our weddings and do boisterous dancing, but outside you keep your head down. Of course we know why it's like that in Europe 2013 my mum escaped Nazi-occupied France 2013 but we shouldn't still be scared of that shadow. While New York's look-at-me JCC seems like a slick private club , complete with a flashy sixth-floor swimming pool, London's version speaks more softly. Set back from the roaring six-lane traffic on Finchley Road on a sloping site, accessed from a bridge that crosses a large sunken courtyard, its four storeys only read as two from street level. Designed by Lifschutz Davidson Sandilands, purveyors of inoffensive modernism-lite, it is dressed in understated beige, brick and reconstituted stone. It is trying to be the Savile Row to the loud Wall Street pinstripe 2013 but it comes off looking a bit M&S. We knew we couldn't just plonk the JCC down here , says Nick Viner , JW3's outgoing CEO who has steered the project since the beginning. He cites Hugh Casson's Ismaili Centre in South Kensington and Denys Lasdun's Royal College of Physicians by Regent's Park as projects he was keen to emulate. Both contain a series of auditoriums and rooms arranged around large public levels and atriums. Both are also wrapped in fortified shells, standing like cultural castles ready to defend against an oncoming siege. By contrast, Viner wanted JW3 to have an open civic quality , not look like an exclusive club, though this is not particularly evident from the street. The bridge , accessed through a big metal gate, reinforces the sense of a secure site, while a giant glass fence marches along the pavement, allowing passers-by to look down on activities in the sunken piazza 2013 an us-and-them relationship with unfortunate connotations of a zoo enclosure. The whole thing is towered over by a nine-storey block of swish apartments, a necessary planning condition, replacing the same number of homes that were on the site before. The fact that the building looks like an embassy should not come as a surprise: it is intended as something of a Jewish cultural ambassador. Within its relatively small footprint, it somehow contains a 270-seat auditorium, a 60-seat cinema, a restaurant and bar, a demonstration kitchen, dance studios, classrooms and medical clinics. This leisure sandwich is even topped off by a penthouse nursery with a ziggurat of ball pools and sandpits on its own roof terrace. It is the kind of ambitious hybrid offspring that might be produced if an academy school had a lovechild with the Barbican. We would like to be mentioned in the same sentence as the Barbican , confirms Viner , along with the Southbank Centre , or the Roundhouse or Rich Mix. With the Camden Arts Centre across the road , he hopes JW3 will lead to an emerging arts hub in this corner of Hampstead. The bar is set high , and with 1,300 events scheduled for the opening three months, the programming team has a lot to live up to. Simonson points out that this only equates to two events per day in each space 2013 we wanted to start light 2013 but the calendar is already brimming with celebrity appearances , from evenings with Kevin Spacey and Nicholas Hytner to Ruby Wax and Zo 00eb Wanamaker. The courtyard will become a mini-farm in the opening weeks and an ice rink over the winter, while upstairs in the classrooms there are courses on Hebrew lettering and henna body-painting, kosher cooking classes and lessons in Krav Maga 2013 the lethal martial art taught to the Israeli Defence Force. But not everything is on-theme: If you come for watercolour classes , it's not Jewish watercolours, says Simonson. We won't make you sit there and paint gefilte fish. Being in Hampstead , the centre has a guaranteed catchment and builds on a strong history of cultural life in the area. It is just down the road from the home of Habonim, AKA the Socialist Zionist Culturally Jewish youth movement , a group where Mike Leigh , Sacha Baron Cohen and David Baddiel started out telling jokes. In their honour, JW3 will host a Jewish comedy club called HavaNaGiggle, plus a comedy class for pensioners 2013 standup for the sit-down age group as Simonson has christened it. JW3 is at pains to point out that it is not a religious centre. It may have the largest Shabbat-compliant lift outside Israel 2013 programmed to function automatically on a Saturday , stopping at every floor 2013 but there is nothing expressly Jewish about the building. I hope people that might never think of going to a synagogue will come here , says Simonson , adding that the programme should appeal to the new kind of three-days-a-year Jew. That used to mean going to the synagogue on our three holiest days , he says , but now there is a generation that might go to the Jewish Film festival , Jewish Book Week and Limmud, a sort of Jewish Edinburgh festival. The idea of JW3 is to have this festival 52 weeks a year, open to everyone. With an energetic director at the helm , and a long list of wealthy benefactors, the centre has every hope of adding another dimension to London's vibrant cultural life 2013 just as long as it can lure people past the fences and across the bridge.

It's not a big [financial] loss for us , but I do believe blocking this technology is a big loss for consumers, and beyond that I only salute Chet Kanojia and his band of Aereo'lers for fighting the good fight, he said. The court said the service constitutes a public performance of copyrighted content.

Aereo had argued that cloud services use the Internet in the same way as it does to store and transfer copyrighted content. It seems like there's a little bit of opening up [in the ruling] of what could happen to new technologies , but this is going to need a much more detailed read to find out those implications, Rich Greenfield , media and technology analyst at BTIG, told CNBC. I think the immediate implication for Aereo is , is there going to be a way for them to get compulsory licenses to survive, or do they simply disappear? The case came before the court when Walt Disney's ABC network , CBS, Comcast's NBCUniversal and Twenty-First Century Fox appealed a decision by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in April 2013 that denied their request to shut Aereo down while litigation moved forward. Aereo, backed by Diller's IAC InterActiveCorp, charged users a low monthly fee to watch live or recorded broadcast TV channels on computers or mobile devices. Aereo did not pay the broadcasters.

This is not an economists' budget but a political budget 2026and all the major provisions are aimed at the coalition's base. For more than a decade , Australia's economy has been fuelled by a mining boom 2013 but a collapse in commodity prices is slowing economic growth and reducing tax receipts. However, after last year's disastrously tightfisted budget sent the conservative government's approval ratings sinking to record lows, the ruling party has chosen this year to play for votes. The highlight of this year's spending plans turned out to be spending for its two core constituencies, mainly tax breaks for small businesses and increased childcare subsidies. Fiscal policy is , in all honesty, aimed at the individual and the nuclear family, and clearly the government have delivered overnight. A cynical call would be to say, votes don't come cheap, said IG market strategist Evan Lucas in a Wednesday note. The government is so haunted by last year's debacle that it neglected to come up with any measures to help Australia wean itself off its dependence on commodity exports , critics said.

While a company spokeswoman says nearly 90 percent of Almay products, including makeup remover, are American made, other products are made in China, the Czech Republic, Germany and Canada. Truth In Advertising.org has complained to the Federal Trade Commission and New York Attorney General's Office about what it says are Almay's false claims. To be fair, the Revlon-owned Almay brand does not appear to have violated labeling requirements, and it is diligent about labeling the origins of its products.

   "input": "* OPEC says worried about prices, ready to talk to producers * EIA data shows U.S. crude oil production contracting NEW YORK, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Oil futures soared on Monday for a third consecutive day, rising more than 8 percent, as a downward revision of U.S. crude production data and OPEC's readiness to talk with other producers helped extend the biggest price surge in 25 years. U.S. crude oil prices have skyrocketed more than $10 a barrel in three days, erasing the month's declines as a series of relatively small-scale supply disruptions and output risks prompted bearish traders to take profits on short positions, which had been at near record highs a week ago. On Monday, prices fell initially but reversed course mid-morning to accelerate into the close, extending gains to more than the 20 percent mark that often signals a bull market. Even so, few were prepared to call a definitive end to the slump. Sharp gains over the past three trading sessions were driven by a combination of short covering and chart-readers again looking to call a bottom falsely , Citi said in a report , saying that prices may yet test new lows before year's end. Brent October futures rose $4.10, or 8.2 percent, to settle at $54.15 a barrel, with volumes relatively muted by a British public holiday. U.S. crude gained $3.98, or 8.8 percent, to settle at $49.20 a barrel, taking three-day gains to 27.5 percent, the most over three days since August 1990. In dollar terms, it is the biggest three-day gain since February 2011. While some analysts have been warning of a rebound in prices after a one-third slump since late June, most have been shocked by the whiplash of the past few days, and wondered whether it was an overreaction to relatively mild triggers. On Monday, some cited a commentary in the latest OPEC Bulletin publication suggesting the group may be increasingly willing to talk to other producers about curbing output as a factor, even though it was broadly in line with previous comments. There has been no indication this summer that core Gulf OPEC members are pushing for more talks. As the organization has stressed on numerous occasions , it stands ready to talk to all other producers. But this has to be on a level playing field. OPEC will protect its own interests, according to the report. The rally was also fueled by revised U.S. government figures showing that domestic production in the first half of the year was lower than initially reported. Even so , the data was in line with the overarching narrative of an industry in decline. The Energy Information Administration said its new survey-based output data showed the United States pumped a hair below 9.3 million barrels per day in June, down by 100,000 bpd from a revised May figure. June figure was also nearly 250, 000 bpd below what the EIA had estimated a few weeks ago.

   "input": "PHOENIX -- The Diamondbacks did not make the biggest splash at the winter meetings last week. Chicago's teams did that, both the south- and north-siders. New Los Angeles Dodgers' president Andrew Friedman found creative ways to rework his unwieldy roster, also. But the D-backs were plenty busy in their own way -- sticking to the plan laid out by chief of baseball operations Tony La Russa and general manager Dave Stewart. The D-backs made three major moves in three days in an attempt to distance themselves from an everything-that-could-go-wrong-did 2014 season. The winter plan was to add a bat, shed salary and get younger and deeper, and the D-backs made inroads on all of that by announcing the signing of Cuban free agent Yasmany Tomas, trading catcher Miguel Montero to the Cubs and adding four controllable pitching prospects in trades that cost them Montero, Didi Gregorius and Wade Miley. Still on the radar are a catcher to pair with Tuffy Gosewisch and possibly a left-handed bat in the outfield. Stewart added to the intrigue Friday when he said that the D-backs have discussed free agent right-handers Max Scherzer and James Shields, the two highest profile pitchers remaining in free agent pool since Jon Lester signed a six-year, $155 million deal with the Cubs. The D-backs entered the offseason saying high-end starters were off limits, and adding Scherzer or Shields would seem to require them to trade another higher-priced veteran such as Aaron Hill in order to get the payroll relief necessary. Shields is believed to be seeking a deal worth perhaps $20 million a year; Scherzer, much higher. The D-backs have shown nimbleness by signing Tomas and making four other offseason deals, including one for starter Jeremy Hellickson, so while adding a big-money starter is unlikely, it seems anything is possible. If the D-backs could swing either Scherzer or Shields to put at the top of the rotation, it would seem to signal they have fast-tracked their rebuilding timetable and hope to contend sooner rather than later in the NL West against the likes of the deep-pocket Dodgers and Giants, who have won three of the last five World Series. The Giants are among the teams rumored to have interest in Shields. If the offseason has shown us one thing, it is that uber competitors La Russa and Stewart are not afraid to make a move and accept some risk. It is difficult to go from 98 losses to 98 wins , but I don't think you give in on the potential that sooner rather than later we can be contenders, La Russa said at the winter meetings , giving a general overview of the team's thinking. If you have a good talent pool and they play tough and they play well , you win extra games. We have a nice young nucleus. There is a lot to build on. We have some quality veterans. I think what the winter is for is to create as much depth as possible. The position player group seem set except for catcher , when the D-backs could target former Cubs starter Welington Castillo or free agents such as David Ross or former University of Arizona catcher Nick Hundley. Ross is rumored to be heavily considering the Cubs because of his association with Lester from their days in Boston. If Tomas sticks at third base, the D-backs could start either Ender Inciarte or David Peralta in the outfield along with A.J. Pollock and Mark Trumbo. First baseman Paul Goldschmidt, Tomas and Trumbo would hit in the middle of the order. Chris Owings should start at one of the middle-infield positions, paired with veteran second baseman Hill or shortstop prospect Nick Ahmed, who is considered a major league-ready defender. With Miley gone and Patrick Corbin not expected to return until perhaps June, the D-backs will not have a left-hander among the front four in a rotation that includes Josh Collmenter and newcomers Rubby De La Rosa, Hellickson and Allen Webster. Lefties Vidal Nuno, Robbie Ray and Andrew Chafin and righties Chase Anderson, Trevor Cahill, Daniel Hudson and Randall Delgado are in the mix for spots in the rotation. If nothing else, there will be no shortage of competition in March. De La Rosa and Webster were acquired from Boston in the Miley trade and Ray was added from Detroit in the three-team trade that sent Gregorius to the New York Yankees. With that group and 20-year old Jeferson Mejia, acquired from the Cubs in the Montero deal, the D-backs have a stable of young, highly projectable arms. De La Rosa is under team control for four years, and the others are under control for the full six years. That nucleus does not include top minor league prospects Archie Bradley, Aaron Blair and Braden Shipley, who are likely to comprise three-fifths of the starting rotation at Class AA Mobile next year. It's not just adding starting pitching that can give us wins in 2015 , but it's building up a group of guys that would be available to pitch that we would control for years beyond 2015, La Russa said.

Thirty miles away, in Boston 2019s Mattapan Square, such signs are hard to find. Some storefronts are vacant, including the McDonald 2019s that closed over the summer. 201cThat was a shock for us, 201d said Patti Powell, a hairstylist who said she has lived in Mattapan all her life. 201cThey were here one day and then, poof, gone just like that. 201d Massachusetts 2019 booming economy is generating the strongest job growth since the late 1990s, but as these starkly different commercial areas show, jobs are not expanding fast enough where they 2019re needed most. Economists said this mismatch between jobs and job seekers remains one of the most vexing challenges for policy makers hoping to spread the benefits of the recovery and prevent the division between rich and poor from hardening. In Mattapan and Acton, the gulf is both longstanding and getting wider. In 2000, for example, the median income in Acton was almost $53,000 higher than in Mattapan; in 2013, the gap increased to $64,580, according to the most recent local data from the US Census Bureau. Poverty in Acton during this period fell by half, to less than 1 percent of families from about 1.7 percent. The share of families living in poverty in Mattapan rose to 16 percent from 14.5 percent. In Acton, a well-to-do bedroom community, the median household income is $110,000 2014 more than 60 percent above the state median of about $67,000. Store managers say they struggle to fill job openings. In urban Mattapan Square, only 20 minutes from downtown Boston, jobs are more scarce. One in eight workers in the neighborhood are unemployed, according to the census data, and the $45,000-a-year median household income is one-third below the state median. While some business owners insist there jobs to be had in the square, few say they are actually hiring. 201cThe nature of the rebound is so uneven, 201d said University of Massachusetts Amherst economics professor Robert N. Pollin. 201cThere is employment, and it follows where the market is. And it 2019s not in working-class communities. It 2019s starkly concentrated at the top. 201d Bridging the gap between places like Mattapan and Acton has been the subject of research and analysis for decades, said Kevin Lang, a professor of labor economics at Boston University. The government has had limited success with efforts to boost business development and employment in struggling commercial districts by creating 201cempowerment zones 201d and offering subsidies. And without a car, it 2019s almost impossible for someone in Mattapan looking for work to get to a place like Acton, he said. There is no bus service in Acton, a town of 22,0, and the commuter rail is miles from commercial shopping and can cost more than $10 each way. 201cThat 2019s hard to fix, 201d said Lang. 201cYou 2019re in a vicious circle. No money to afford a car, and without a car you can 2019t get a job. 201d The pathway to a job at a place like Roche Bros. at the Route 111 shopping plaza begins with a part-time job and can often result in a full-time job with benefits, said Jim Lundy, the supermarket 2019s general manager. Right now, staffing is one of the store 2019s biggest challenges. 201cIt 2019s tough, 201d Lundy said. 201cAnd we 2019re very competitive with wages. 201d A daytime cashier can make $9.75 an hour, more than the state 2019s $9 minimum wage. A meat counter worker can make $10 or more an hour, and drivers for its new delivery service earn $12 and up. Sandra Clark (left) and her mother, Josette Guerrier own Paradise Hair Salon in Mattapan, where the economic recovery is still weak. One of the most popular Mattapan spots for decades has been Brothers, a counter service restaurant that serves hearty portions of smoked pork chops, meat loaf and red velvet cake, and has a wall filled with autographed photos of celebrities, from the Supremes 2019 Mary Wilson to 1980s rappers Run-DMC. Chris Natale, whose family has run the chain for three generations, said it 2019s easy to find a job in Mattapan Square. But, he added, he 2019s not hiring. Some longtime shop owners also said it 2019s increasingly difficult to just stay in business, let alone add more employees. Bea Jung, who owns the clothing store J City with her husband, said rent is going up more than $1,500 a month, forcing them to close the business after 30 years. They will lay off one full-time and one part -time worker when they shut down after the holidays. A giant sign hanging at the storefront says 201cEverything Must Go 201d and 201cGod Bless You. 201d Piled on tables inside the shop are Puma sneakers marked down to $10 from $30, Dickies jumpsuits for $29.99, and T-shirts for $3.99. The couple had hoped to remain in business another decade before retiring, but working 12 hours a day became too much. 201cIt 2019s not busy like it used to be, 201d Jung said. 201cThe economy 2019s not so good and we work too hard and make no money. 201d In Acton, a 14,000-square-foot CVS recently opened across the street from the Acton Plaza Shopping Center, built from the ground up and offering an astounding selection of hair products, as well as an increasing amount of food. If anything, foot and car traffic has increased, which has been good for the nearby Not Your Average Joe 2019s restaurant. Bea Jung, who owns the clothing store J City in Mattapan with her husband, said rent is going up more than $1,500 a month, forcing them to close the business after 30 years. Adam Rutstein, the general manager, said sales are up and he 2019s hiring for every restaurant position except host. Filling those jobs is difficult in a town where unemployment was 3.3 percent last month, lower than the state average of 4.6 percent. 201cOur talent pool is not Acton, it 2019s people who need hourly jobs, 201d he said, 201cso we have to pull from 20 minutes away. 201d Most economists said it 2019s difficult to justify driving any further than that for a lower-paying retail or service jobs.

On Wednesday, FCC chairman Tom Wheeler unveiled a proposal that would require cable and satellite companies to open up their systems, so that consumer electronics firms could build compatible boxes and sell them directly to consumers. Currently, the overwhelming majority of cable subscribers rent their set-top boxes from the cable companies. The FCC estimates the average household pays $231 a year in rental fees, up 185 percent over the past 22 years. Under Wheeler 2019s plan, which will be put to a vote of the five-person commission on Feb. 18, a consumer could purchase a box that could be used with any cable service. The one-time purchase could save consumers hundreds of dollars. It might also hasten the deployment of new features that complement the changing tastes of TV viewers. The FCC is working to make it easier to buy cable boxes from firms other than your cable provider. For instance, few of today 2019s set-top boxes integrate standard TV networks with Internet video streaming services. 201cConsumers today would like to mix live television like CBS and NBC with Netflix and Hulu, 201d said Ken Plotkin, president of Hauppauge Inc. in Hauppauge, NY., a company that makes cable TV hardware for personal computers. But to watch Internet video, the viewer must usually shift from the cable box to a separate set-top box or to software stored on the TV. Under the FCC plan, a maker of Internet streaming boxes like Apple Inc. or Amazon.com could combine cable TV and online video, for a seamless viewing experience. Such a service could be a major boon for video producers that target niche audiences, ranging from racial and ethnic minorities to religious groups. 201cThat kind of stuff tends not to make it to popular ratings-based channels, 201d said Matthew Zinn, general counsel of the set-top box maker Tivo Inc. in San Jose, Calif. Instead, it 2019s mostly streamed over the Internet, where many potential viewers might never see it. Set-top boxes that combine streaming with standard TV could make these shows available to millions more viewers.

However, if the FCC opens up the set-top box market, manufacturers could offer boxes with advanced user interfaces and personalization features that could detect a user 2019s tastes and interests and suggest other programs he or she might like, whether from the Internet or cable. Cable companies aren 2019t happy about the FCC plan. 201cThe proposal, like prior federal government technology mandates, would impose costs on consumers, adversely impact the creation of high-quality content, and chill innovation, 201d said a blog posting by Comcast Corp. senior vice president Mark Hess. And cable industry analyst Brett Sappington, of Parks Associates in Dallas, said that companies like Tivo already offer third-party cable set-top boxes, but few consumers purchase them. 201cMany don 2019t even consider the option of buying a set-top box somewhere else, 201d Sappington said. But Parks Associates estimates a third of US homes with broadband Internet access have purchased Internet video-streaming devices, so a box that could deliver both Internet video and cable TV might find an audience.

The ballroom dancer from Seattle, Washington, vowed that she would dance again and, in the same breath, that she would one day complete the Boston Marathon. Now, despite joking that she was all hyped up on Vicodin at the time these plans were set , the 35-year-old is making good on the second part of her pledge. Haslet-Davis is training to run the 26.2-mile race this April. I have come to tears every time I've really , really thought about what's it going to be like to go down and take that right onto Boylston street 2013 I will be crying, Haslet Davis tells PEOPLE. I hope I have enough air to cry and run at the same time. Adrianne Haslet-Davis runs the final blocks of the 2014 Boston Marathon with her brothers Haslet-Davis and her team will be running the marathon on April 18 to raise money for , an organization that provides prosthetic limbs to those who can't afford them. I want people to see what I'm doing and know they can do it , too, she says. I'm running this race as a personal triumph , but really, I'm running to prove to amputees that they shouldn 00e2 0080 0099t limit themselves just because of a prosthetic. The professional ballroom dancer and event speaker says that every day since she lost part of her left leg in 2013 , she has tried to just give it a try. A lot of people said , 'God, you're not a runner, how are you going to do this?' And I thought there was a time in my life when I wasn 00e2 0080 0099t a ballroom dancer either, but I had that dream and I made it come true, she says. I feel like we can put these limitations on ourselves or we can say , 'Why don 00e2 0080 0099t I just give it a try?' and that's been my motto since the marathon. Adrianne Haslet-Davis dances at the 2015 Boston Marathon finish line In 2014 , Haslet-Davis ran the last few blocks of the marathon with her brothers, and in 2015, she with her dancer partner. Both moments represented significant milestones, but this year, she says, is going to mean everything.  ",

That was what drew me here, to come and study and to experience jazz music in the country that it was created in. 201d Think of: 201cYou could think of me as jazz music meets contemporary. I have a great respect for the jazz music idiom, but choose to combine it with contemporary influences to experiment with the possibilities as a singer and as a modern jazz composer in today 2019s world. 201d What caught our eye: On Feb. 4, Dietz was the only Boston-area musician to take home a 2016 Herb Alpert Young Jazz Composer Award, presented by the ASCAP Foundation. Light-bulb moment: 201cMy love for the artform, it continues to grow throughout my life, but probably my light-bulb moment would be seeing great live music, such as seeing Wayne Shorter at Sydney Opera House in 2012. That was definitely a light-bulb moment and inspired me to continue on this journey, which is so unpredictable. 201d Biggest thrill: Dietz can 2019t pinpoint just one, but acknowledges that winning the ASCAP award, recording an EP, performing in New York City alongside local musicians, and getting out to see her favorite artists live are all thrills for her. Inspired by: 201cI may be listening to modern jazz music such as Eric Harland, Donny McCaslin, or Jason Moran one minute, and R&B or hip-hop the next, 201d Dietz said of her influences. 201cI enjoy classical music and I often go to Boston 2019s wonderful BSO concerts. Also, as I get older, I 2019m going back and listening to more traditional jazz recordings to make sure I 2019m always learning the history of the music, because I think that 2019s really important as a jazz musician. 201d Aspires to: 201cI aspire to keep creating music and to experiment with the possibilities of what a jazz singer is capable of in today 2019s music world. My main goal is to create music that has no ego and comes from the heart. 201d For good luck: I try to be as prepared as possible for shows. There 2019s no such thing as really winging it when it comes to giving a great performance and you 2019re the band leader. But otherwise, I have a routine of drinking mint tea to relax before you start a performance. What people should know: Dietz 2019s self-titled debut EP is available on CD Baby and iTunes. Coming soon: Dietz will both finish her master 2019s program and release a full-length EP later this year. 201cMy next step is to get this record out and to perform around Boston and New York. In terms of where I 2019ll be, I 2019ll either be in Boston or New York, 201d Dietz said. 201cIt 2019s not confirmed yet, but I love Boston though, so I 2019ve just got to decide. 201d  ",

Great plan? Kelly hails approach that 2019s left 49ers roster unchanged What the heck are the 49ers doing in free agency? Chip Kelly 2019s answer: They 2019re declining to hand out superstar contracts to players who have yet to achieve stardom. Kelly said the front office had a 201cgreat plan 201d entering free agency, which began last week with the usual wave of lucrative deals. Despite having the NFL 2019s fourth-most salary-cap space ($53.7 million), the 49ers only signed journeyman quarterback Thad Lewis in the first week. 201cAre we going to take this player and pay him more than anybody on our team? 201d Kelly said. 201cAnd is that player worth more than anybody on our current team? You also have to kind of look at that. 201cSome of the money that was thrown around at the beginning, you got to be able to manage that. You 2019re going to pay some guy who 2019s never been to a Pro Bowl that 2019s going to make more than anybody on your roster. That 2019s a little bit difficult. There are a lot of things that get involved in some of these things. 201d Much of the mega-cash that was thrown around was given to players such as guard Kelechi Osemele (Raiders), cornerback Janoris Jenkins (Giants) and defensive ends Olivier Vernon (Giants) and Malik Jackson (Jaguars). That quartet signed contracts that included $158.7 million in guaranteed money despite never reaching a Pro Bowl. Still, the 49ers 2019 conservative free agency approach has, at this point, left them with an unchanged roster. And that roster is coming off a 5-11 season in which the 49ers scored the fewest points in the NFL and had the second-worst point differential. During the first eight days of free agency, the 49ers 2019 roster tweaks essentially consist of trading guard Alex Boone for former Jaguars guard Zane Beadles. Kelly said the 49ers are still scanning the free-agent shelves, although he didn 2019t mention it 2019s hard to locate many potential impact players on the market. 201cI think you just have to look at who fits and who 2019s the right fit for the organization, 201d Kelly said. 201cI don 2019t know if it 2019s let big money deals go or not go. It 2019s just what exactly are you looking for. Our guys do a great job of targeting what we want the San Francisco 49ers to be, and see how it works out from a contract standpoint. 201d The 49ers haven 2019t found many fits so far and it increasingly appears they 2019ll rely on the draft to upgrade the roster. They do have 12 picks, but they have just three of the first 104 selections. So what the heck are they doing? It 2019s still a question worth asking.  ",

He spoke to Marc Myers. Black teens in my neighborhood in the 1950s didn 2019t have much opportunity or hope. I grew up in segregated Baltimore, and in junior high school, the coolest thing you could be was uninformed. If you knew something, you were an outlier. I was the ninth of 11 siblings 2014six boys and five girls. My family lived in a Federalist-style row house on Division Street, a block from Pennsylvania Avenue, the cultural spine of the black community then. Nearby was the Royal Theatre, where I saw every major performer who came through town. Throughout my youth, I sat in that dark theater listening to live music and watching feature movies while fantasizing about what I would do when I grew up. In 1954, when I was 8, I had an epiphany while watching 201cCabin in the Sky. 201d The 1943 movie starred every major black performer at the time, but the actor who jumped off the screen was John 201cBubbles 201d Sublett. He played Domino Johnson, the film 2019s Lothario. In the movie, 201cBubbles 201d sings 201cShine 201d backed by Duke Ellington 2019s orchestra. When he dances up a flight of stairs at the end, a voice inside me said, 201cAndr 00e9, that 2019s what you 2019re going to do. 201d But I had a ways to go. My father, John, was a tailor, and we were just hovering above impoverishment. Our two-story row house was tight, and my bothers and sisters practically slept on top of each other. I slept with my father in one bed for many years and then with one of my brothers. We didn 2019t have family dinners. My mother, Mary, cooked pot meals, and when you were hungry you 2019d dip in and eat. We never spoke while eating. You used that time to do something else. I read and did my homework. To help make ends meet, my mother did domestic work for white families who lived beyond the area 2019s racial demarcation. Then she 2019d come home and take care of us. That helped tear at the family relationship. Once I asked my mother why she had so many children. She described us as her wealth and happiness. My father loved us, too, but I sensed he viewed the situation differently. It was an overwhelming challenge for him to provide for us. He always seemed worried, like a man struggling to keep his head above water. Becoming an entertainer appealed to me because of my parents 2019 deferred dreams. My mother had confided in me that she wanted to be a chorus girl when she was young but that her strict parents wouldn 2019t let her. My father said he had wanted to be a singer, but his parents warned him against making singing a career if he expected to support a family. My father sang in a choir, and the few conversations I recall having with him were of the 201cI could have been a contender 201d variety. In my neighborhood, most of the stores that anchored the black community were Jewish-owned 2014the cleaners, grocery, clothing store and liquor store. I saw in those families a kind of serenity, intelligence and collaboration that didn 2019t exist in my chaotic neighborhood. As a young boy, I was convinced my family was caught in this web while the Jewish families had figured out a way to escape and move up. Clearly the secret was education. At that time, most people my age weren 2019t going to school. They were truant or slept during classes. In junior high school, I made a conscious decision to go to Baltimore City College, an elite public high school that prepared you for higher education. To get in, I had to pass an entrance exam and study a classical language. Fortunately I had studied Latin. After I was accepted, people in my neighborhood thought I was 201ccute 201d for trying to leave. I had to take two buses, and the experience was lonely and dangerous. College became possible because I was viewed as a deserving student by a Quaker-run scholarship fund. I won a scholarship but had to attend a Quaker college of the board 2019s choosing. I attended Wilmington College in Wilmington, Ohio, which had only 35 black students, 25 of whom were African. When I was a sophomore in the early 1960s, a teacher in the theater department approached me after I joined the drama club. He wanted to produce 201cRaisin in the Sun 201d and cast me as Walter Younger. When I performed in 201cRaisin 201d at Wilmington, my mother and my sister Mary took a bus to see me. It 2019s one thing to have a teacher say you did a great job but quite another when your family witnesses the authenticity of your dream. After, my mother said, 201cAndr 00e9, child, that was beautiful. 201d From then on I was determined to be a performer. Some years later, in 1975, I landed the title role in 201cThe Wiz 201d on Broadway. In 1978, when I was performing in 201cAin 2019t Misbehavin 2019, 201d I cold-called Bubbles in Los Angeles. He was in his 80s by then and had suffered several strokes. I brought him to New York to see me in a nightclub tribute to him. That night I sang 201cShine 201d and told the audience how Bubbles had influenced me. Then I introduced him. He jiggled a little in his wheelchair and started to cry.  ",

   "input": "On the morning of Oct. 25, my flight from Chicago's O'Hare Airport was delayed as usual, so I searched for Bills Jaguars on Twitter , which immediately took me to the Yahoo Sports account. It had a direct link to the stream of the NFL game in London. I clicked, and within three seconds, I was watching the action from Wembley Stadium. Afterward, I asked people what they thought. Responses were split along generational lines. Among older fans, I heard feedback like: I could never watch meaningful games on my phone and I couldn't figure out how to watch. Younger fans were more interested: I pulled it up for a few minutes. It was pretty cool , said one person , or, Checked in on LeSean McCoy because he's on my fantasy team. Despite mixed reviews , Yahoo's streaming of the Bills-Jaguars game, which cost it $20 million, still must be considered a success because of its ground-breaking significance. The NFL announced Tuesday that 10 of its 16 Thursday Night Football broadcasts this season will be streamed for free on Twitter. (Verizon gets to stream the other six through its NFL Mobile app.) For Twitter, this is a big win. The company is under intense pressure from its shareholders to increase its revenue. A mere $10 million for direct streams of CBS and NBC broadcasts on Thursdays is a start. According to news reports, the national commercials from the NBC and CBS feeds will be shown on Twitter's stream. But Twitter will be allowed to sell the spots reserved for local TV commercials, about 15 per game. It is also a win for the NFL, which expands its massive distribution to another platform. As Roger Goodell said in a statement, Twitter is where live events unfold. He also noted Twitter's significant role in the fan experience: There is a massive amount of NFL-related conversation happening on Twitter during our games. Twitter's hosting of this conversation appears to have been the difference in winning the Thursday streaming rights. Other companies -- including Yahoo , Google, Amazon, Facebook, Verizon and CBS -- were in the mix, and at least one bid was reportedly $5 million higher than Twitter's bid. But with Twitter, fan discussion, analysis and the actual game will be right there on one screen. This fall Thursday Night Football will be streamed live @twitter so fans will see more of this. https: t.co s6tbr9FjvY 2014 Roger Goodell (@nflcommish) April 5, 2016 Virtually every active Twitter user who is interested in football will engage to some degree. Perhaps not every second of every game, but gone are the days of having to be in a home or a bar to watch a game. Out to dinner, stuck in the office or on a date, there is now no way to stop fans from checking in on live video of the game. This is about transforming the fan experience with football , says Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. People watch NFL games with Twitter today. Now they'll be able to watch right on Twitter Thursday nights. By becoming the digital hub of Thursday Night Football , Twitter will be a showcase for how quickly the streaming of NFL games has progressed. CBS live-streamed a few Thursday Night games in 2014, then did seven in 2015. Now the NFL has sold Thursday streaming for the upcoming season for $10 million. It also shows that the league understands the importance of developing new ways to serve its product, whether that's to cord-cutters or those who grew up with a digital-first mindset. The NFL-Twitter deal reflects the viewing sensibilities for fans my age (22). Consider ... -- I watched most Monday Night Football games last year on ESPN3. -- NBC Sports Extra is my home for the Stanley Cup Playoffs. -- I caught a lot of Northwestern basketball at the gym on BTN2Go. The expectation is that sports should be available for us to watch when and where we want to. The reasoning is simple: Technology has made it possible. So in addition to Twitter and the NFL being winners in this deal, so are younger fans whose lifestyle is digitally driven. Which brings us to some potential losers: CBS, Fox, NBC and ESPN all have big-money TV deals that last through at least 2021. But the NFL's one-year contract with Twitter is just the start of the streaming blitz. Although all of these established networks have dabbled in streaming live games, this has revolved mostly around TV subscriptions, in-market content or games available on national broadcasts. At some point, they will need to get themselves deeper into the streaming game to retain their audiences and or attract new ones. It is interesting to note that CBS, which launched its Over The Top product late last year, was listed among Twitter's competitors for the Thursday streaming package. CBS' decision to go OTT shows an understanding that it needs a fresh approach to pick up viewers. Many young professionals are not even buying cable anymore, opting for Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, Netflix and Hulu. And unlike those services, which require a certain level of subscription, Twitter is free. Forget cable. All you need is 90 seconds to sign up. Even if it isn't free, streaming is still attractive. A pioneering study on the behavior of sports fans by the Center for the Digital Future at USC Annenberg and The PostGame revealed that fans say they will pay more for streaming than for similar channels via cable or satellite television. The ability to watch out-of-market NFL games is already expanding. NFL Sunday Ticket was once only available on DirecTV. Last season , a streaming version of Sunday Ticket was introduced. There were stipulations, and it still involved a subscription, but this was part of the same trend that included Yahoo's Lions-Jaguars game, Verizon's NFL Mobile app and the new Twitter deal. This puts some heat on the TV networks -- which have always had the leverage to subjugate NFL fans to specific games broadcast into their homes -- to figure out some sort of streaming play. They've got a lot of work to do. And a lot of coding to learn. -- Follow Jeffrey Eisenband on Twitter @JeffEisenband.

   "input": "SAN FRANCISCO 2014 As Volkswagen faced a court-mandated deadline to reach an agreement with regulators on a plan to fix its polluting diesel cars last month, one lawyer for the German automaker mentioned that he had probably never worked harder in his career. 201cI 2019m optimistic that you 2019ll be able to break your record in the next month, 201d Charles R. Breyer, the federal judge presiding over the hearing in San Francisco, replied. 201cThat 2019s my goal. 201d Breyer, who is overseeing the class-action lawsuits brought by American car owners, then gave Volkswagen until April 21 to present a proposal as the first step in the litigation. The company admitted in September to installing software on diesel vehicles to cheat on emissions tests, but hundreds of thousands of its cars remain on American roads, spewing excess pollution. If Volkswagen does not present a plan that is approved by regulators by Thursday, it could conceivably face a trial before Breyer this summer. 201cHe 2019s put the hammer down, and he 2019s said, 2018I want to know what Volkswagen 2019s answer is, 2019 201d said Erik Gordon, a professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan who studies federal multidistrict litigation. The judge, he added, is 201cnot in the mood for stalling, that 2019s for sure. 201d Widely described by lawyers in California as fair, pragmatic, and creative, the judge, the younger brother of Justice Stephen G. Breyer, holds sway over whether and how Volkswagen fixes the cars and how vehicle owners will be compensated. Charles Breyer,74, who says he has no ambitions to be appointed to a higher court, is presiding over complex litigation involving hundreds of thousands of car owners who want the company to fix their cars or buy them back, as well as civil suits brought by car dealers and by the Department of Justice. It is a career highlight for someone who had long aspired to be center stage, just not always in the courtroom. While his brother followed their father, a longtime counsel to the San Francisco school board, into law, Charles Breyer initially hoped to pursue a career in acting. After graduating from Harvard University with an economics degree, he spent the summer auditioning, including on Broadway. 201cI never got a callback, 201d he said wryly in an interview last week. Instead, he went to law school at the University of California, Berkeley, and found that trial law 201cwas theatrics by another name. 201d He cut his teeth as an assistant district attorney in San Francisco, often prosecuting homicide cases. Then, in a forerunner to the Watergate scandal, burglars broke into a psychiatrist 2019s office in California in search of records that could damage Daniel Ellsberg, who had leaked the Pentagon Papers and antagonized the Nixon administration. He prosecuted several Nixon aides, who became central figures in the Watergate case, for that break-in. 201cIt was fascinating, 201d he recalled. 201cYou did have a sense that you were engaged in a significant inquiry. You had no sense whatsoever of whether you were going to be successful. None. 201d Breyer later became a trial lawyer in San Francisco, with clients ranging from the American Cigar Co. to the estate of Elvis Presley. He remained mostly in private practice until President Clinton appointed him to the federal bench in 1997. He still has a passion for performance. Breyer has been known to quote Shakespeare in his courtroom, and, like his brother, he regularly draws chuckles in court. Last month, when a lawyer for Volkswagen, Robert J. Giuffra Jr., mentioned that his son disliked the case because his father was never home, Breyer responded: 201cIn a month 2019s time, we will reintroduce you to your family. They can all come to San Francisco for an environmentally correct holiday. 201d Last year, Breyer presided over a long-running case between Hewlett-Packard and its shareholders over an acquisition. The technology company filed several motions to seal already heavily redacted documents, which he denied 2014 with his own reasoning redacted. That was 201cpretty Breyerish, 201d said Josh A. Cohen, a former clerk for Breyer who now works for the law firm Clarence, Dyer, & Cohen in San Francisco. A settlement in the Hewlett-Packard case was reached last year. Breyer is 201cjust very, very effective at cutting straight to the core of an issue, and wading through the marginal, peripheral atmospherics, 201d Cohen said. The judge, he added, likes to move things along quickly and naturally, and toward a settlement if possible. As a senior district judge for the Northern District of California, Breyer has presided over a long line of complex litigation that has often ended in settlements. Last year, he approved settlements in a major class-action case involving accusations of price-fixing in the airline industry. In another major case, involving liability claims regarding two painkillers made by Pfizer, a settlement was announced in 2008. While he rarely gets automotive cases, in 2014, Breyer dismissed a complaint by shareholders of Tesla Motors claiming that the electric carmaker had made false statements about the fire risks of the car batteries. In dismissing it, Breyer said he was at a 201ctotal loss 201d for 201cunderstanding the basis for this lawsuit. 201d The case is being appealed. A multidistrict panel of judges assigned the Volkswagen case to Breyer, in part because California has a higher number of affected cars than other states. Perhaps more important, he is 201cthoroughly familiar with the nuances of complex, multidistrict litigation, 201d the panel stated. Breyer, known for his bow ties and a love of baseball, declined to comment on the Volkswagen case during the interview in his spacious 17th-floor chambers, which overlook downtown San Francisco. The office contains a host of figurines and knickknacks, a wall of legal books and a small aquarium. Asked whether his deadline of Thursday would be met, he replied simply, 201cI hope so. 201d If it is not, a summer trial could be an uncomfortably rapid timeline for Volkswagen, which is already under immense pressure to find an engineering fix for its cars 2014 if one exists. Jeannine Ginivan, a spokeswoman for the Volkswagen Group of America, wrote in an email that the company is 201ccommitted to resolving the US regulatory investigation as quickly as possible, 201d and to working to earn back the trust of its customers and dealers. Many legal observers expect the case to eventually settle rather than go to trial. Soon after he began presiding over the litigation, Breyer appointed former FBI director and longtime lawyer Robert S. Mueller III to help the various sides come together. In his January order appointing him, the judge said that Mueller had the authority to schedule settlement discussions, and to determine the location and other details of those talks. Mueller is providing regular progress reports to Breyer. 201cAppointing Mueller so early and putting him to work 2014 it just shows you, you 2019ve got a judge who has a plan, 201d said Alan Schulman, a professor in residence at the University of San Diego School of Law. 201cHe 2019s going to move this case forward, rather than let it languish in his court for a decade. 201d  ",

In the video, the homeowner's two barking dogs did little to dissuade the pair from allegedly scouring the house for valuables. (The video is muted, according to a police spokesman, who tells PEOPLE releasing the audio would compromise the ongoing investigation.) Towards the end of the footage, the two suspects seem to stop dead in their tracks, as if spooked by something. Police confirm the home's owner has remote access to his surveillance system, and watched the entire incident unfold live before addressing the men on the intercom system. At that point, police say, the startled men are seen running for the doors. We shall not repeat what was said [by the homeowner] , but needless to say the burglars read the message loud and clear, reads a statement from the state police. Police say the two suspects made off with a lockbox that contained jewelry and personal documents.

   "input": "Seventeen-year-old Lorde has been in a whirlwind since an EP of her music was posted on Soundcloud in November 2012. After some 60,000 free copies were downloaded, Universal Music Group, to which she'd been signed since the age of 13, decided to release it formally. That was a year ago this week. Then came Pure Heroine , her debut album , which also included the tracks from her EP; the album was nominated for four Grammys, with Royals winning Song of the Year. Now Lorde is headlining her first U.S. concert tour; it opened here Monday night. Pure Heroine presents Lorde 2014who was born Ella Marija Lani Yelich-O'Connor in Takapuna , New Zealand 2014as an artist not merely emerging but in full bloom. Her lyrics reveal her as a wise young woman with a wary worldview and a dry wit. As a vocalist, her delivery is her most winning trait: Avoiding pyrotechnics, it balances confidence and a trace of innocence. With sparse, percussive arrangements designed by Ms. Yelich-O'Connor and producer Joel Little to emphasize her strengths, Pure Heroine unfolds as a formidable work. Studying good writing , Ms. Yelich-O'Connor said during a conversation prior to her show, helped sharpen her skills as a lyricist. When I was 14 , I began to read a lot of short fiction, and I had such a reaction to it. The words were where they should be, she recalled. I'd read Tobias Wolfe stories out loud to figure out what he was doing to make things rise or crash the way they did. Friends called on her to edit their schoolwork , but then groused when she demanded precision. I became very particular. Until she began working with Mr. Little , Ms. Yelich-O'Connor was reluctant to circulate her writing. I never showed my lyrics to my parents. At some point , Joel said: 'This is good. You know how to put words together.' When I look back, I wasn't very good, but after six months with him, I'd begun to improve. And I started to have experiences that I wanted to write about. Royals was a turning point. In the song , Ms. Yelich-O'Connor scorns the role of materialism in today's pop scene. It was a big idea to fit into a song that's pretty short , she said. But I attacked it like a story or an essay. Selling some five million copies so far , it's the kind of enormous hit that can define a career before it's begun, but as Ms. Yelich-O'Connor points out, she's had two other hits in the U.S. since: Tennis Court , which opens Pure Heroine , and Team. I'm green enough that I'm afraid I'll wake up one day and it'll be gone , she said of her way with words. I still ask myself: Is my life interesting enough to write about? Though she sang Royals at the Grammys ceremony in late January before a huge crowd at Los Angeles's Staples Center and to some 28.5 million viewers on television , Ms. Yelich-O'Connor said she was still getting used to live performance. On Monday at the Austin Music Hall, she was accompanied by Ben Barter on drums, Jimmy McDonald on keyboards, and recordings of her voice as overdubbed during the Pure Heroine sessions to serve as a choir. Ms. Yelich-O'Connor's limited repertoire compelled her to reinvent , however modestly, some of her songs. Mr. Barter punched through the waves of synthesized sounds on a reading of Biting Down , and a tweaked arrangement of Buzzcut Season created tension that was released at its catchy chorus. On Bravado , Ms. Yelich-O'Connor sang to delicate single notes by Mr. McDonald. Her cover of the Replacements' Swingin' Party gave her a chance to show how she can make another composer's song her own. Earlier , Ms. Yelich-O'Connor waved off comparisons to other contemporary concert artists. I'm too weird as a performer to copy anyone else , she said. I kind of thrash around. It's unsettling to look at. But I can't dance. All true , it turned out, as the show progressed, but she never surrendered to affectation. The 70-minute concert built to an exquisite end, with vibrant readings of Ribs and Team bookending a subdued Royals. By the time the confetti floated down from the ceiling during the finale , Ms. Yelich-O'Connor had overcome the sonic limitations of her prerecorded sounds and two-man band to hint at her potential as a live performer. As she continues to develop, it's likely her preternatural talent and self-possession will carry her through. If you believe in yourself , she said , you think what you've done is all right. And then other people might think it's all right too. Mr. Fusilli is the Journal's rock and pop music critic. Email him at jfusilli@wsj.com and follow him on Twitter @wsjrock.

And the category of swimwear is no different 2014 tags in bathing suits typically say 201cmade in China, 201d or Thailand, or Vietnam 2014 countries known for using sweatshop labor. But as the ethical and sustainable fashion movements gain steam, many startups are producing swimwear in nontraditional ways 2013 sweatshop free and using what they say are more ecologically sound materials. Even a legacy brand as massive as Speedo is beginning to sell sustainable swimwear made from recycled materials. Speedo just debuted its PowerFLEX Eco swimwear collection. It is completely made with ECONYL Nylon 6, a fabric made from 201cend-of-life waste material, 201d such as old carpets and abandoned fishing nets. Speedo claims the swimsuits are sturdier, lasting ten times longer than traditional swimwear. Speedo 2019s leftover manufacturing scraps are upcycled by the nylon manufacturer Aquafil into ECONYL nylon, diverting it from the landfill. These scraps are normally not reused as their composition is too complex, but ECONYL process blends those scraps with other fibers to create this fabric. 201cWe are challenging apparel manufacturers to be more sustainable and restructure their supply chain to divert waste from landfill, 201d said Giulio Bonazzi, Chairman and CEO of Aquafil. The range retails for the same as the preexisting PowerFLEX line: $40 2013 $49 for men 2019s models and $68 2013 $79 for women 2019s. If swimwear industry giant Speedo changes the way they make swimsuits, will it become the fashion? So far, other big names like Adidas and the luxury lingerie label La Perla use ECONYL fabric too, as well as Outerknown, a clothing and swimwear line that debuted last month from surfing champion Kelly Slater. The changing face of swimwear is more populated by small, indie-sized brands, like Bikini Empire, a line of surfer-designed separates for women made in Canada. Or Tara Grinna, which is made by hand at a family owned factory in Conway, SC. There are similar swimwear lines made in the US, Canada, and Indonesia, as well as numerous other lines manufactured in the UK. Generally, the lines retail for $100 2013 $150 per suit. 201cThe reason Bikini Empire chose to shore-up and produce our bikinis in Canada was certainly not 201d to save money, said Monica Rush. She and her twin sister, Kelsey Rush, are producing Bikini Empire, sweatshop-free in Vancouver 2014 and recently funded another round of swimwear with a Kickstarter campaign which raised $25,765 CAD, or about $19,300. Rush estimates they pay 6 to 12 times more to make each piece than a typical fast-fashion swimsuit costs to manufacture. 201cAfter two successful collections under our belt in 2014 and 2015, we needed to expand our production to meet demand for our 2016 line, 201d Rush said. 201cHowever, because we are a small business, and producing locally isn 2019t cheap, we did not have the capital to pay for the production increase up front. For this we turned to Kickstarter. 201d They 2019re on their second collection ranging like their peers 2019 products at $110 2013 $120. 201cFortunately consumers are starting to look for and demand ethically made goods, and we believe that it 2019s our responsibility to raise the bar, 201d she continued. 201cAs a small company this can be hard, and competing with the prices of fast fashion can be hard. 201d Since their suits can last five seasons, they encourage repeat customers by using enticing color combinations and solid, practical design. 201cSince we are both avid surfers, we realized that there was a lot of room for improvement in terms of how a suit is designed to work with the water, 201d she says.

   "input": "WASHINGTON, May 29 2014 President Bush vowed today that the federal government would spend $235 million to buy back oil and natural gas rights in the Everglades and off the white-sand beaches of the Florida Panhandle. Administration officials said the agreement, if approved by Congress, would ultimately protect about 765,000 acres in three preserves in the Everglades, the Big Cypress National Preserve, Florida Panther National Wildlife Refuge and Ten Thousand Islands National Wildlife Refuge. Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida said the action made sense for the environment but acknowledged that it was also likely to help his re-election campaign. As the two Bush brothers sat side by side in the Oval Office, the president announced a proposal to pay the wealthy Collier family of Florida about $120 million for mineral rights under the three preserves, which are home to several endangered species. President Bush also announced an agreement to pay $115 million to three oil companies, including the ChevronTexaco Corporation, to buy out offshore oil and gas leases, effectively preventing drilling about 25 miles south of Pensacola. Florida politicians of both parties have joined state voters to fiercely resist drilling off the coast for nearly two decades, setting the state apart from Gulf states like Texas, Alabama and Louisiana, which have welcomed offshore drilling. Facing a similar outcry over the prospect of drilling near the Florida Keys off southwestern Florida, the Clinton administration in 1995 bought back 73 leases for about $200 million. ''Florida is known worldwide for its beautiful coastal waters and the Everglades,'' President Bush said in a statement issued after a 20-minute meeting in the Oval Office. ''Today we are acting to preserve both.'' Environmental groups praised the president's plan, but some said it was politically motivated. ''It's a great move for Florida, but it's essentially a $235 million campaign contribution from the taxpayer's pocket to re-elect Jeb Bush,'' said Philip Clapp, the president of the National Environmental Trust. Other environmentalists said the president's decision reflected a double standard, particularly when the Bush administration has moved aggressively to open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil and gas drilling, a policy rejected last month by the Senate. ''We hope this signals a change in the administration's approach to energy security,'' said Lisa Speer, a policy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York. Both Jeb Bush and administration officials said today that there was nothing inconsistent about a White House that was effectively opposed to drilling in Florida and in favor of it in Alaska. ''I find nothing ironic about it at all,'' Jeb Bush said. ''Each one of these cases needs to be looked at in terms of the balance -- to preserve the natural environment or the economic interests of a state.'' Governor Bush made no effort to dispute the political benefits. Asked if his 2002 campaign would benefit from his brother's action, he replied, ''I hope so.'' Then he added, ''But more importantly, it is good public policy, and when here's a convergence of good politics and good public policy, I don't think we should be ashamed about it.'' Representative Mark Foley, Republican of Florida, said today that there was ''no question'' that today's action would help the president's re-election chances in Florida, which he won by only 537 votes in 2000. The White House said the president had based his decision on community opinion. ''The president believes it is important to work closely with states and local communities and listen to their concerns,'' said Scott McClellan, a White House spokesman. ''In Alaska, there is strong state and local community support for opening a small portion of ANWR to environmentally responsible exploration.'' David B. Struhs, Florida's secretary of environmental protection, said Jeb Bush did not have to lean hard on his brother to oppose drilling in Florida. ''Let's put it this way,'' Mr. Struhs said. ''There were 16 million Floridians all leaning in the same direction. Jeb Bush was 16 million and one.'' Congressional aides said today that approval of the agreement on the Everglades was not assured, suggesting that there could be resistance on both fiscal and political grounds. Under the proposal, the Colliers, a pioneer Florida family with vast landholdings in the state, would transfer mineral rights on about 347,000 acres that it could have explored for oil in exchange for $120 million in cash or credits for future oil bids. The deal was negotiated between the administration and descendants of Barron Gift Collier, who used a fortune built in streetcar advertising in the early 1900's to buy 1.3 million acres of southwestern Florida that eventually became Collier and Hendry Counties. The family has over the years turned over 260,000 acres to the government through swaps, sales and donations, including the original 76,000 acres for Big Cypress. Family members have made contributions to President Bush and Republican causes but have also supported Democratic candidates. The payment to the three companies will settle a suit brought in July 2000 by Chevron, Conoco Inc. and the Murphy Exploration and Production Company, a unit of the Murphy Oil Corporation. The companies said they were being blocked from extracting oil and natural gas from tracts that the federal government sold them in the 1980's. Two of 11 leases in a geologic formation known as the Destin Dome would be reserved for possible exploration by Murphy after 2012 but only if the state and federal governments agreed. Longtime opponents of drilling welcomed the agreement. ''We think this is a fantastic victory for Florida's coast,'' said Mark Ferrulo, director of the Florida Public Interest Research Group. While he said the opponents would have preferred that all 11 leases be relinquished, he said the group could ''live with'' the suspension of the two leases until 2012 as long as the state had veto power over drilling. Fred R. Gorell, a spokesman for ChevronTexaco, said the payments would allow the company to recover its expenses on the project. ''While we are very disappointed that we will not be able to develop the Destin Dome resource, this settlement address the concerns of the parties involved and reimburses us for the investment we have made to date,'' Mr. Gorell said, adding that his company's share of the money would be $46 million. According to the suit filed in 2000, the companies acquired the leases for $10.5 million but spent heavily on exploration activities, increasing their investment to an estimated $100 million.

Before you leave the job 2013or soon thereafter 2013take a moment to send your boss a quick note or e-mail with your new contact information, mentioning also that you hope you can stay in touch. No matter if you never hear back; at least you did your part. Also, take the high road when people ask you about your former boss. Gossiping and bad-mouthing him brings back negative thoughts and doesn 2019t serve your reputation in the long run, says Mackay. It 2019s worth examining how and why the employer-employee relationship turned so sour. Forget about her tone of voice and hooded eyes. The real lesson is: was there a kernel of truth in your boss 2019 criticisms about your organizational skills or lack of leadership? If so, make the internal change so that you don 2019t carry them over to your new job. In the wake of this self-assessment, take the time to also focus on what you 2019re good at. 201cAfter I left my job with a bad boss, I took a personal development class, and it really helped improve my confidence and how I was presenting myself to others, 201d says Levit, who recommends Dale Carnegie leadership seminars. And the more you can get some positive feedback from your new boss, the more confident you 2019ll feel. Ask for a three-month review and weekly check-in and other ways to keep the lines of communication open.

   "input": "Living amid wild animals is not easy, especially when the animal in your backyard is a large elephant. Many elephants now live in densely-populated areas, because farms and plantations have expanded into their traditional homes. To the elephants, crops are easy and nutritious meals. But that's not how farmers see it. Elephants raid crops, damage property, and sometimes kill people. To avoid confrontations and protect their crops, farmers in Africa and Asia have traditionally used several tricks to scare off elephants, like beating drums, firing gunshots into the air or bursting firecrackers. But elephants are intelligent and persistent, and not easily put off. So people resort to poisoning or shooting the elephants. This is bad for all concerned. So now researchers are experimenting with new strategies that can detect elephants early, and deter them from raiding people's properties. No guns are involved. African elephants are afraid of bees, especially the aggressive African honey bees. These bees' stings can be extremely painful even for the thick-skinned elephants, especially inside their trunk or around their eyes. In 2002, researchers found that African elephants stay away from acacia trees with beehives. Later studies showed that not only do the elephants run away from the sound of buzzing bees, they also emit low-frequency alarm calls to alert family members about the possible threat. In 2007, researchers began testing beehive fences as possible elephant deterrents in Kenya. The fence consists of beehives hung every 10 m, linked by wires. When an elephant touches the fence, the beehives swing, unleashing a swarm of angry bees. The initial study was so successful that farmers extended the fences on their own initiative. They are particularly good at stopping raids by overwhelmingly large groups of elephants. Farmers in Tanzania, Mozambique, Botswana and Sri Lanka are now trying the fences. Honey and other bee products earn the farmers additional income. I'm pretty sure our beehive fence method is the only elephant deterrent fence that actually helps to make the farmer money , says Lucy King of the charity Save the Elephants. If you don't fancy living with bees , you could scare elephants away using the sound of angry tigers. On hearing the tiger growls, the elephants silently retreated In southern India, tigers and elephants often live side by side. While tigers don't usually hunt elephants due to their size, they have been known to kill elephant calves. So elephants are wary of tigers. In 2010, Vivek Thuppil, then at the University of California-Davis and now at the University of Nottingham, recorded the aggressive growls of a captive tiger and leopard, and played them to elephants frequenting villages around two protected areas in southern India. Whenever the elephants ventured close to crop fields, they tripped an infrared beam, triggering playbacks of the growls. On hearing the agitated tiger growls, the elephants silently retreated. Thuppil is now developing a low-cost playback system that the farmers can use as elephant deterrents. We hope to 2026 make commercially available devices a reality by this time next year , he says. Elephants don't like chillis. Capsaicin , the chemical in chillis that makes them hot, is an irritant, causing elephants to cough, sneeze and eventually turn away. So some farmers in Africa protect their crops from elephants by planting buffers of chilli plants around them. The chillis also earn them extra money. The Elephant Pepper Development Trust in Cape Town, South Africa, teaches farmers to make rope fences smeared with waste engine oil and red chilli, and mounted with cowbells, to deter elephants. Asian farmers are also experimenting with chilli. Farmers in southern India use a combination of dry hay, tobacco, and dry red chili pods and seeds wrapped up in newspapers to create pungent smoke. In north-east India, conservationists have gone a step further and tried using ghost chillis, or bhut jolokias, one of the hottest chillis in the world. However, chilli-based methods do not work alone and perform best when combined with other deterrents. Whatever the technique , it always works better when the farmer is present in his crop field, says Prachi Mehta of the Wildlife Research and Conservation Society in Pune , India. Unguarded fields are like an open invitation to the elephants. If you share your home with elephants , it helps to know their whereabouts and keep a safe distance. So researchers have hit upon a simple and ingenious early warning system. In the Valparai plateau of southern India, about 100 elephants live amid tea and coffee plantations and fragments of rainforest. They have killed 41 people in the region, nearly 76% of them after surprise encounters. To avoid such accidents, the Nature Conservation Foundation (NCF) in Mysore, India, has begun tracking the elephants. In 2011, they developed a simple SMS-based system to warn people about approaching elephants. If someone spots an elephant, they call up NCF, which then texts the elephant's location to people living within 2 km of it. For people without a mobile phone, the team has also set up red LED flashing lights in 24 strategic points, where people are more likely to encounter elephants. Each light has a SIM card that can be operated by certain people's mobile numbers. If they spot an elephant, these people can turn on the nearest light by dialling its number. These flashing lights warn people returning home in the dark, when elephants are not easily visible. Thanks to the early warning system, there were no injuries or deaths in 2013, says project leader Ananda Kumar of NCF. Finally, you can simply eavesdrop on the elephants. They often communicate with each other in low-frequency rumbles. These infrasonic sounds can travel several km, so if you can listen in you can spot the elephants from miles away. It doesn't work if the elephants fall silent Researchers are now developing an early warning system that can detect elephants based on their infrasonic vocalizations. Angela St 00f6ger-Horwath from the University of Vienna and her colleagues have shown that the low-frequency calls can not only help detect elephants, they reveal whether the elephants are infants, calves, juveniles or adults. The system is not in use yet , St 00f6ger-Horwath says. The next step is the production of a prototype. If it works , the elephants could be driven off long before they enter the village to eat the crops, says St 00f6ger-Horwath. The one drawback is that it doesn't work if the elephants fall silent.

   "input": "The federal government has changed its transmission guidelines for the Ebola virus, out of concern that the disease may be spread via sexual intercourse for a longer period of time. On Sunday, the U.S. Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated its guidelines due to evidence suggesting Ebola may last longer in semen than experts initially thought. The CDC previously recommended Ebola survivors abstain from sex for three months, the time Ebola was thought to remain in semen; the new guidelines recommend survivors abstain or have sex with a condom for the foreseeable future until 201cmore information becomes available. 201d According to the New York Times, a Liberian man who survived Ebola may have passed the virus on to his wife after many months. Genetic material from Ebola was identified in the man 2019s sperm 175 days after he had developed symptoms, which is 74 days more than any other case studied. The issue raises some questions that perhaps you 2019re too squeamish to ask. The answers to these questions were provided by CDC spokesperson Salina Smith and have been updated to reflect the latest news. 1. Why does Ebola survive in semen longer than blood? Semen and blood are different types of body fluids, and scientifically, the testes are known as immunologically 201cprivileged 201d sites. Basically it 2019s easier for the virus to hide and avoid being attacked by the immune system in the reproductive system. 2. Why is someone deemed 201ccured 201d of the virus if it 2019s negative in their blood, but positive in their semen? Theoretically it 2019s possible that Ebola could be transmitted via contact with Ebola-positive semen, but there is no evidence to date that this has ever happened until recently. It may be that the virus is a more efficient transmitter in blood. What we know for a fact is that exposure to blood that 2019s positive for Ebola can infect other people. 3. Does the CDC explicitly recommend abstinence to every patient who survives Ebola? The patient and his partner are well counseled on this, and must have it clearly explained to them. A CDC medical team is currently supposed to provide them with enough condoms for that period. The CDC recommends this warning also be included on the patient 2019s discharge papers. 4. Does the CDC ever test patients 2019 semen? The CDC does test the semen of patients who are medically evacuated to the United States. The agency also asks if patients in the United States would like to have their semen tested periodically so that the CDC can gain a better idea of how long the virus lasts.  ",

The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet sent an email on Wednesday informing women on the 201cAppointWomen 201d register that it was being decommissioned and advising of other websites they could use if they were still interested in appointment to a government board or decision-making body. But the email addresses of all of the thousands of women who had been registered with 201cAppointWomen 201d were included.

In response to questions from Guardian Australia a departmental spokesperson said: 201cAppointWomen is a now defunct database of women seeking appointment to a government board.

For example, BoardLinks ensures only women who are highly qualified for board positions are put forward as they require endorsement by either a minister, departmental secretary or designated BoardLinks champion (from business and the not-for-profit sectors). Decommissioning AppointWomen and strengthening efforts around BoardLinks will assist to streamline government resources and make sourcing high-quality candidates more effective. 201d Figures released in late 2015 showed the proportion of women on federal government boards has dropped slightly to 39.1% of positions held by women but that figure remains close to the government 2019s target of having at least 40% of Australian government board positions held by women.

In international markets, several studios and television producers are providing a wide range of pay-TV streaming services outside of traditional cable connections, Bloomberg is reporting, citing sources with knowledge of the companies 2019 plans. Several prominent companies, including Viacom VIAB and Walt Disney DIS , are finding ways to provide their content to customers who aren 2019t so willing to pay for traditional television services, the report claims. So-called a la carte television has become a hot topic in the world of entertainment. Companies around the globe are analyzing ways to provide customers with the content they care about without forcing them into cable subscriptions that include a slew of channels they don 2019t. While in the U.S., such a plan has been slow-going, the Bloomberg report claims it 2019s making significant inroads in Europe and Latin America, where cable and satellite companies don 2019t have an iron-like grip on content. Get Data Sheet, Fortune 2019s technology newsletter. The idea of providing a la carte television is something that many people might be interested in. Cable and satellite companies provide services that offer easy access to content. However, much of that content is viewed by precious few people. That 2019s why an increasing number of people around the U.S. are opting to 201ccut the cord 201d and back away from traditional television services. A survey from video-discovery firm DigitalSmiths last summer found that approximately 8% of Americans have already nixed their pay-TV subscriptions in favor of streaming services like HBO Go, a jump from approximately 7% in 2014. That report was followed in September by a study from research firm Magid Associates that found the number of people at least considering cutting the cord was on the rise. In response, several companies have delivered streaming apps, including HBO, CBS CBS , and others. It 2019s also been reported that Apple aapl has been working hard at providing American users the option to stream a few dozen channels that are most popular in a bid to target cable and satellite companies. So far, however, the company has been unable to come to an agreement. Apple 2018Frustrated 2019 by TV Streaming Negotiations Overseas, things appear to be different. According to Bloomberg, Fox has already launched a service, called Fox Play, that lets cable and satellite customers in Latin America watch its programming. Several other media companies are selling monthly services to customers who want access to the programming they care about. The issue is one of significant concern to cable and satellite companies in the U.S. Traditionally, customers have simply paid their providers for access to programming. Now, they want to watch only certain content, and do so wherever they are. That has contributed to the growing popularity of services like Netflix NFLX , Hulu, and Amazon 2019s AMZN own streaming platform. It 2019s also prompted traditional providers to consider offering content in new ways, including offering an entire season of a TV show at once, similar to moves by Netflix and Amazon. For more on Netflix, watch: Still, there are no signs of pay-TV providers in the U.S. losing their control anytime soon. Indeed, many of them have a firm grip on the market and don 2019t want to dramatically change their businesses. According to Bloomberg 2019s sources, providers don 2019t have the same level of control in other markets, giving the content creators opportunities to launch their own services. It 2019s unclear what 2019s next for the pay-TV market in the U.S., but if content providers have their way, an increasing number of streaming services will be made available as more people cut the cord. The onus will then be on those providers to respond.  ",

The Oxford Dictionaries went so far as to name one emoji the word of the year in 2015, saying the Japanese-born characters are 201ca nuanced form of expression, and one which can cross language barriers. 201d But this international lexicon has one big problem: No one can agree on exactly what 2019s being said when we send each other emojis. A new study from a group of computer scientists at the University of Minnesota found that people interpret the exact same emoji faces in very different ways. In the study, researchers talked to 334 people across the U.S. who analyzed emojis from Apple, Google, Microsoft, Samsung, and LG. The researchers asked the participants what they thought the emojis meant, how they would describe them, and how they might use them. And they found that about 25% of the time, even when people are viewing the exact same emoji picture on the exact same kind of device, they disagree about whether the emotion being conveyed by the emoji is positive, negative, or neutral. Get Data Sheet, Fortune 2019s technology newsletter. Add in the fact that emojis can change expressions slightly depending on what kind of phone a user has, and it 2019s pretty impossible to know for sure how someone is going to interpret one of your emoji texts. One of the most confusing emoji offenders is this ridiculous, toothy 201cgrinning face with smiling eyes. 201d GroupLens Research, University of Minnesota People in the study often described this face on Google 2019s system as 201cblissfully friendly, 201d while Apple 2019s toothy face is seen as feistier and more 201cready to fight. 201d But even among Apple users people can 2019t seem to agree: Is the face grinning or grimacing? And the toothy face isn 2019t the only one people are confused about. The most emotionally confusing Apple emoji around, according to the research?

But even that doesn 2019t always seem to help: 201cPeople miscommunicate all the time, it 2019s not about emoji, 201d argues study author Jacob Thebault-Spieker. Still, the authors say companies could do more to clear up at least some of the emoji confusion. They might develop a kind of emoji translation tool, so people on different platforms can see their friends 2019 emojis in the same format as they were sent. (A Samsung user, for example, would see an emoji from an iPhone 2019s sender displayed just as it is on its iPhone, and vice versa.)

This week he was forced to cancel a rally in Chicago after thousands of demonstrators, many of them Hispanics, infiltrated the hall where he was set to speak. Mr Trump also cancelled a rally in Miami, which has a large Hispanic population, which was scheduled for Monday. In Kansas, police used pepper spray on protestors at a Trump event. The protests came just as Mr Trump had begun to moderate his tone. His performance in a recent debate had been decidedly restrained.

As his political rivals highlighted last week, for all his talk about bringing jobs back to America, Mr Trump has continued to employ foreign labourers in his Mar-a-Lago luxury Florida resort. As the Telegraph saw when browsing in his store in Trump Tower in New York, much of Mr Trump 2019s brand merchandise (including some of his 2018Make America Great Again 2019 campaign hats) is made in China or Bangladesh.

Barack Obama moved closer to becoming the Democratic candidate to challenge the presumptive GOP nominee in November. Sen. John McCain compared his policies with those of Sen. Barack Obama in a speech Tuesday night. No matter who wins this election , the direction of this country is going to change dramatically. But the choice is between the right change and the wrong change, between going forward and going backward, he said. In the speech , McCain drew upon themes from his campaign and contrasted them with those of the junior senator, citing his inexperience. The American people didn't get to know me yesterday , as they are just getting to know Sen. Obama, he said. They know I have a long record of bipartisan problem-solving. They've seen me put our country before any president , before any party, before any special interest -- before my own interest. McCain called for widespread and innovative reforms in health care , energy, the environment, taxes, public education, transportation, disaster relief, regulation, diplomacy and military and intelligence services. Watch McCain's case for change 00bb He called for government to rethink , reform and reinvent many of its policies and improve its ability to respond to natural calamity , eliciting loud applause from the Louisiana audience. McCain also he accused Obama of favoring policies that relied on government interference and failed policies from the past. The right change recognizes that many of the policies and institutions of our government have failed. They have failed to keep up with the challenges of our time because many of these policies were designed for the problems and opportunities of the mid- to late 20th century , before the end of the Cold War, before the revolution in information technology and rise of the global economy, he said. McCain rejected the Democratic strategy to tie him to President Bush's policies , noting his opposition to Bush's initial policies in Iraq, his energy policy and his climate change policy. He also referred to reports of success in Iraqi-led efforts to combat insurgency and cited statistics showing that the death toll for American troops in Iraq was at its lowest in four years. All of this progress would have been lost if Sen. Obama had his way and began to withdraw , McCain said. McCain also accused Obama of not taking failing to stand up against the partisan rancor on both sides of the Senate floor. He is an impressive man who makes a great first impression , he said. But he hasn't been willing to make the tough calls , to challenge his party, to risk criticism from his supporters to bring real change to Washington. I have. Finally , McCain will call for Republicans and Democrats to work together. Pundits and party elders have declared that Sen. Obama will be my opponent , McCain said. He will be a formidable one. But I'm ready for the challenge and determined to run this race in a way that does credit to our campaign and to the proud , decent and patriotic people I ask to lead.

We are absolutely going to have to provide fiscal security to people, we are going to have to show the country and the world that the government can live within its means, he told BBC radio on Tuesday. The chancellor said it was key that Britain provided fiscal stability in the wake of the decision to exit the EU which has seen sterling plunge and markets tumble. We are in a prolonged period of economic adjustment in the UK , we are adjusting to life outside the EU and it will not be as economically rosy as life inside the EU, he said. I think we can provide a clear plan. Asked if that plan meant tax rises and spending cuts , he said: Yes , absolutely. But that decision will come under a new prime minister - it's obviously not possible while the Conservative Party is having a leadership contest. Osborne accepted that his prominent role in the Remain campaign has ended his chances of a move to Number 10 and conceded that the pro-EU push did not get it all right. He appeared to hint that he could support Theresa May - who backed Remain but did not play a prominent role in the campaign. Asked if someone from the pro-EU side could win , Osborne told BBC Radio 4: Absolutely. I am not backing any candidate at the moment but of course I was full-throttled in arguing for remaining in the EU and because half my party wanted to leave the EU I don't think I can be the person who can bring the party together. He said the best PM would be the candidate who is able now to articulate the clearest , crispest version of what relationship we are seeking - which in my view involves the best possible terms of trade for services and goods.

   "input": "Jul 8, 2016 11:40 AM EDT U.S. RICHMOND, Va. -- The pendant around Patrick Lawson's neck reads all things are possible. That's the hope that has kept him going since his 2-year-old daughter was placed on life support after choking on a popcorn kernel in May. Doctors at a Virginia hospital say they're certain Mirranda Grace Lawson won't recover , and they want to perform a test they believe will confirm she's brain dead. The hospital and experts say the test is harmless. But Lawson and his wife have refused, saying they worry the test will harm the girl. They believe she'll open her big blue eyes again one day. We feel that God has told us that it's his will that she is going to awaken , Patrick Lawson said. She has something to do in this world. Before May 11 , Mirranda Lawson was an outgoing, bubbly toddler with a smile that stopped passers-by, Patrick Lawson said. On his wife's birthday, Patrick Lawson took a day off from work to spend time with his family at their home on a small farm in Fauquier County. The toddler somehow got her hand in a bag of popcorn they were eating and choked, he said. The kernel obstructed her airway and she went into cardiac arrest. Her father performed CPR until paramedics arrived and intubated the child. After doctors with the Virginia Commonwealth University Health System informed the Lawsons that Mirranda was likely brain dead, the family went to court to block the hospital from conducting the so-called apnea test. It involves taking the toddler off the ventilator briefly to see if her brain tries to tell the body to breathe on its own. In a handwritten note to doctors, the Lawsons expressed opposition to the test. They cited their Christian faith and said removing her from life support would be murder. The Richmond Circuit Court ruled against the Lawsons last month , but allowed them to pay a $30,000 bond barring the hospital from conducting the test while the family appeals to the Virginia Supreme Court. VCU Health System is now seeking court permission to conduct the test soon, arguing hospital resources are limited. VCU Medical Center's Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, or PICU, has just 14 beds and providing care for Mirranda Lawson costs nearly $10,000 a day, the hospital says. Having one of the PICU beds and all the human resources that entails , occupied by Mirranda, who has likely been dead for weeks, jeopardizes the care of critically ill children that VCU Health System is being forced to turn away, a health system attorney wrote. Such cases are exceedingly rare , said Arthur Caplan, of the division of medical ethics at New York University's School of Medicine. But legal fights over children on life support have erupted in other states as far off as California. Hospitals typically don't even ask before performing such routine tests, Caplan said. You'd have chaos if doctors were asking permission to do every test relative to the determination of death , he said. VCU doctors say the ventilator and medicines are the only things keeping Mirranda Lawson's heart and lungs functioning. One of the girl's doctors said in court that it would be astounding if she were able to breathe without the machine. The hospital says in court documents that all clinical tests conducted on Mirranda have been consistent with brain death. The hospital also says that Virginia law indicates doctors could conclude the girl is brain dead without further testing , but that it is complying with national guidelines by pursuing the apnea test to give the parents absolute confirmation. But Patrick Lawson said he believes Mirranda is improving. He said her heart rate and blood pressure respond to her favorite music and her family's voices , but the hospital said it can't disclose any details about that because of privacy laws. They want her doctors to give her a portable ventilator and feeding tube so she can be transferred to another hospital or cared for at home. Why not see what can happen? said Alexandra Snyder , executive director of the Life Legal Defense Foundation, a California-based group assisting the Lawsons' attorney. Throughout the apnea test, Mirranda would continue to receive oxygen and be put back on the ventilator at the first sign of any brain stem activity, VCU Health System said in court filings. David Magnus, of the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics, said temporarily taking the child off the ventilator to perform the test shouldn't cause any problems. It's hard to see what grounds the family would have to object unless they simply don't want to hear the bad news that their loved one has passed away , Magnus said. A VCU spokesman said other agencies and hospitals have reviewed Mirranda's case and either couldn't support her intensive care needs or said they wouldn't do anything different than what's being done. This is a difficult situation , spokesman Michael Porter said in an email. Mirranda's medical team and everyone involved want the best for Mirranda and her family. Patrick Lawson says he just wants to give his daughter more time. She was always very strong and determined , he said. She's proving them all wrong.  ",

   "input": "DETROIT 2014 Despite praising automakers for recent gains in fuel economy, two federal agencies said on Monday that surging consumer demand for pickups and sport utility vehicles made it unlikely that the industry could meet the government 2019s ambitious projections a decade from now. If fuel prices remain low, and trucks continue to outsell cars, the industry will probably not meet the goal of 54.5 miles per gallon as a fleetwide average by 2025, but will probably come in at only about 50 miles a gallon, according to a report by the Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency. The report issued on Monday was termed a draft by administration officials, and included input from the California Air Resources Board, as well as the two federal agencies. That lower fuel economy number would translate into higher levels of carbon dioxide emissions, which environmentalists say would make global climate change worse and undercut efforts to curtail greenhouse gases agreed to by the Obama administration in last year 2019s Paris climate accord. The report 2019s release kicks off a lengthy review period for the nation 2019s Corporate Average Fuel Economy program, and sets up a battle between car companies and environmental groups to influence the final mileage rules. Automakers want lower requirements, while clean-air advocates are pushing for big reductions in vehicle emissions. 201cThe 54.5 miles-per-gallon average is at risk, 201d said Daniel Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign in Washington. 201cRather than weaken the projections, the regulators should be tightening the standards for larger vehicles. 201d But automakers say a fair analysis of market conditions is required to set realistic mileage projections for coming years. 201cGetting the midterm review analysis right is crucial for everyone, 201d said Gloria Bergquist, an official with the Alliance for Automotive Manufacturers, which represents a dozen carmakers including General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler. Federal officials said that the midterm review released on Monday was primarily a factual tool to help set final CAFE rules for 2022 to 2025. After a public comment period, the government is expected to complete those mileage standards by early 2018. The agencies said the automakers had exceeded the initial forecasts for fuel-economy improvements set when the latest CAFE rules were set four years ago. 201cAutomakers are developing more technologies to improve fuel economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions than we thought possible a few years ago, 201d said Janet McCabe, a senior E.P.A. official. When the CAFE rules were adopted in 2012, the government set 36.6 miles per gallon as the projection for 2017 model-year vehicles. The industry is on track to meet that number using a complex formula that sets specific mileage standards for vehicles of various sizes. Companies can also improve their CAFE score with credits for technology such as electric cars. But the government 2019s projection of a 54.5 miles-per-gallon average in 2025 is in jeopardy because of a marked shift in demand toward heavier vehicles with lower mileage standards. When the forecast was made four years ago, regulators expected that cars would account for about two-thirds of overall vehicles sales in the United States in 2015. Low gas prices, however, have contributed to increasing demand for lower-mileage models such as pickups and S.U.V.s. In the first six months of this year, for example, trucks and S.U.V.s accounted for 58 percent of all vehicles sales in the United States. The industry successfully lobbied four years ago for the current midterm review period. Ms. Bergquist, of the auto alliance, said that auto companies would incur extra costs if the mileage rules were set too high. 201cExcessive regulatory costs could impact both consumers and the employees who produce these vehicles, 201d she said. Environmental groups vowed to push for the highest possible mileage standards during the public comment period leading up to the final rules. 201cThe national fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards are a vital program to cut oil use and reduce the risk of climate change, 201d said David Cooke of the Union of Concerned Scientists. Obama administration officials said the projections of 54.5 miles per gallon outlined in 2012 were based on different market conditions than those existing today. The officials also said, however, that technological innovations had consistently increased mileage in large and small vehicles. The broadest gains have been in gasoline-powered models, which have benefited from more efficient engines and transmissions, lighter materials and more aerodynamic designs.

It was her husband, German physicist Wilhelm R 00f6ntgen, who discovered X-rays in 1895. The news that someone had found a way of peering through human skin and flesh to look at the skeleton beneath, without so much as touching the subject, was an international sensation. Soon, X-ray photographs revealing bones and even the shadowy impression of internal organs were being published in newspapers around the world. And it wasn 2019t long before the fantasy of X-rays entered popular culture. 201cAround her ribs, those beauteous twenty-four, Her flesh a halo makes, misty in line, Her noseless, eyeless face looks into mine. And I but whisper, 2018Sweetheart, Je t 2019adore 2019, 201d read the lines in one poem published in Life magazine a year after R 00f6ntgen 2019s discovery. X-rays were both sexy and seen as a sort of superpower 2013 an idea eventually made immortal by the 1940s writers of Superman comics. They gave their hero 2013 what else 2013 X-ray vision. But all the while people hoped that the wonder of X-rays could be theirs to play with. The technology was most commonly imagined as a form of X-ray specs that could see through walls. But has anyone ever made it a reality? Long the subject of science fiction, it might now be close to becoming reality. In the months and years after Rontgen made his discovery, there was no shortage of brainstorming around what X-rays might allow people to do. To take one example, in 1896 a magazine in Dundee reported on the musings of the local chief constable who was considering how X-rays might be adapted 201cfor detective purposes 201d. A handheld X-ray device similar to a pair of binoculars could, the magazine suggested, be used to spy into rooms where 201cshebeeners 201d 2013 those who sold alcohol without a licence 2013 were plying their trade. One exhibition promised visitors the ability to 2018see through a sheet of metal 2019 or 2018count the coins within your purse 2019 201cThere 2019s a lot of X-ray fiction around at that time, 201d says Keith Williams, a senior lecturer in English at the University of Dundee. 201cAnd one article about electric waves actually ends with the scientific journalist speculating about the possibility of being able to see through walls into the most intimate spaces and people 2019s most private actions. 201d There were also some more fanciful public demonstrations of X-rays. One exhibition promised visitors the ability to 201csee through a sheet of metal 201d or 201ccount the coins within your purse 201d. In reality, though, early experiments with X-rays were confined to medical and scientific applications. Practitioners delighted in producing photographs of complete animal skeletons or tweaking the technique to create sharper X-ray images. Rontgen himself had been experimenting with a Crookes tube 2013 a scientific instrument which accelerates electrons into a beam known as a cathode ray. A tiny portion of the energy from this process is released as photons. In the electromagnetic spectrum, it 2019s the wavelength of photonic waves that defines whether they are, for example, radio waves, visible light waves or 2013 as in this case 2013 X-rays. A fluorescent screen revealed that Rontgen 2019s rays were passing through some materials, like muscle, but not others 2013 such as bone. Although the harmful effects of frequent exposure to X-rays were soon discovered, the exciting promise of X-ray vision never really went away. X-ray specs, a novelty item often sold via boys 2019 comic books and magazines, were first patented in 1906. The glasses don 2019t use X-rays at all, of course. Instead they create a sort of double vision illusion in which the overlapping of objects suggests 2013 not very convincingly 2013 that they have been penetrated to reveal an internal structure. But in 1998 the promise of X-ray specs took an unexpected technological twist. Sony had been marketing a new range of camcorders with night-vision capabilities 2013 a function the company branded 201cNightShot 201d. A few enthusiasts claimed that under special circumstances it was possible to see through people 2019s clothes to an extent. It was erroneously rumoured at the time that Sony had to recall some of the models in an effort to tackle bad press;in reality the firm just made some modifications to the cameras 2019 design. You can see through bushes and stuff but there 2019s not a whole lot more beyond that 2013 Vince Houghton, International Spy Museum But night-vision equipment continued to be the subject of hobbyists 2019 experiments. One YouTuber has uploaded what appears to be a demonstration of how a Sony camera released in 2002 can be quickly modified with some tape and an infrared filter to achieve the desired 201cX-ray effect 201d. The video shows how the cover of a book 2013 and even his wife 2019s bra (which she declined to demonstrate herself) 2013 can be seen through his black t-shirt. 201cThere ya go, 201d he says, 201cX-ray vision 201d. Night vision works by detecting infrared light, which humans can 2019t normally see, and converting this energy into visible light waves. It might just be that the clothing used in this example reveals more when viewed in infrared, suggests Alistair Brown, product manager at British night vision and thermal imaging firm Thermoteknix. This, he adds, could make it look, 201cvery different from broadband visible wavelengths used by our eyes 201d. Vince Houghton, an ex-US army soldier and historian at the International Spy Museum in Washington DC, frequently used night vision and thermal imaging technologies in the army. But he says the 201cX-ray 201d capabilities are strictly limited. 201cYou can see through bushes and stuff but there 2019s not a whole lot more beyond that, 201d he comments. 201cIf you have a solid structure it 2019s very difficult to see through with infrared. 201d But that doesn 2019t mean there isn 2019t a need for this technology. Houghton gives the example of a hostage situation. 201cIf you can see inside when you decide to finally breach, you know where the bad guys are, 201d he says. Has anyone come up with a device that can do this? The answer, surprisingly, is yes. While X-rays remain impractical for anyone but specialists to play with, military contractors have long been experimenting with them. So much so that the idea once posited by Dundee 2019s 19th Century chief constable has finally come to fruition. A much cheaper and safer technology offering X-ray specs-like capabilities is one you already have in your home 2013 wi-fi 201cThe early experiments with this were these huge bulky machines that were not tactically useful if you 2019re thinking about a military or police operation, 201d explains Houghton. But now police and military personnel have the option to buy a MINI Z X-ray gun 2013 a handheld, 201ceasy to use 201d X-ray device that can peer into vehicles, rooms, bags and packages. 201cAs an operator scans a target, an image appears in real-time on the system 2019s dedicated tablet, 201d boasts manufacturer American Science and Engineering on their website. There is also a web page where anyone can try a virtual demo of the system. Still, the MINI Z isn 2019t available to the average consumer and it costs $50,000. What 2019s more, there have been some concerns that increasing use of X-ray devices by law enforcement might carry health risks to the general public. Similar concerns have been levelled at millimetre-wave scanners 2013 which use microwaves 2013 now installed at many airports. These have faced the added criticism that they are an invasion of privacy, given that operators of some devices are able to see through people 2019s clothes. To combat such fears, US regulation now prohibits the rendering of detailed images. However, a much cheaper and safer technology offering x-ray specs-like capabilities is one you already have in your home 2013 wi-fi. Last year, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology published a video that shows how a custom-built wi-fi transmitter can be used to create a rough image of someone 2013 through a solid wall. 201cWhen you send a wireless signal, it reflects off everything and those reflections come back to you, 201d explains Dina Katabi. Computer software is able to analyse signal reflections and produce an image of the object from which they have emanated. It 2019s possible, of course, that military and intelligence agency personnel are already using advanced versions of this technology for surveillance purposes 201cWe can image how people move about a space, where they sit, how they walk around and also detect falls 2013 which is a big thing for older people, 201d adds Katabi. For Houghton, the technology has a range of potential uses. 201cI know for a fact that some of this technology is already being used for building inspection, 201d he says. 201cYou have the ability to check out wiring and structure. 201d It 2019s possible, of course, that military and intelligence agency personnel are already using advanced versions of this technology for surveillance purposes. 201cAnything that you 2019re seeing in the public news is 10 years behind what the intelligence agencies are probably using, 201d says Houghton. He adds that this effectively means we 2019ve probably come full circle on the century-long dream of X-ray specs. If smart glasses do one day become popular, it 2019s not hard to imagine future, miniaturised versions of these technologies getting built in to wearable devices. What was once a foolish notion in the pages of a comic book may soon become a reality. Even Superman would be amazed.

   "input": "I read Franklin Medhurst 2019s poignant letter with interest and much sadness (16 June). I am an immigrant, of German and Italian nationalities. I grew up in the heart of the EU, as the daughter of EU civil servants. At school, I saw a harmonious mingling of cultures and languages and was taught many subjects in mixed nationality groups in a foreign language (English). When I came to the UK to study, I fell in love 2013 with a man and with Yorkshire 2013 and have stayed ever since. I have made the UK my home. My British husband and I have two tri-nationality (Italian, German, British) daughters. I have worked and paid taxes as an employee and I now run my own business helping improve children 2019s mental health. I contribute to society and have always felt welcome here 2013 until now. The growing wave of angry xenophobia is saddening and maddening. A UK that votes leave is not the UK that I have made my home over the past 26 years. Voting leave is tantamount to saying: 201cI 2019m happy to risk destabilising the longest period of peace Europe has known. 201d It means weakening Europe, and the world, to the threat posed by Putin and by terrorists. I have never felt less welcome here and more frightened. Voting leave is not a mistake that can be undone at the next general election. It is a decision that will have a potentially devastating impact for generations to come. But most of all, voting leave will mean leaving a piece of humanity behind.Frederika RobertsDoncaster 2022 Like many others I share the sentiments of Franklin Medhurst (Report, 17 June) and his understanding about Britain 2019s relationship with our neighbours across the Channel. We must absolutely not go back to a Europe of competing nations and empires but should maintain that essential forum of the EU to resolve any differences, for all its current shortcomings. Reading the press and talking to people, there is a clear view that older citizens will vote to leave the EU. Well, I 2019m 78 years old and will be voting to remain both for the reasons that Mr Medhurst so passionately argued and because the future of this country is not for the elderly but for the young to decide, and most of the young citizens I have talked to have been in favour of remaining. They feel both British and European, as I do. When the Brexit camp talk about 201cGive us back our Britain 201d, what precise model do they have in mind from some past golden age, because as far as I am concerned a vibrant multicultural Britain is far preferable to most of what went before. Certainly, immigration is an issue, but this can be dealt with best from within the EU.David BishopWybunbury, Cheshire 2022 I was just a little too young to serve in the armed forces during the war, and in any case was in a reserved occupation as an aircraft apprentice. But I share Franklin Medhurst 2019s view on the peace and stability the EU has brought to the continent. How different the world would have been had something similar to the EU been created post-1918. However, one point Mr Medhurst did not include in his letter was the contribution of many other nationalities to the cause, for example the Polish fighter pilots in the Battle of Britain. The Polish plumbers and builders that are supposed to be such a threat to our way of life today are their descendants. What I do not understand is why older people are in favour of Brexit, according to the polls. Surely they, like Mr Medhurst and myself, should be the ones to remember all this.Frank JacksonHarlow, Essex 2022 My father fought and died in the second world war. He was killed by a German sniper in a tiny hamlet near Vire in Normandy on 3 August 1944. He was buried in Bayeux. I and my family make frequent visits to the cemetery there. A stark reminder of the horrors of war. To leave the EU would be to betray the legacy of those who gave their lives to secure our freedom. I do not want my father 2019s sacrifice (he was a volunteer) to be sullied by the likes of Michael Gove, Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage. A motley crew of self-serving individuals who are deluding themselves and the public as to what would happen should Britain vote to leave the EU. United we stand. Divided we fall. A cliche, but true in this context.Michele Holmes (aged 73)Wroxham, Norfolk 2022 Unlike Mr Medhurst, I am young and have never fought in a war. Some would argue I 2019ve never fought for anything, probably owing largely to the sacrifices made by men of Mr Medhurst 2019s generation. Yet, I am fighting now. Fighting to persuade whomever I can that leaving Europe is the right choice. Aside from the world wars, there were other European conflicts of the 20th century; countries which fought for independence and political ideals, only now to see the fruits of those struggles usurped by masters of a different kind. What about the peoples of countries conquered during the second world war, people who now only see their former conquerors gain at their expense? Yes, the EU has prevented conflict and created a stability of some kind, but at what cost? Its expanding borders and powers are now increasing the threat of bloc-style conflict with other world powers. As a boy Europe offered the excitement of having such diversity on one 2019s doorstep. Over the last few decades that diversity has been increasingly eroded by centralised European power; a power that increasingly disrespects the histories, cultures and attitudes of individual member states.Paul O 2019SullivanBristol 2022 When I voted in 1945 to help bring in a landslide Labour government, we all believed in a better world. We thought that we had fought for it every day of the last six years. The bombing had laid bare the squalor in which many of us lived. The strange idea of a free health service was put through by a determined Welshman, Aneurin Bevan. It had nothing to do with the rest of Europe, then or now. It is a national treasure and depends entirely on the government of the day. As Jeremy Corbyn says, we should be leading Europe instead of leaving it.Anne Horatia PiperWytham, Oxfordshire 2022 Join the debate 2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com  ",

   "input": "In his first campaign appearance since a crucial loss in New York 2019s primary, Bernie Sanders on Thursday dialed back his rhetoric on Hillary Clinton 2013 only to ramp it back up later in the day. Clinton 2019s rout in New York Tuesday all-but-crushed any remaining hope for Sanders to find a viable path to the Democratic presidential nomination, and many party members hoped the underdog would now ease off Clinton to avoid harming her general election prospects. Morning Joe, 4 21 16, 8:51 AM ET The New York Times 2019 Anand Giridharadas wonders if the support for Bernie Sanders will endure beyond the results of the presidential election. Sanders took the day off Wednesday to 201c in the weeks ahead, 201d according to a top aide. His appearance at a rally in Scranton, Pennsylvania Thursday morning offered the first glimpse into what he had decided. While most of speech remained intact, Sanders dropped the most aggressive portions, which mocked Clinton for her lucrative paid speeches to large banks like Goldman Sachs. He didn 2019t go after her super PACs, nor contributions to her campaign from wealthy donors. Sanders mentioned Clinton only a handful of times, in each to point out differences between their policy records. He drew contrasts with her record on the minimum wage, Social Security, fracking, trade, and the Iraq War, but didn 2019t dwell on them. But any sighs of relief from anxious Democrats were quickly proven premature. RELATED: Team Sanders 2019 delegate strategy, under the microscope Just a few hours later, at a rally in Reading, Pennsylvania, rhetoric on Clinton 2019s transcripts and super PACs were back. 201cWhen I talk about difference between Secretary Clinton and myself, one of the major differences is precisely how we raise money for our campaigns, 201d Sanders said. He noted Clinton has 201cseveral super PACs 201d that take money from Wall Street, and suggested that she herself 201crepresent[s] Wall Street 201d and 201cthe billionaire class. 201d 201cIn addition to that, as you know, Secretary Clinton has given speeches on Wall Street for $225,000 a speech. Not a bad day 2019s work, 201d he said, winding the crowd up for what has reliably become one of his best applause lines. Sanders noted that Clinton has said she would release transcripts of those speeches if 201cother people will do the same. 201d So he said he was going to release the transcripts of his own speeches to Wall Street right then and there. 201cHere you are 2013 you got it? 201d he said as he waved his empty hands and the audience cheered. He even added a new shot at Clinton on her support for a proposed tax on soda. 201cFrankly, I am very surprised that Secretary Clinton would support this regressive tax after pledging not to raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000. This proposal clearly violates her pledge, 201d he said. 201dA tax on soda and juice drinks would disproportionately increase taxes on low-income families in Philadelphia. 201d Asked why the transcript portion of his speech did not appear in the morning, only to return in the afternoon, Sanders spokesperson Michael Briggs replied, 201cno reason. 201d  ",

   "input": "Bathurst murder victim Reginald Mullaly. The sister of a homeless NSW man found stabbed to death under a bridge has made an emotional plea for help to find her brother's killer. The body of Reginald Mullaly,69, was discovered in a makeshift shelter on the Great Western Highway at Bathurst in the state's west in September 2015. Police have been unable to track down his killer. His sister Dawn Brodie on Wednesday appealed for anyone with information to come forward. You are not dobbing in a mate , you are helping me find out what happened to my brother, she said. I miss him every day and I talk to him every day. Police say two of Mr Mullaly's acquaintances were the first to find his body. They've urged anonymous callers who tipped off police through Crimestoppers in September and October to again make contact with detectives. The information we received from these people have helped the investigation greatly , and we simply need to talk to them again, detective chief inspector Colin Cracknell said. A post-mortem revealed Mr Mullaly died from a stab wound to his chest and that he suffered several unexplained injuries. He had $30 ,000 in his bank account before being murdered, something police believe may have been a factor in his death.  ",

   "input": "By Radhika Sanghani, Thursday 3 September 2015 According to the transgender actress and campaigner Laverne Cox, who was nominated for an Emmy for her role in the Netflix series Orange is the New Black, 00e2 0080 009cMost men who are attracted to and date transgender women are probably stigmatised more than trans women are. 00e2 0080 009d The UK 00e2 0080 0099s first ever trans-themed sitcom, the BBC 00e2 0080 0099s Boy Meets Girl, explores precisely these issues. The show tells the story of a trans woman starting a relationship with a younger man and how their community deals with their unusual romance. We spoke to three couples to find out how challenging it is for trans people and their partners to come out. These are their stories. Civil servant Jacqui Gavin,47, and consultant Stephen Gavin,60, have been together for 23 years 00e2 0080 009cMy first wife died of multiple sclerosis back in 1992, 00e2 0080 009d says Stephen. 00e2 0080 009cA few months later, some friends invited me to a party and I saw this stunning woman. I couldn 00e2 0080 0099t understand why she was so quiet and shy given the way she looked. We started chatting and got on very well. 00e2 0080 009cAt that point I didn 00e2 0080 0099t know Jacqui was trans. I didn 00e2 0080 0099t call her until a few months later, because I was still grieving, and we had our first date. That 00e2 0080 0099s when she told me about her past. She was very upfront. I was fortunate because I 00e2 0080 0099d already met Jacqui the woman. 00e2 0080 009d The fact that Stephen had met Jacqui post-transition without any knowledge of her past meant he had already started to fall for her. 00e2 0080 009cI suppose I did have a preconception of what trans people would be like, and would look like, 00e2 0080 009d he says. 00e2 0080 009cBut she didn 00e2 0080 0099t fit into any of that. 00e2 0080 009d 00e2 0080 009cOf course you worry what people think. But you realise people who are worth a damn, don 00e2 0080 0099t give a damn 00e2 0080 009d Jacqui transitioned in 1983, aged 15, after moving out of her family home in Scotland. 00e2 0080 009cI left because of difficulties being bullied at school. I was living in London waiting on tables. I remember putting on make-up and just feeling like me. 00e2 0080 009cBut then, at 16, I had to return home because my mum was ill. I had to 00e2 0080 0098detransition 00e2 0080 0099 which was hard. I joined the RAF. One day they found a bra and knickers in my bag. I could have said they were a girlfriend 00e2 0080 0099s but I didn 00e2 0080 0099t want to lie. 00e2 0080 009cI was called in for a meeting with my supervisors who were furious. They were going to demote me - but I decided to just leave instead. 00e2 0080 009d Jacqui began gender reassignment surgery and, aged 20, started modelling. She had a successful career but after a tabloid 00e2 0080 0098outed 00e2 0080 0099 her a year later (her clients hadn 00e2 0080 0099t known she was trans), she says, 00e2 0080 009cI was dropped like a stone because I wasn 00e2 0080 0099t seen as a woman anymore. 00e2 0080 009d A few years later, she met Steve. And in 1995, the couple wed. 00e2 0080 009cIt was tough to find somewhere to get married, 00e2 0080 009d says Jacqui. 00e2 0080 009cThe Gender Recognition Act didn 00e2 0080 0099t come in until 2004 so we couldn 00e2 0080 0099t do it in the UK. We ended up going to the Caribbean. 00e2 0080 009d Steve says he didn 00e2 0080 0099t experience much stigma 00e2 0080 0093 to his surprise, even his traditional Catholic father accepted Jacqui 00e2 0080 0099s past immediately. By this point he 00e2 0080 0099d already known her for two years and said, 00e2 0080 009cAs far as I 00e2 0080 0099m concerned, Jacqui is and always will be the most beautiful daughter-in-law. 00e2 0080 009d But, in 1995, newspapers got hold of their wedding photos and connected them to Jacqui 00e2 0080 0099s modelling career. 00e2 0080 009cIt was everywhere, 00e2 0080 009d says Steve. 00e2 0080 009cAll over the media. Back then it was probably still seen as, 00e2 0080 0098Are you gay? 00e2 0080 0099 People think you 00e2 0080 0099re going out with a bloke. 00e2 0080 009cOf course you worry about what people think. But then you find out that people who are worth a damn, don 00e2 0080 0099t give a damn. 00e2 0080 009d Filmmaker Lewis Hancox, 26 and illustrator Sophie Moore,33, met three and a half years ago 00e2 0080 009cI was only about four or five when I started saying to my mum I was a boy, 00e2 0080 009d says Lewis, who transitioned from female to male at 18. 00e2 0080 009cWe didn 00e2 0080 0099t even know what being transgender was back then, especially in the small town where I lived up North. 00e2 0080 009cI have always fancied girls, and before transitioning I was labelled gay. But I never liked to refer to myself as gay. I went along with it, but it never felt right. When I realised I was trans it all made sense. Since then I 00e2 0080 0099ve only ever identified as a straight guy. 00e2 0080 009d Lewis first told his story back in 2012, on the Channel 4 documentary My Transsexual Summer. It's how he met his girlfriend of three and a half years, Sophie. 00e2 0080 009cI didn 00e2 0080 0099t know much about being transgender, 00e2 0080 009d says Sophie. 00e2 0080 009cI 00e2 0080 0099d never been aware really that it could go the other way - that a female could transition to a male. So when I saw the trailer for the show I was really interested. 00e2 0080 009cWhen I watched it, I wondered how would I feel if I met a trans guy. Would I date someone like that? I was looking at Lewis - who to me looked like any other man - and thought, 00e2 0080 0098Why not? 00e2 0080 0099 I was actually quite enamoured by him so I added him on Facebook. There was no intention or anything, but we ended up talking every single day for two months. 00e2 0080 009d The couple then met up in London and for Lewis, 00e2 0080 009cThat was it. 00e2 0080 009d He knew he wanted to be with her. For Sophie it took a little bit longer. 00e2 0080 009cPeople tend to assume I 00e2 0080 0099m gay because I 00e2 0080 0099m a bit of a tomboy. But I have always only ever been into guys and I have never been with a trans guy before. I remember saying to Lewis, 00e2 0080 0098It might take me some getting used to 00e2 0080 0099. My only concern was the sexual side of things. 00e2 0080 009d Lewis explains, 00e2 0080 009cThings do change down below and grow to become more male with the testosterone. I also had surgery to neaten and rewire the area. 00e2 0080 009cNow it 00e2 0080 0099s not necessarily big enough for penetrative sex but there are lots of other things in the bedroom I can do. It looks natural to me, and we don 00e2 0080 0099t see it like I was ever a woman. 00e2 0080 009d 00e2 0080 009cI'd never been with a trans guy before. My only concern was the sexual side of things 00e2 0080 009d Sophie adds, 00e2 0080 009cFor me it ended up being a case of nothing mattered because of how I felt about him emotionally. 00e2 0080 009d The couple had support from their friends and family. 00e2 0080 009cMy mum had questions but she was mainly just curious, 00e2 0080 009d explains Sophie. 00e2 0080 009cMy family don 00e2 0080 0099t have an issue with it and I 00e2 0080 0099ve never had any negative remarks. 00e2 0080 009d But, says Lewis, 00e2 0080 009cGay guys come up to me in clubs in Brighton, where everyone knows me, and they say, 00e2 0080 0098I find you attractive. Does that mean I 00e2 0080 0099m straight? 00e2 0080 0099 They say it as though it 00e2 0080 0099s a massive compliment that they might fancy me, but it feels like an insult. 00e2 0080 009d Sophie agrees. 00e2 0080 009cIt pisses me off. It 00e2 0080 0099s incredibly offensive. I've also had straight people applauding me for going out with Lewis. They mean well and I know it 00e2 0080 0099s a positive thing they 00e2 0080 0099re trying to say but it can come across as really insulting. 00e2 0080 009d Freelance artist Sophie Green,40, and marketing professional, Thom Shannon,33, have been a couple for 11 years 00e2 0080 009cThe first time I met Sophie she was a woman. Then, the next morning when I saw her with her friends, she 00e2 0080 0099d gone back to being a man, 00e2 0080 009d says Thom. 00e2 0080 009cBut I quite liked her either way. I asked a mutual friend about her and they said she was engaged to a woman, so I thought that was it. But a few months later it all changed. 00e2 0080 009d 00e2 0080 009cI was in a relationship, which was kind of going South when we first met, and it broke down, 00e2 0080 009d explains Sophie. 00e2 0080 009cI was at the beginning of my transition and I didn 00e2 0080 0099t know who I was. It 00e2 0080 0099s partly why we broke up. 00e2 0080 009cThom and I became friends and stayed that way for a couple of years but, as I got more together, I started to see how good he was for me. I gave him a chance and we hit it off. Thom supported me through the whole transition. We kind of worked it out together really. 00e2 0080 009d 00e2 0080 009cMy parents were confused 00e2 0080 0093 the first time they met Sophie she was a boy 00e2 0080 009d Thom was 21 at that point and had previously identified as gay. 00e2 0080 009cI was still figuring out what I wanted. Now I refuse to identify as anything. 00e2 0080 009d He currently considers himself to be in a heterosexual relationship. 00e2 0080 009cI 00e2 0080 0099m pretty relaxed about my sexuality and, because I knew Sophie as her old identity, I knew everything from the start so her transition was never an issue for me. 00e2 0080 009cMy parents were confused though 00e2 0080 0093 the first time they met Sophie she was living as a boy and they were worried about explaining her transition to the family. But they get on well now, and we haven 00e2 0080 0099t really had any negativity - apart from a few comments on the street. 00e2 0080 009cI think the only problem has been that because I 00e2 0080 0099d been out as gay before, people who'd known her before she transitioned assumed something about her gender and sexual identity. They still see me as gay even though I 00e2 0080 0099m in a straight relationship. 00e2 0080 009cI think a lot of guys are worried about being seen as gay if they 00e2 0080 0099re going out with trans women. 00e2 0080 009d Sophie agrees. 00e2 0080 009cThom was attracted to me as an individual 00e2 0080 0093 not as a trans woman. But I certainly think guys who are attracted to trans women get a rough ride. People judge them a lot. 00e2 0080 009d Before her transition, Sophie had always had relationships with women. 00e2 0080 009cThat 00e2 0080 0099s just the way it was. I was trying to conform to a heterosexual male but I was rubbish at it. I 00e2 0080 0099m more open now. I say I 00e2 0080 0099m pansexual. If I wasn 00e2 0080 0099t with Thom I could be with anyone 00e2 0080 0093 their gender wouldn 00e2 0080 0099t matter. 00e2 0080 009cIt 00e2 0080 0099s been amazing sharing my transition with him. It 00e2 0080 0099s a strange thing but it 00e2 0080 0099s also wonderful. It was bizarre the first time we made love after my gender transition surgery. But it was good. Sex is a different way around for me now. It 00e2 0080 0099s kind of fun finding it all out. 00e2 0080 009d 00e2 0080 009cIt 00e2 0080 0099s like being teenagers again, 00e2 0080 009d adds Thom.

   "input": " 201cThe underground Communists 2019 command headquarters was right in our manor, 201d he said she told him. 201cThose words were engraved in my heart. 201d On a misty morning, Mr. Liu walked past cafes, bars and design stores lining the streets of Anren, now a tourist destination known as the township of museums, for the Liu family manors and other cultural sites. A luxury hotel has been built for vacationers and parents visiting their children at the Confucius International School, which promises to prepare pupils for top foreign universities and boasts of being housed in a school that Liu Wencai built in 1942, where tuition fees were waived for poor but talented pupils. Many residents seem to remember Liu Wencai favorably. 201cIf you ask if people here think Liu Wencai was good, that goes without saying, 201d said Dai Rongyao,89, who was selling embroidered handicrafts. Liu Wencai, born in 1887, amassed huge wealth in the 1920s in the Yangtze River port of Yibin, dominating lucrative businesses including the opium and weapons trades under the wing of his younger brother, Liu Wenhui, a Nationalist warlord. In 1933, Liu Wenhui retreated to the Tibetan region of Kham, after losing a battle to a warlord nephew, and Liu Wencai returned to his hometown, Anren, and sponsored road, water and electricity projects as well as the school. In 1942, Liu Wenhui, long at odds with the Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek, met with Zhou Enlai and began clandestinely cooperating with his Communists. In 1946, at the start of the Chinese civil war, Liu Wencai financed a Communist guerrilla force of around 50 people while allowing its command headquarters to be set up in his manor, said Mr. Liu, who said he learned this from a close aide to Liu Wencai who has since died. (A provincial government history says that underground Communists took advantage of Liu Wencai 2019s conflict with a rival to secure weapons from him.) Liu Wencai died in October 1949, the same month that Mao Zedong proclaimed the founding of the People 2019s Republic. In December, his brother Liu Wenhui openly joined forces with the Communists, and the Nationalists retreated from Sichuan to Taiwan. The Liu family, like many wealthy Chinese, considered fleeing to Hong Kong, fearing what might happen under the new Communist government, Mr. Liu said. But Liu Wenhui urged them to stay, insisting the family would be treated well as the party 2019s friend. Instead, the family 2019s property was seized and its members attacked in a series of political campaigns. In 1958, local officials eager to demonstrate their fervor for Maoist class struggle presented Liu Wencai as the prototype of the exploiting landlord. His coffin was dug up, and his remains were scattered. In 1959, the landlord 2019s residence was turned into a museum, featuring a 201cwater dungeon, 201d an underground space half-filled with water. A woman who claimed to be the dungeon 2019s sole survivor described it as filled with human bones. By the early 1960s, Liu Wencai was nationally notorious as the 201cchief representative of the landlord class for 3,000 years. 201d His brother Liu Wenhui, who in 1959 became forestry minister and escaped persecution under Zhou Enlai 2019s protection, was powerless to reverse the propaganda campaign, though he was secretly upset. 201cWhat the hell are they talking about? 201d was his private comment on one newspaper article about Liu Wencai, according to his grandson Liu Shizhao. In 1965, the Sichuan authorities commissioned more than 100 life-size clay sculptures that the museum installed as the Rent Collection Courtyard, which purported to show how Liu Wencai and his lackeys bullied peasants to extract rents. Replicas of the statues were exhibited in Beijing later that year, drawing hundreds of thousands of visitors. In 1966, just before the onset of the Cultural Revolution, a documentary about Liu Wencai was released, and stories of his crimes were subsequently included in textbooks. Denunciations of the landlord and the evil he ostensibly personified surged during the Cultural Revolution. Family members came under attack. A cousin of Mr. Liu who fled to Xinjiang was murdered along with his wife and children, as were many other people in China branded as 201clandlords. 201d The frenzy subsided only in the 1980s, when liberal voices were tolerated to some extent. In 1988, the provincial authorities admitted that the water dungeon was an invention, and it was drained. But these beginnings of a re-evaluation stalled after the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown as the party tightened its grip, Mr. Liu said. In the museum, Mr. Liu pointed out items he said never belonged to his family. A visitor asked, 201cThis is your family? 201d 201cI 2019m Liu Wencai 2019s grandson, 201d Mr. Liu said. 201cCan we take a picture with you? 201d the man shouted excitedly, pointing at his friends. Mr. Liu became the group 2019s tour guide, and the man, a railway official from Guizhou who said he had visited the museum on a school tour in the 1970s, was startled when Mr. Liu said that nearly everything on display was fake. The 1966 film Rent Collection Courtyard (in Chinese). Video by Lagen Ecafaya YouTube Xiao Shu , the pen name of Chen Min, who in 1999 published 201cThe Truth About Liu Wencai, 201d a book that was soon banned, said the party would be reluctant to restore to respectability a villain of its own making. His book was accused of 201cnegating the legitimacy of the new democratic revolution, 201d when the party persecuted landlords and distributed their property to poor peasants, he said. 201cThis is the basis of the regime 2019s legitimacy, so they don 2019t dare face the truth. 201d Wu Hongyuan,60, a retired county propaganda official who served as the museum 2019s director in the 1990s, said the process of restoring the truth could not be rushed. 201cThe museum is too sensitive, and Liu Wencai is too famous, 201d he said. Mr. Wu said he tried to recast the museum to more accurately present Liu Wencai 2019s life, but anytime he altered something, he said, former underground Communists in Anren would protest to the authorities. Li Weijia,98, was one of those protesters. 201cHe never protected party members! 201d insisted Mr. Li, in a hospital ward reserved for senior officials in Chengdu. 201cThat 2019s confusing black and white! 2019 2019 At the end of his trip to Anren, Mr. Liu visited Chen Fahong,86, a former worker in Liu Wencai 2019s manor. 201cWe had rice and meat to eat then. He was kind, 201d Mr. Chen said of Liu Wencai in his modest yard amid onion fields. 201cAfter liberation 201d in 1949, he said, 201cwe had only bran and grass to eat. 201d Mr. Liu said that, looking back, the family regretted having trusted the Communists. He recalled a song sung in his family after Liu Wenhui sided with the Communists, envisioning a paradise under the party 2019s rule. 201cThere is a good place beyond the mountains, 201d it goes. 201cThere, rich and poor are equal. 201d Follow Vanessa Piao on Twitter @VanessaPiao.

   "input": "Despite repeated German attacks, the bridge 2013 and another nearby 2013 was successfully held by the airborne forces until reinforcements arrived. After the mission, Mr Anderson spent five weeks laying mines and helping the infantry, before suffering a shrapnel injury. 201cIt was a mortar or a shell, 201d he said. 201cWe were holding a position and we were hit. The next thing I remember is waking up in the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. It turned out I had been half buried with shrapnel in my leg, and I was pulled out. 201d He had joined the Royal Engineers as an apprentice in 1938 2013 aged just 14 2013 but later became part of the 591 Parachute Squadron. Robert Coupe,88, saw his heaviest fighting during the push on Caen, in the weeks following the landings. Only 18 of his 100-strong infantry unit reached their objective. He had landed on Sword Beach on the morning of D-Day, and despite the enemy fire, said it was a relief to get ashore. 201cWe were all so seasick. I didn 2019t care whether I got shot or not. I just wanted to get off that landing craft and get my feet on the ground. The Navy boys brought us as close to the beach as they could and then we waded to shore with water up to our armpits. 201d Once ashore, and with the beachheads secured, Mr Coupe and his unit were given orders to march on German-occupied Caen as part of Operation Charnwood. 201cCaen was the key to Normandy. If the Germans broke through at Caen they would have been on the beaches in no time. And they knew that if we punched through them at Caen that would be their lot in France. Robert Coupe, right, during wartime (Dominic Holden) On the evening of July 7th the combined divisions secured positions for a three pincer attack on the city with the 3rd Canadian Division attacking from the right, and British 3rd Division from the left. Mr Coupe 2019s division, the 59th, would be in the centre. As part of the prelude to the assault, a major Allied air attack on the city was launched. 201cI heard the sound of aircraft engines, and 500 Lancaster Bombers flew overhead, dropping 2,600 tons of bombs on Caen, 201d he recalled. 201cThe sight of them flying into that wall of flak to deliver their loads made the soldiers realise what brave comrades they had working with them. It boosted our morale no end, and from then on any jibes about 2018Brylcreem Boys 2019 were definitely out. 201d As the bombers departed for home, the guns of the offshore fleet opened up, joining the barrage of of 21 regiments of Allied artillery, ranged on German batteries and fortified approaches to Caen. 201cThe barrage thundered steadily on through the night and around 0500 hours we began to advance through cornfields and orchards towards Caen. The fields were mined, Mr Coupe said. The Germans were ready for us as they knew we had to come by this route. As we crossed into no-man 2019s-land the hidden German guns opened up with ferocity. In the waist high cornfield when a soldier fell wounded he disappeared from view and many lads bled to death because medics couldn 2019t find them. Casualties were heavy , and we on the frontal assault felt we were battling at impregnable forces. 201d Despite the losses, by the early hours of the following day, Mr Coupe 2019s unit had entered the city 2019s northern suburbs. 201cOne hundred of us set off but only eighteen of us arrived, 201d he said. 201cOur main adversaries in the battle were the 1st and 12th Panzer Divisions and elements of the 21st Panzer Grenadiers. These so called elite troops played every dirty trick in the book, and they knew plenty from their Russian front experiences, fanatical in the extreme and happy to die for Adolf Hitler. They got their death wish in the ruins of Caen. 201d He continued: 201cOne SS soldier who was lying seriously wounded in a field hospital was told that he needed a blood transfusion. He asked the doctor 2018is that English blood? If it is I don 2019t want it 2019 and when the doctor said 2018yes it is and if you don't have it you will die 2019, the German replied. 2018Well, I 2019ll die for the Fuhrer 2019. 201d Mr Coupe, who frequently travels to RAF Brize Norton to attend regular repatriations for soldiers killed in Afghanistan, was wounded later, as the Allied forces engaged in a pincer movement to close the so-called Falaise Gap, and trap the retreating German forces. He was hit by a bullet which slammed into his helmet knocking him unconscious for three days. He woke up in a Bayeux hospital. Mr Coupe, from Blackpool, was called up shortly after his 18th birthday and underwent basic training before being posted to the 5th Battalion, East Lancashire Regiment, part of 197 Brigade of the 59th Infantry Division being prepared for the invasion of Europe. John Salmon,90, from Liverpool, was a member of the Pioneer Corps who, he said, had 201cthe worst job of all 201d 2013 to clear the landing areas of obstructions, explosives and defences so that troops and armour could quickly get off the beaches. He said the most unpleasant task of all was to clean out the wreckage of tanks which had been hit and burnt out. By coincidence, a few days after the landings, Mr Salmon met his brother, who was working for a bakery unit, on the beaches. As a result of this stroke of luck, he was able to provide his platoon with a generous supply of freshly-baked bread. At 95, Lawrence Taylor is one of the oldest Normandy veterans to travel to France. As an RAF Halifax pilot, he flew on bombing raids on Caen to assist the advancing Allied ground forces. Mr Taylor, from Huyton, Merseyside, said: 201cI 2019ve always carried a burden of guilt about the bombing of civilians. Despite directing attacks against military targets, we all knew that civilians would be caught in the destruction. This was especially true of Caen. 201d In 2011, on a visit to Normandy, he was introduced to a French woman who told him that she had lost both her grandparents in the bombing of the city. She told him that she and her family understood and accepted the inevitability of civilian casualties. He later said: 201cIt was the first time since the war I felt unburdened. 201d Stanley Cox, a tank gunner, landed on Gold beach at dawn, in one of the first tanks ashore. Stan is the veteran in the wheelchair left of the Queen By nightfall, he and his unit had reached the outskirts of Bayeux, about four miles from the coast. He said he and his comrades spent 201can anxious 201d night waiting for the 8th Armoured Brigade to catch up. At 4am the following morning, his tank, commanded by Lt Mike Howden, was sent into Bayeux on a reconnaissance mission, making him one of the first liberators of a major French town. He said his unit was heavily involved in the fighting in the days after D-Day and it was during a clash at a location known as Hill 103, near Tilly sur Seulles, around eight miles south east of Bayeux, that his tank was hit. He was severely wounded in the left arm, right buttock and right leg and was evacuated to Gateshead, where he spent nine months in hospital. He has previously visited Normandy, but missed one recent trip after he broke his hip weeks before he was due to leave. Hospital staff were surprised to discover that much of the shrapnel from his wound is still in his body. Mr Cox joined the army in 1943 and completed his basic training in Yorkshire with the infantry but was quickly transferred to the Royal Armoured Corps to train as a gunner on the Centaur tank. The RAC started to receive large numbers of the much more durable American Sherman tank and Mr Cox was switched to this vehicle. In December 1943, he joined to Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry, A Squadron, to start training for the invasion. Douglas David Render recalls that he was surprised to find himself in Normandy after he was sent to Portsmouth in June 1944 to oversee the loading of tanks onto a landing craft, which sailed while he was on board. Capt David Render at the Charles de Percy CWGC visiting two SRY graves 201cI was ordered to Portsmouth in June 201844 but had no idea why. I was told to oversee the loading of 16 Cromwell tanks on a landing craft. I could see that Pompey was awash with frantic loading of equipment, men, food and so on onto ships but just did as ordered. The next thing I knew the ship was at sea. 201d The landing craft arrived just off Gold beach at early light and the front loading platform was lowered. The first tank drove off but disappeared from sight, sinking with the loss of all crew. It had vanished into an underwater trench. The ship 2019s commander then moved the craft to another location on the beach and all the other craft were safely disembarked. Mr Render,88, was ordered to join the Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry and went into battle as troop leader seven days after D-Day. Their opponents included the SS Hermann Goring division, who he described as 201cnasty pieces of work, these b-----s set fire to a church with all the villagers in. How can anyone do that? 201d He recalls entering a small church in Normandy and found it filled with flowers, crosses and candles that the Germans had left behind. 201cI thought it strange that we and them were praying to the same God for victory and safety. 201d Mr Render had two tanks blown from under him but remained a troop leader until the end of the war, a rare achievement given that the Sherwoods lost 59 officers from June 1944 to the end of the war. He had volunteered to join the army on his 18th birthday in 1942 and was sent to the Royal Armoured Corps training centre at Bovington, Dorset, where as a trooper he spent six months on tank training. He said he got fed up of standing sentry duty at the camp gates so applied to become an officer. Graham Stevenson almost missed the fighting in Normandy after he was punished for answering back to a corporal. Graham Stevenson, right, with Stan Cox When he finally rejoined his regiment, 14 days after D Day, he was wounded on his first day in action and repatriated back to Britain. He had served in a tank squadron for the Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry in North Africa having joined up under age. It meant that when he returned to England, despite being only 19, he was vastly more experienced that many other servicemen, including a new corporal who he told to 201cget stuffed, or words to that effect 201d, he recalled. 201cIt was Sunday morning and I had a hangover and I wasn 2019t in the mood for some new boys to give me a hard time. 201d The incident earned Mr Stevenson, born in Walsall in 1925, seven days in the guardhouse. As he was being marched off, General Bernard Montgomery drove past him into the camp 2013 to instruct senior officers on the Normandy operation. By the time Mr Stevenson had served his punishment, the regiment had moved off for D-Day training. He had a few jobs until finally rejoining his unit a fortnight after the landings. He was wounded on his first day of action when his tank was hit and he was machine gunned in the arm. He spent the next six months in a hospital in Wolverhampton. Aubrey Sales,89, from Nottingham, was on board a salvage vessel, the Southampton Salvour, which assisted with the landings. A gunner in the Defence Equipped Merchant Service (D.E.M.S.), he had joined the ship shortly before D-Day when it was lying in Southampton Water. Two days before the invasion, the vessel moved downstream and anchored near some landing craft which already had army personnel on board. The crew also noticed a lot of American troops on shore preparing to board vessels. 201cAll the troop ships were in Southampton, all the Americans, we were all just lying in the Solent until we got the order and we were off. It was a quiet, silent move down the Solent and across the water, 201d he said. The Southampton Salvour sailed on June 5th in the early evening, with Mr Sales unaware of where they were heading. They were then joined by escort ships and the captain revealed that they were making for the Normandy beaches, where a landing was to take place. Aubrey, in naval uniform, with his brother Eric The vessel arrived at Arromanches, where divers onboard helped to secure the floating 201cMulberry harbours 201d to the seabed. The crew then had to help LCTs (Landing Craft Tanks) to beach. 201cOur job was five miles out, when the LCTs came, we had to beach them. The LCTs weren 2019t given enough petrol, you see, that 2019s one reason they had to postpone the first D Day, because the waves took the speed from the LCTs and they used more petrol. 201cThey only did three to four knots; my ship did 12 knots. We towed them in and up onto the beach with tanks on and men. Back then I didn 2019t know the beach names. 201d Mr Sales recalled that some soldiers would not drive their tanks or lorries over the dead soldiers lying on the beach. 201cWe did our job that day and we moved on. In those days you just got on with it, 201d he said. The veterans have travelled to Normandy on trips supported by the Big Lottery Fund 2019s Heroes Return scheme. The charity scheme allows Second World War servicemen to make commemorative visits to the places where they fought and served.  ",

Called The Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer, or LADEE, the moon-orbiting craft will measure the thin lunar atmosphere. Scientists want to learn the composition of the moon's ever-so-delicate atmosphere and how it might change over time and whether dust actually levitates from the lunar surface. Unlike the quick three-day Apollo flights to the moon, the LADEE will take a full month to get there. 00c2 The six-month mission costs $280m. It will orbit Earth's closest neighbour for a few months, analysing the ever-so-delicate atmosphere and lunar dust. An Air Force Minotaur rocket, built by Orbital Sciences Corp., is providing the ride. This will be the first moonshot from Virginia. All but one of NASA's approximately 40 moon missions, including the manned Apollo flights of the late 1960s and early 1970s, originated from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The most recent were the twin Grail spacecraft launched two years ago. The lone exception, Clementine, a military-NASA venture, rocketed away from Southern California in 1994. The soaring Minotaur rocket should be visible along much of the East Coast as far south as South Carolina, as far north as Maine and as far west as Pittsburgh.

Cars depreciate 11% the minute you drive them off the lot, and lose 19% of their value in the first year. You don 2019t get your money 2019s worth out of a car until you 2019ve driven for a while. 2. You Sale Shop for Things You Don 2019t Need It 2019s Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Super Saturday, or Free Shipping Day, and you 2019re right out there among the rest of them. Fighting your way through the crowds 2014 real or virtual 2014 to get your hands on stuff you never knew you wanted. You hate to miss one of your local department or computer store 2019s special sales (nearly every weekend), and you never pass up two-for-one coupons for things you don 2019t even need one of. 201cBut look how much I 2019m saving! 201d you say. But look how much you 2019re saving if you keep your wallet in your pocket. What 2019s that you say? You only shop at discount stores, dollar stores, and places with Barn, Depot or Warehouse in their names? Look how much I 2019m saving! Yep, you 2019re saving what it would have cost if you 2019d bought the same things at high-end establishments. But if you don 2019t need them, then you 2019re not saving a cent no matter what you paid for them. Plus you 2019ve got to figure out where to put everything when you get it home. You want to wind up living like someone on Hoarders? 3. You Pay Fees to Use a Credit Card or Checking Account You 2019re handing over money to a credit card company so that you can pay interest on the money you owe them? What a deal! There are a few exceptions when the program rewards will more than pay the fee, but generally, paying an annual credit card fee is dumb. There are plenty of credit cards with no annual fee. Get one. The same applies to having accounts at a bank that charges a monthly checking account fee or a fee to visit a teller instead of an ATM. Do some research and find a bank that will accommodate you with no fees for a minimum deposit you can live with. 4. You Don 2019t Use Loyalty Cards at the Stores You Shop at Regularly Rail as you might at the insidiousness of grocery and other stores that extract personal information from you and track your purchases in exchange for giving you discounts, if you regularly shop at a store that offers special pricing to customers in its loyalty program and you don 2019t take advantage of it, you 2019re over-spending at that store by 20% or more every time you shop there. Unless you 2019re in a witness protection program, it 2019s absolutely worth the savings to give your local supermarket your address and phone number and let them keep tabs on the brand of butter you buy. 5. You Eat Out More Often Than You Eat at Home If your breakfast comes in a Styrofoam container, your lunch is delivered in a plastic box, and you 2019re choosing dinner from a menu, you 2019re spending way more than you have to. You can 2019t help it if you 2019re on the road, but otherwise, you can eat as well or better at home for a lot less money, even if you barely cook at all. Tax and tip alone add about 25% to the price you 2019d pay if you bought the food yourself and just nuked it. If you actually know how to cook, there 2019s sort of no excuse.

Putnam Investments chief executive Robert Reynolds, a loyal GOP backer, said he is 201cfocused on the House and Senate campaigns. 201d And private equity veteran Scott Sperling, a major Hillary Clinton fund-raiser in 2008 and Mitt Romney supporter in 2012, has not yet embraced a candidate. 201cI just don 2019t see myself being there at this point for either candidate, 2019 2019 said Sperling, co-president of Thomas H. Lee Partners in Boston. For many Republican-leaning business executives in Massachusetts, known in the past for vocal political positions and deep pockets, this is a tortured election season that has them sitting on the sidelines. 201cI don 2019t worry about Donald Trump launching a nuclear missile or wreaking havoc for Wall Street, 2019 2019 Sperling said. But he does worry about the Republican nominee 2019s off-the-cuff remarks. Doug Clifford, left, argued with Darrell Crate, chairman of the Massachusetts Republican Party, right, on the steps of the State House in 2004. 201cIt 2019s not my style, and I think it 2019s one of the things that makes him someone that lots of people can 2019t support, 201d said Sperling, who is no fan of the Obama administration 2019s financial regulations, which he believes Clinton will continue. It 2019s a microcosm of the dilemma Republicans around the country have faced: deciding what to do about Trump. Nationally, Republican figures including former Treasury secretary Henry Paulson and Hewlett-Packard executive Meg Whitman have shifted their support to Clinton in the wake of some of Trump 2019s controversies. Boston 2019s largest hedge fund manager, Seth Klarman, who ordinarily supports GOP candidates, also has defected to Clinton. But for many in this state 2019s financial sector 2014 who rallied around Romney in the last cycle 2014 there is no appealing choice this year. Healey, who served as lieutenant governor under Romney and is now president of Babson College in Wellesley, said in an interview that she is leaning toward the Libertarian ticket, which includes former Massachusetts governor William Weld. 201cAs a lifelong Republican who has deeply conservative values concerning the economy and foreign policy, it is a painful and difficult decision not to support our candidate, 2019 2019 she said. 201cBut I cannot vote for Donald Trump. 201d Her reasons: 201cTrump 2019s arrogant and offensive verbal assaults on veterans and their families, the disabled, women, Hispanics, immigrants, and anyone who dares to question his opinions, 201d she said, 201creveal a deeply flawed personal character. 201d She added: 201cHis ignorance of our Constitution is unforgivable in a candidate for president. 201d As to whether casting a ballot for Weld is a throw-away vote, Healey said, 201cIt 2019s the only scenario that seems to offer an alternative to those of us who feel caught in the middle. 201d Scott Sperling, Betsy Nabel, and John Fish attended the Brigham and Women's Palm Beach dinner in this file photo. Others, though, are just avoiding the topic of politics in a particularly divisive year. Privately, a number of Republicans and Democrats in Boston financial circles are predicting that more people will move toward Clinton, casting a ballot, if not writing a check. Abigail Johnson, chief executive of Fidelity Investments, supported Jeb Bush last fall, but it 2019s not yet known whom she 2019ll support next. Construction magnate John Fish wrote checks to New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida before the primary. He was unavailable for comment this week. Better evidence of where the city 2019sexecutives stand should come later this month, when the next round of fund-raising reports for presidential campaigns and SuperPACs are due at the Federal Election Commission. Amid the uncertainty, some party stalwarts are standing their ground. Jerry Jordan, a longtime Boston investment executive and GOP donor, was a co-chair of a Trump fund-raiser over the weekend on Cape Cod at the home of billionaire Bill Koch. Darrell Crate, an investment executive who formerly oversaw the Massachusetts Republican Party and served as a Romney campaign official, said he is supporting Trump. 201cFundamentally, I 2019m in the camp of, disruption in government is good. We do need a new path, 2019 2019 Crate said in an interview. 201cIt 2019s very clear that Donald Trump is laying out a different path. 201d  ",

   "input": "Writer Tory Newmyer (@torynewmyer) is filling in for Geoff Colvin this week. Donald Trump on Monday attempted to reset his struggling campaign with a speech outlining his economic agenda. He described a plan that stitches together mostly traditional, supply-side prescriptions 2014 cutting the top individual tax rate to 33 percent and the corporate rate to 15 percent, ending the estate tax, and imposing a moratorium on new regulation 2014 with his protectionist approach to trade that 2019s had business howling. The address has received mixed reviews. But at least for the Trump campaign, for a moment, the focus was on substance, rather than the candidate 2019s latest conspiracy theory or salvo in one of his ongoing feuds. If the Trump campaign 2019s hope was to stanch the bleeding from the rolling disaster that was last week, the early returns are not particularly encouraging. The newly buttoned-down, on-message Trump survived until 6:45pm, when he suggested via a tweet that Hillary Clinton 2019s 201chacked emails 201d were responsible for the execution of an Iranian nuclear scientist, citing as evidence that 201cmany people 201d have said so. Meanwhile, high-profile Republican defections continued to mount. Fifty top Republican national security figures released a letter declaring Trump 201cwould be the most reckless president in American history 201d and endanger 201cour country 2019s national security and well-being. 201d And Maine Sen. Susan Collins, a moderate Republican from a state where Trump hopes to pick up an electoral vote, published an op-ed announcing she won 2019t support him. Collins pointed in part to the candidate 2019s post-primary failure to 201cfocus on jobs and the economy, tone down his rhetoric, develop more thoughtful policies and, yes, apologize for ill-tempered rants. 201d Trump so far has ignored the Collins snub. But his campaign released a statement responding to the national security officials 2019 letter, donning it as a badge of honor. 201cThe names on this letter are the ones the American people should look to for answers on why the world is a mess, and we thank them for coming forward so everyone in this country knows who deserves the blame for making the world such a dangerous place, 201d his statement read. 201cThey are nothing more than the failed Washington elite looking to hold onto their power, and it 2019s time they are held accountable for their actions. 201d The response feels like a relevant footnote to yesterday 2019s post in this space. It looked at the New York Times investigation into think tanks courting corporate sponsors and the risk the practice poses for an arguably imperiled expert class. Trump knows he owes his success so far in part to a popular rejection of the Washington establishment. The officials who signed the Monday letter draw their credibility from decades of service at the top levels of government. Trump, who 2019s never served, hews to a different standard, as he makes clear when he cites the speculation of 201cmany people 201d as evidence his Democratic opponent 2019s emails got a scientist killed. Monday 2019s economic address notwithstanding, that is the candidate he 2019s been and will continue to be, though his appeal to GOP primary voters doesn 2019t appear to be translating to a general-election audience.

   "input": "Showtime's Homeland starts filming its sixth season next week in New York. Despite the fact that they have yet to shoot a single frame, stars Claire Danes and Mandy Patinkin and showrunner co-creator Alex Gansa had a lot to talk about when meeting with reporters on Thursday afternoon at the Television Critics Association's summer press tour. As casting and teased log lines have implied, the sixth season will focus on the election 2014 or rather, its immediate aftermath. It takes place between Election Day and the presidential inauguration. But just because the drama, which tries to keep pace with current events, has cast a woman (Elizabeth Marvel) to play the president elect does not mean that they're sure Hillary Clinton will win in November. Every season , when we're developing stories, we're terrified of being counterfactual by the time we air, said Gansa. This year , we're hedging our bets a little bit. She's a little bit Hillary, a little bit Donald Trump and a little bit Bernie Sanders. He continued: If you listen to Donald Trump , there are these people who run the government from administration to administration and they have completely screwed the world up. There is part of that in our president. There is also a little bit of Hillary, in terms of she's a pragmatist and knows Washington from the inside. 'Homeland' Casts Female President for Season 6 Touching on Trump specifically , Gansa noted that one of the many people they've consulted about is general and former NSA head Michael Hayden. Hayden has been outspoken about the potential dangers of a Trump presidency. I think it's fair to say there's some concern , Gansa offered. When asked why they chose New York over Washington , D.C., Gansa pointed to it being Danes' primary residence. They both also offered up that it naturally plays into a national security narrative. The most life-altering , country-changing event in the world happened in New York on Sept. 11, offered Gansa. We are still dealing with the reaction to that as a country. Someone might argue there was an overreaction in the aftermath. ... Those are the things we're dealing with this season. The president elect , a junior New York Senator, will be conducting the transition out of her home state. The biggest question in the aftermath of Homeland's fifth season was the fate of Rupert Friend's character. And, despite Quinn seemingly dying in the last scenes, Friend is still listed as a series regular. 'Homeland' Near Renewal for Seasons 7 and 8, Won't Return Until 2017 Quinn is alive , said Gansa of the character. I can say that much , but we really want to be careful about revealing what his condition is. He suffered a major stroke last season. You are going to see a very changed and altered Quinn this year. I think Quinn, this coming season, will really represent a profound and familiar casualty of the war on terror for our audience. What he endured last year is different from what he'll go through this year. This year will be suffused with his daily relationship with Claire's character. Danes did not talk much about about her character's emotional storylines , but she did touch on her relationship with Patinkin's Saul. I think that they have diverged , she said. There has been a split that they've been working on repairing over the course of the last couple of seasons 2014 to varying degrees of success. Saul has committed himself even more to the agency , and Carrie rejects some fundamental principals of it. They are still profoundly bonded. As Showtime boss David Nevins announced in June , Homeland will get a seventh and eighth season. It could still go on after that 2014 but when asked if he had an idea about an endgame, Gansa offered a shrug. I wish , he said. We really don't. David Nevins says we take the show season by season. We take it episode by episode. Pie in the sky , we would all like to take the show back to Israel for the final season. It would be great to end the run there, but it's a big question if we could ever go back.  ",

Save Beeliar Wetlands raised $50,000 in one month to pay for its High Court challenge to the WA government's environmental approval for the Roe 8 highway extension, which is the most contentious part of the $1.9 billion project. The protest group expects to find out in about five weeks whether it has been granted leave to appeal in the High Court, and if proceedings progress to a full hearing, the City of Cockburn has promised to contribute a further $25,000. The group was outraged last week when the state government signed a $450 million construction contract for Roe 8. The Labor opposition reiterated it would axe the project if it won power at the March state election, but stopped short of pledging to tear up the contracts, saying it needed to see the documents and explore its legal options first. Premier Colin Barnett was dismissive of the High Court bid, saying even if it goes ahead, it is very unlikely to succeed because there is no dispute about environmental standards. Convenor Kate Kelly said the group would mount a very strong campaign , legal and otherwise. We believe we can stop Roe 8 through legal action , however we may need to respond quickly to any physical threat to the wetlands, particularly if injunctive proceedings are required, she said. If we win this court case , the environmental approvals will be swept away. What are they doing signing contracts when they know that the potential is those contracts will not be able to be honoured? Mr Barnett says the joint state and federal funded project will provide a direct route for trucks to Fremantle port - reducing congestion , improving road safety and freight efficiency. He says it is supported by the transport industry as well as most southern suburbs residents who want fewer trucks on busy Leach Highway.  ",

But seven out of 10 think the UK should be able to limit the number of EU citizens coming to live and work in the country - something leading European politicians say is not compatible with the single market membership required to permit untrammelled free trade. Forced to choose between the two priorities, voters questioned by NatCen Social Research opted by the narrowest of margins for immigration controls, with 49 per cent thinking freedom of movement for EU citizens should be kept if it enables the UK to keep free trade, and 51 per cent opposing it. NatCen senior research fellow Professor John Curtice said the findings suggested voters are not attracted by either the hard Brexit or soft Brexit scenarios which are often presented as the only options in Britain's withdrawal negotiations. Prime Minister Theresa May has always insisted that the choice between hard or soft Brexit is a false one , and that she will seek a bespoke arrangement tailor-made for the UK. The NatCen poll found that 94 per cent of Remain voters and 90 per cent of Leave voters agreed that companies based in the EU should be allowed to sell goods and services freely in Britain in return for allowing British companies to sell goods and services freely in the EU - a wording intended to describe continued membership of the single market. Other soft Brexit arrangements also appealed to people on both sides in the referendum debate with some 86 per cent - including 68 per cent of Leave voters - saying all EU citizens in the UK should be allowed to stay  ",

However, most also think the tax is unfair. English traveller Tom Crich,19, and Juma Ing,18, from Holland say a new tax wouldn't affect their plans to pick fruit and travel the east coast of Australia.

   "input": "There's an episode from the last season of that I kept thinking about this week. Doug Heffernan, played with impeccable comic timing by Kevin James, is a character who loves his fast food burgers, chips and other assorted junk foods. Well, in this particular episode, he almost hits a chicken on the highway, and then he winds up adopting the bird as a pet. Suddenly the thought of eating chicken or any meat appalls him. So he becomes a vegetarian, and pretty much overnight, as I recall, without all of those burgers and chips coursing through his body, he turns into this intellectual who enjoys crossword puzzles and , and not comic books but actual novels with feeling and depth. But then as you're watching the show, you suddenly realize that Doug's doomed because there are some fast food restaurants concocting these amazingly delicious burgers. Doug succumbs, of course, and goes back to his gluttonous ways. I kept thinking about that episode because here I am, in week 13 of The Money Diet , and I saw two amazing looking burgers at two different fast food outlets , and really, really wanted them, and somehow managed to not order them. But before I go on, if this is your first time reading The Money Diet , here's the scoop: Every Friday , since Jan. 1, I've been writing about my attempt to lose weight. I've been adding up the money I save buying fast food and junk food, and then, of course, fervently hoping that along with expanding my checking account, maybe I'll shrink my waistline. At first, the diet worked beautifully. I lost 11 pounds in the first week. Apparently, my body went into some sort of shock, no longer getting a steady supply of Doritos, pretzels, Pringles, fast food burgers and fries, Coca-Cola and whatever else I was typically consuming. After that, I lost a little more, and had one week where I gained some, and then I lost a bit more, and then had quite a plateau where nothing much was happening. Then last week, but feared it was a fluke. Well, not ordering the two burgers I saw (more on those in a moment), and trying to watch what I'm eating in general, and trying to exercise a little more, has all apparently paid off. At least, this week, it did. I have lost two more pounds. So here's how my weight's looking now. I have to admit, I was pretty excited to lose these two pounds. Several days ago, I found myself at 245 pounds and thought, Boy , if I can just maintain this weight until I write the column... And to my surprise , the morning I wrote the column, I had shed another half pound. It was nice to think, Hey , I'm on a roll, instead of , Hey , I'd like a roll. So about those burgers. Last weekend , I took my daughters to a park, and my wife called on the cell phone and suggested I pick something up to eat. Foolishly, I let my daughters choose where we'd go pick up our food, and my oldest voted for Burger King, and my youngest, McDonald's. So off we went. But at Burger King's drive-through, I found myself longingly staring at their A.1 Steakhouse . I'm not sure how long it's been on the menu, but it was as if we had met for the first time. I couldn't remember seeing anything quite like it. As their Web site says, it's an extra-thick flame-broiled 7 oz. beef patty topped with mayo , crispy onions, A.1 Thick & Hearty Steak Sauce, plus American cheese, lettuce and red-ripe tomatoes. And the photo on the drive-through menu? Well , it was like food porn. Suddenly, I wanted her -- I mean, it -- at all costs. , my little voice urged. my reasoned part of my brain stammered. , my evil little voice pointed out. my evil voice suggested helpfully, I would know. So I ordered for my daughter and drove off to McDonald's and picked up some food for my youngest daughter and my wife. And then days later, when I was looking up the XT burger online, , and what I managed to avoid. I'm not really sure what it's like to have a chill run up your spine, but I think that's what happened when I looked everything over: Wow, maybe if I were 20 years younger, with a faster metabolism, I might try that burger, but clearly, the XT is out of my league. And then everything was going fine for several days, and I forgot about cheating on my diet, until the evening before writing all of this, I stopped at a Wendy's with my two daughters, after another visit at a park and a rousing game of tag. I bought my youngest a kid's size Frosty and found myself staring at the drive-through menu. Wendy's has something fairly new, called the Bacon & Blue Hamburger. Once again, I was in love... and considered ordering it on the spot, since, well, I had surely lost of a lot of calories in that game of tag. This burger is slathered in blue cheese crumbles , according to its Web site , layered with four strips of thick , fresh-cooked Applewood Smoked Bacon. Not to mention onions , a creamy steakhouse sauce, tomato... The photo on the drive-through menu once again had me wanting to push my diet to the side and start a steamy, sordid affair on the side with this burger. , it's just as well that I didn't get this, too. It's nowhere near what the XT Burger is, but still... So, yeah, I'm glad I didn't fall for temptation, and I definitely saved some money in the process. And, by the way, after picking up that Frosty, I bought my oldest daughter some ice cream at Dairy Queen. Once again, I didn't buy anything. Yeah, it was a long week. So here's my weekly list of what foods I avoided and how much I believe I have saved: There might be more examples I'm forgetting, but those are the significant moments. So, yeah, two pounds this week. It was a good week, and I'm proud that, unlike Doug Heffernan, I didn't succumb to the whims of fast food. Is it pathetic that I'm now bragging that my willpower is stronger than the willpower of a fictional television character? Yeah, probably, but please let me have my moment.  ",

   "input": "Willie Nelson drives a Mercedes. Paul Natkin Farm Aid, via Associated Press Willie Nelson helped promote it in Seattle. The diesel fuel BioWillie is sold in four states. But do not lose faith, true believers. The exhaust from Mr. Nelson's diesel-powered Mercedes smells like peanuts, or French fries, or whatever alternative fuel happens to be in his tank. While Bono tries to change the world by hobnobbing with politicians and Sir Bob Geldof plays host to his mega-benefit concerts, Willie Nelson has birthed his own brand of alternative fuel. It is called, fittingly enough, BioWillie. And in BioWillie, Mr. Nelson,72, has blended two of his biggest concerns: his love of family farmers and disdain for the Iraq war. BioWillie is a type of biodiesel, a fuel that can be made from any number of crops and run in a normal diesel engine. If it sounds like a joke, a number of businesses, as well as city and state and county governments, have been switching their transportation fleets to biodiesel blends over the last year. The rationale is that it is a domestic fuel that can provide profit to farmers and that it will help the environment, though environmentalists are not universally enthusiastic about it. I knew we needed to have something that would keep us from being so dependent on foreign oil , and when I heard about biodiesel, a light come on, and I said, 'Hey, here's the future for the farmers, the future for the environment, the future for the truckers, Mr. Nelson said in an interview this month. It seems like that's good for the whole world if we can start growing our own fuel instead of starting wars over it. In some ways , it is a return to the origins of the diesel engine; some of Rudolf Diesel's first engines ran on peanut oil more than a century ago. Last week, a cargo-loading company that operates in the Port of Seattle said that to fuel its equipment next year it would purchase 800,000 gallons of biodiesel, most of it a blend known as B20 that is 80 percent conventional diesel. As of late September, Minnesota requires almost all diesel fuel sold in the state to be 2 percent biodiesel, and Cincinnati started using a 30 percent biodiesel blend, B30, in its city buses because of concerns about fuel shortages after Hurricane Katrina. Biodiesel can cost as much as a $1 a gallon more than regular diesel when pure, though it is typically sold as B20. Prices vary depending on volume and region, and new tax incentives are aimed at closing the cost gap. BioWillie was selling for $2.37 a gallon yesterday in Carl's Corner, Mr. Nelson's own truck stop in Texas that serves as headquarters of his year-old company, Willie Nelson BioDiesel. That was just 4 cents more than the conventional diesel selling at another station nearby. Mr. Nelson's BioWillie is aimed mostly at truckers and is usually sold as B20 (pure biodiesel can congeal in colder climates). BioWillie is currently sold at 13 gas stations and truck stops in four states (with Texas having the most), and it fuels the buses and trucks for Mr. Nelson's tours. If BioWillie demonstrates anything, it is that the combination of Middle East wars, global warming and rising prices at the pump has led many people to offer solutions to the world's energy's squeeze. Depending on whom you ask, cars will someday run on hydrogen, electricity, natural gas or ethanol. Mr. Nelson is making his bet on biodiesel. I don't like the war , he said in the interview. In fact , I don't know if you ever remember a couple years ago, it was Christmas day, and my son Lukas was born on Christmas Day, he's like 16 years old, and we were watching TV and there was just all kind of hell breaking loose and people getting killed and I was talking to my wife, Annie, and I said, You know, all the mothers crying and the babies dying and she said, 'Well, you ought to go write that.' So I wrote a song called 'Whatever Happened to Peace on Earth?' He began to recite the first verse: So many things going on in the world , Just how much oil is human life worth? And whatever happened to peace on earth? That upset a lot of people , as you can imagine, he continued. I've been upset about this war from the beginning and I've known it's all about oil.  ",

   "input": "Chinedu Echeruo hopes New Yorkers will log onto his Web site rather than rely on the kindness of strangers - when it comes to asking for advice on which subway or bus to take, that is. Mike Falco for The New York Times Chinedu Echeruo's Web site HopStop.com helps travelers navigate mass transit systems. Directions can be sent as text messages to cellphones. In November, Mr. Echeruo started a Web site, HopStop.com, that he says will so simplify the world of mass transit that advertisers, Internet search engines and transit agencies will eventually clamor to use and buy ads on the site. He says the site has processed more than a million requests so far this year and averages about 150,000 users a month. HopStop users type addresses, landmarks or businesses into origin and destination fields. Based on criteria set by the user, the site determines the quickest and most convenient pathway through New York's expansive mass transit system. Users of the free service can print the directions or have them sent as text messages to cellphones. The site's results are based on time of day and whether users prefer walking more or making transfers. Mr. Echeruo says sophisticated algorithms create the directions by taking into account users' preferences, as well as train and bus schedules. Every entrepreneur starts off thinking 'What's a problem I can fix?' said Mr. Echeruo , a native Nigerian who has spent much of the last decade in New York. The problem for me was how to get from Point A to Point B in New York. It is a challenge that Mr. Echeruo ,32, has been working on since 2001. HopStop has expanded into Boston and Washington, though the services in those cities are not yet complete. By the end of the year, HopStop expects to offer a similar service for transit systems in North Jersey and Philadelphia. Eventually, Mr. Echeruo said he hoped to provide information for the 10 biggest United States transit markets. Transit direction services are still in their infancy and there is no central, national repository for local train and bus information, something HopStop aspires to become, just as MapQuest did for online road mapping information. In the New York region, a nonprofit organization created by local transit agencies, Transcom, recently introduced a travel site, Trips123.com. But delays in creating it prompted one local programmer, Edward J. Garrity, to build his own site that is available free to the public, SubwayInfo.com. So far, HopStop's only income comes from banner and text ads inserted by Google. The revenue is not enough to make the site profitable, but Mr. Echeruo says he does not need much to keep the business going. His four programmers work from home, and he works out of a room in his brother's Park Avenue law offices. Mr. Echeruo, a Harvard Business School graduate, worked as an analyst at investment banks and hedge funds before starting HopStop. He declined to disclose HopStop's backers or how much they have invested, but he said the site cost substantially less than the $20 million that Transcom spent on creating Trips123.com , which covers more mass transit systems than HopStop. Mr. Garrity, SubwayInfo.com's creator, says he admires HopStop's clean interface and smart tools, but said he was unsure whether the site could become profitable unless the cost of advertising goes back to the levels it was back in the late 1990's. Mr. Echeruo acknowledges that HopStop cannot earn a profit on advertising alone. His plans call for creating partnerships with Internet mapping and search companies like MapQuest , Google, MSN and Yahoo. HopStop appears to be unique in some of its services, said Gary Stein, a senior analyst at Jupiter Research in San Francisco. Clever ideas have a really great chance to build on this system , he said. James Greiner , director of marketing at MapQuest, said his company wanted to provide transit directions, but accurate and updated data on subway, train and bus schedules were not readily or easily available. We are excited about HopStop because we think that represents the next innovation in the industry , he said. Mr. Greiner said he had met Mr. Echeruo , but MapQuest, which is owned by America Online, has no formal relationship with HopStop. MapQuest, which comScore Media Metrix says is the Internet's most-used mapping service, said it would want any potential partner to have national coverage. Stephen Lawler, general manager of Microsoft's MSN Virtual Earth and MapPoint services, said his company encouraged companies like HopStop to provide their services on top of the Virtual Earth mapping service and software. Our vision is it would be an open system and they can come up and add their layer , he said. Besides end users , Mr. Echeruo is also looking to pitch HopStop's services to transit agencies. Having built a mapping infrastructure for New York subways and buses, which he describes as the most complex transit system in the country , Mr. Echeruo said he believed he could sell the service to smaller cities. A transit authority that has , say, 75 buses in a urban town, they can go through the process of hiring some custom software programmers, he said. But if they worked with us , they can have a trip planning service that is available to their users within two months. It is unclear whether many public agencies will hire the company to create their sites , but officials at the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, which has had a trip-planning tool on its Web site since 1999, said they would be eager to talk to HopStop, especially about providing transit directions to large Internet search engines. Syd Garriss, an electronic communications media manager for the authority, said technology companies and transit agencies had not collaborated as fully as they might. It's truly somewhat of a communications block between the two industries , he said.  ",

The sharp-witted master of a thousand voices, known for his amusingly insincere grin, was the seventh member of the snakebit show's cast to die young. As details continued to emerge last night, police questioned a mystery man who called 911 from inside the $1.4 million Encino estate to alert authorities that something terrible was happening inside, said Detective Craig Harvey of the county coroner's office. The man apparently arrived after Hartman was killed. The comedian was dead when cops arrived just after 6 a.m., and officers were carrying the two children from the house when they heard the self-inflicted shot that killed Brynn Hartman, Harvey said. She shot herself as police were removing the second child from the home , said Lt. Anthony Alba of the Los Angeles Police Department. Mr. Hartman had been dead for a while. The Hartmans were found dead on the bed in the master bedroom , Harvey said. Phil Hartman,49, who mimicked President Clinton and Ed McMahon on SNL and went on to star as a smarmy newsman in the NBC sitcom NewsRadio , was found lying on his side , wearing boxer shorts and a T-shirt. His blond ex-model wife was sprawled on her back in cotton pajamas, Harvey said. There is a clear possibility he was shot more than once , Harvey said. There was no sign of a struggle or that he took any defensive action. Brynn Hartman ,40, was last seen the night before, happily sipping drinks with a friend at an Italian restaurant a block from her home. Two .38-caliber revolvers were seized from the house, but Harvey would not say whether either was used in the shootings. Police arriving at the gated estate found 9-year-old Sean and 6-year-old Birgen wandering around the house in their nightclothes. The kids shaken but unharmed were in police custody last night , awaiting the arrival of relatives, police said. They seem to be coping okay , said Cmdr. David Kalish. Actress Cassandra Peterson best known as Elvira , Mistress of the Dark said in an interview published yesterday on the Mr. Showbiz Web site that Hartman's marriage was troubled. They fought a lot , said Peterson , who was pals with Hartman for 20 years. But at the moment , they seemed to be doing fine. She added , I hope she shot him in his sleep. I hope he wasn't staring down the barrel of a gun. She said Hartman didn't have a weird secret life he was a clean slate and a great guy. As for his wife , Peterson didn't mince words. She was a very troubled person with a lot of problems , said Peterson , who added that she tried to talk Hartman out of marrying her in 1987. One neighbor said the marriage was in trouble though nobody expected it to end in violence. I knew they were having marital difficulties , neighbor Andrea Diamond said. It was building but this was totally unexpected. Brynn Hartman , a sometime actress, grew up as Vicki Omdahl in the small Minnesota town of Thief River Falls and changed her name when she moved to Hollywood. Fred Slater, manager of the Buca Di Beppo restaurant near the Hartman home, said Hartman's wife spent about an hour there with a female friend Wednesday night. We left them alone , Slater said. The two women were making jokes like they always did. A neighbor , Susan Kaplow, said Brynn Hartman showed no sign of distress Wednesday. She left me a really happy message , Kaplow said. Everything was fine. The four-bedroom , five-fireplace,4, 300-square-foot English-cottage-style home where the tragedy played out is shielded from prying eyes by stands of trees.  ",

   "input": "WASHINGTON - Orders for factory-made goods that signal business investment plans fell for a second straight month, part of a mixed report on manufacturing in November. Overall factory orders rose 1.8 percent, the Commerce Department said yesterday. The largest increase since July was chiefly because of a surge in airplane orders, which can be volatile from month to month. Demand for so-called core capital goods, such as computers and electronic equipment, declined 1.2 percent after a similar drop in October. Economists pay closer attention to this category because it can be a good indication of business investment, which drives economic growth. Still, the decline may be temporary. A private survey showed this week that US factories ended the year with their best month of growth since late spring. Factories hired more workers last month, saw the most growth in new orders since April, and ramped up production, the Institute for Supply Management said Tuesday. John Ryding and Conrad DeQuadros, analysts for RDQ Economics, said they are more likely to overlook the weak report on factory orders after seeing the more positive ISM survey. A bigger issue for US factories may be Europe 2019s debt crisis. Many economists believe that Europe, a major market for American goods, has already slipped into a recession. Economists also expect that economic growth in Asia will slow in coming months as well. Both could weaken demand for US goods and slow growth. The government report on factory orders also showed: Demand for durable goods, items expected to last at least three years, rose 3.7 percent, reflecting gains in demand for airplanes, autos, and industrial machinery.

   "input": "When you first meet him, Ai Weiwei seems as solid and impassive as a pillar of granite. He leads the way into his home without a word, then sits silently at the head of a long wooden table. But on the wall of his elegant, open-plan home, in the outskirts of Beijing, hangs a single image: of a hand with its middle finger raised. Ai has plenty to say. Indeed he has so much to say that the 53-year-old is not only China's most famous living artist, but also a constant irritant to its authorities. When Tate Modern announced recently that it had commissioned him to fill its Turbine Hall later this year, it was a welcome reminder of his work, which in recent times has become almost overshadowed by his social and political criticism. Ai is now perhaps best known for his angry and sustained denunciations of officialdom through interviews, documentaries and above all the internet. Around 26,000 people follow his volley of outrage and satire, facts and aphorisms, on Twitter: No outdoor sports can be more elegant than throwing stones at autocracy; no melees can be more exciting than those in cyber space , read one recent missive. People often say I started to become too outspoken after a certain period. It's all because of the internet 2013 if we didn't have this technology I would be same as everybody else; I couldn't really amplify my voice , he says. But the voice itself was forged in his earliest childhood. I experienced humanity before I should. When I was very young , he says. If that sounds grandiloquent , consider his history: Ai spent years of his childhood in a labour camp in the far north-west of China, on the edge of the Gobi desert. His father, Ai Qing, was an artist and one of China's most revered modern poets, but fell foul of the late 1950s anti-rightist campaign. Life was precarious, and his parents had little time to spare for their offspring. It was like being a little boy in the centre of a storm. Just always scared or surprised by surroundings that you cannot make sense of. And you have no comparisons because you have no memory of what another life can be , he says. Ai Qing , a cosmopolitan intellectual who had translated symbolist poets, spent years cleaning toilets. Sometimes he shared stories with us , like his early [years] in Paris and the kind of paintings and artworks he liked 2013 always things full of joy, says Ai Weiwei. But it had nothing to do with our surroundings 2013 they were very tough. For years he wouldn't take one day off. We always saw him as this very tired worker coming home with no energy; just having to lay down and sleep. On a good day , Ai Qing would rouse himself and amuse his children by sketching for them. His ability to depict a scene in a few simple lines captured his son's imagination, but he never encouraged his offspring to take up art. I guess that's kind of the way he tried to protect us , because hundreds of thousands of artists and writers were being punished, severely, says Ai. Instead , a family friend pushed Ai into applying to the Beijing Film Academy. It was 1978 and the cultural revolution was over, and the students flocking through its reopened doors included the now celebrated film directors Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige. For many it was a heady, inspiring atmosphere in which they could embrace creativity and explore western culture. To Ai, it seemed stifling and doctrinaire. All I wanted was freedom , because my life had always been under these circumstances of strong repression and pressure, he says. So in his early 20s he packed up and moved to New York for good 2013 or so he thought. That was quite a shock. I was a young person from the Gobi desert , who grew up almost having no electricity, who was suddenly dropped into this city full of energy and speed and all kinds of craziness, he says. His hazy image of the US had been largely derived from Walt Whitman's poetry and other early Americana. I loved New York 2013 every inch of it. It was a little bit scary at that time , but still, the excitement was so strong 2013 visually and intellectually. It was like a monster. But 12 years later , when his father fell ill, he moved back to Beijing. He did so with little to show for his time in the US, at least to the outside eye. I hadn't become very rich or got status or become part of the American dream 2013 I had no success. I hadn't got my school diploma [or] American citizenship 2013 that's unique for the early Chinese students in the US; those are two things they all got. I was unmarried , didn't have a real job, couldn't drive. So my mother really thought I'd never been there. She was shy to even introduce me to her friends, he says jokingly. Ai's father sensed his discomfort on returning and offered some advice: don't be courteous. Treat this country as your home. Do whatever you want. The artist is still grateful for those words , though one feels the Chinese government may be less so. Ai helped to design the Bird's Nest national stadium for the 2008 Olympics 2013 then blasted the country's disgusting political conditions and the use of the games as propaganda. Since then he has championed a number of sensitive causes , notably internet freedom and justice for children who died when shoddy schools collapsed in the devastating Sichuan earthquake. Others have fallen foul of the government for far less, and supporters fear Ai's position and his father's reputation will only shield him for so long. Certainly, the authorities seem to regard him, increasingly, as a problem. His China-based blog has been closed down, his email account hacked into, and security officials have made inquiries at his bank. In Chengdu last year, police detained him and fellow activists to prevent them attending the trial of a campaigner investigating schoolchildren's deaths. In the furore, a policeman punched him in the head, leaving him with painful headaches; weeks later, while working in Germany, he underwent surgery after doctors spotted internal bleeding. Life is never guaranteed to be safe so we better use it when we are still in good condition , he says now. I always think that incident shouldn't have happened that way. Other than that . . . I don't want the bad memories , bad incidents, to stop me or have an effect on me. But he acknowledges a strong increase in danger from a state that seems increasingly intolerant of criticism. In December , a court jailed the well-known author Liu Xiaobo for 11 years for inciting subversion, one of the harshest punishments given to a dissident in recent years. Many had thought him relatively insulated from pressure, but his co-authorship of a call for political reforms proved unacceptable. The state is taking action against people who have peacefully demonstrated their ideas. They are writers 2013 all they did is to express their minds through the internet. So the pattern is very clear. The state tries to maintain stability by crushing any thought of making change , Ai says. It could happen to me , because I did the same thing and in many cases I went much further and deeper. But I always think the government can learn from their mistakes 2013 they should learn and should understand; they should be just as intelligent as anyone else. I have to be wishful [optimistic] in that sense. His father's experiences have left him , he says, with a sense of duty to speak for the generation , or generations, who didn't have a chance to speak out. And I also have to speak out for people around me who are afraid , who think it is not worth it or who have totally given up hope. So I want to set an example: you can do it and this is OK, to speak out, he says. And then , of course, there's his art. Ai's growing profile as a government critic has come swift on the heels of artistic acclaim for works such as his photographic series Dropping a Han dynasty urn , which captures his destruction of an ancient vessel. But to Ai there is no meaningful distinction between his art and the rest of his life: I'm not worried viewers will be distracted [by my activism] 2013 I am worried they will not , he says. I would never say I am just an artist or have some higher aesthetic values. In recent years even his work for galleries has become overtly political , blurring the boundary between art and activism 2013 at a recent show in Munich, his Remembering installation comprised 9,000 children's backpacks, in reference to the death toll of pupils in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. Attached to the outside of the Haus der Kunst, they spelled out a grieving mother's words: She lived happily for seven years in this world. Ai thinks the casual jobs he did in New York , babysitting and housecleaning, were as formative as the visual education or western culture he experienced there. In those days he hungered for success, he says, but it arrived long after he realised that it's not so important 2013 that life can be much bolder and stronger without that kind of recognition. Fame is a kind of burden , he thinks, giving him the responsibility to speak out as well as a certain space to do so. China's rise affects everyone , not just its citizens, he says. China still cannot offer any real value to the world except cheap labour , manufacturing and its own so-called stability. Besides that, I don't see any creative values and creative minds 2013 thinking 2013 that can be announced from China. It [needs] to have a more reasonable political structure which allows this kind of development to happen. But he says his relationship with the country has been strengthened by his struggles with it. He makes a noise somewhere between a laugh and a sigh when asked if he fears the authorities might bar him from returning to China one day. People have said , if you leave, you may never come back. Or they may not even let you leave. So this is always a cost you may have to pay, he says. But I don't want to restrict myself: when it happens , it happens. I have to deal with it, but not to prepare for it, because it is a kind of stupidity. If you prepare for it too much, you become a part of it.  ",

It began in 2008, when hunger and food insecurity spiked across the country as a result of the financial collapse. Congress authorized tens of billions of dollars for food stamps and other nutrition programs to slow the rise of hunger, but not enough to bring it back down to pre-recession levels. Last year, 49 million Americans suffered from food insecurity. Food stamp use has risen to historic levels, and food pantries are struggling to keep up with unprecedented need for their services. And instead of getting better, things are about to get much, much worse.

   "input": "From glittery eye makeup to punk chic, Mick Rock is the British photographer credited with constructing and capturing the subversive face of rock music 2013 from David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust to Debbie Harry's Blondie. His camera gave the world of music several of its most famous album covers, including Lou Reed's Transformer and Queen's Queen II. Now 65, and working with contemporary bands such as the Killers and the Black Keys, Rock has taken part in a new project designed to celebrate his best-known images. With the help of young Brooklyn singer-songwriter Danielle Parente, the veteran photographer 2013 who has homes in his native London and Staten Island, New York 2013 has been recreating his greatest hits. The man who shot the 70s calls his project The Revisit. To reconstruct a key Debbie Harry shot (which he calls Blue Debbie) , he used a Nikon DF camera with one of his favourite lenses, the 28mm that he used for a famous shot of Pink Floyd's Syd Barrett. Three members of Parente's band also joined her for a revamp of the Queen II cover, which itself had been recreated in the Bohemian Rhapsody music video. So much for nostalgia. Speaking to the Observer before the exhibition, Rock said he was unsettled by the dominance of image over music in the industry today. Present-day artists such as Miley Cyrus and Lady Gaga, he argued, operated primarily as visual products rather than creative musicians. When I was photographing in the 1970s it was to accompany the music. It was clearly adjacent to it , he said. We were living in a much less visual universe and before we took pictures we often used to lie down , light a joint and listen to the music. Now the song is a mere accompaniment to the images. Looking back at his work , Rock said it was clear that the music business had changed. This may be a golden age of photography , in as far as many people can take a lot of quality shots, he said. But we are all now so aware of the power of imagery that in the case of someone like Miley Cyrus , and even with Lady Gaga, clearly the image comes first. I know what Miley Cyrus looks like, but have to admit I don't really know what she sounds like. After meeting Bowie in 1972 , Rock took the famous shots of the singer making himself up as Ziggy. The images had come to symbolise the era, he said, yet they had no idea they would last. In those days , you didn't know if your pictures would have any afterlife, so in a funny way they were more disposable, said Rock. A photo session was more relaxed. These people were friends of mine , whether it was David, Debbie Harry, Lou Reed, Iggy Pop or Freddie Mercury. Drugs were a part of the path to creativity. I had to take LSD before I could pick up a camera , he said. That , and the yoga I was practising from early on, opened me up. I have become so universally identified with that era that they say I shot the 70s , Rock said. But I never shot REO Speedwagon , the Carpenters or the Strawbs. He did , however, shoot well-known images of Pop, Mercury, Bryan Ferry, Mick Jagger, Alice Cooper and Reed. I might have been a writer or a lecturer if I had not picked up that camera , said the former Cambridge modern languages student. Certainly that is what my mother thought. She was very concerned at the time. Now , at 93, she feels a bit differently. She knows I am a relic. He first turned to rock photography after university precisely because it was not cerebral , so he finds it hard to accept that his work is now on show in museums and cultural centres. What was once rock'n'roll and very disposable is now art. My vision , for better or worse, has been pure music, he said. Rock suspects his old collaborator Bowie is equally disconcerted by the modern emphasis on image over music. It is true that a lot of my images defined David , but I always think of him as being magical and super-intelligent. He doesn't always like being taken quite this seriously as a cultural figure, I think. He did not want to be directly involved with the recent V&A show about him. David is quite a light spirit and his main concern is his music. That can get a bit lost now. Rock said he regards his own talent as an aptitude rather than a creative vision and that he has thousands of unseen images of Bowie from the Ziggy Stardust era 2013 and possibly more of the late Lou Reed. Although Rock thinks drugs were a useful way of opening up his own mind to a new way of life , he said he did not believe they were crucial to the artistry of the stars he photographed. Lou's song Perfect Day was a love song really , I believe, he said , referring to the persistent claim that Reed wrote the song in praise of heroin. There were a certain amount of chemicals involved then for many of us , it is true, but it was almost peripheral, really. Creatives are creative people and they are going to create whatever. These days , the kind of cool cats that Rock photographs are rather different. If I am taking shots for pleasure now , I tend to take them of my Maine Coon cat. It really is a spectacular breed, he said.  ",

Home automation is rapidly becoming a major tech category unto itself. The deal will let consumers control household items such as lamps, security cameras and thermostats from their Windows PCs, phones and tablets, and Microsoft will sell Insteon hardware kits in its stores. It sounds like a sensible partnership, and it is. But it 2019s also evidence that the Microsoft of 2014 2013the one run by Satya Nadella 2013is a whole lot humbler and more sensible than the one which dominated the industry for so long. The old Microsoft was often prescient when it came to identifying emerging categories. It entered them aggressively, usually with its own technologies and almost always with a Windows-centric perspective on the world. Its goal was to crush the competition. Sometimes the strategy worked: That 2019s how we got Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer, both of which reached 90 percent-plus market shares in their respective categories. But it also led to plenty of stuff which never went anywhere, such as the Microsoft SPOT platform for devices such as smartwatches, the Plays for Sure system for copy-protected digital music and Windows Media Photo, an alternative file format to JPEG for storing digital photos. If home automation had started blossoming a decade or so ago, it 2019s likely that Microsoft would have devised its own platform 2013let 2019s call it Windows for Your House 2013and would have tried to topple the standards of the day, which included Insteon as well as perennial rivals ZigBee and X10. It 2019s possible that such a gambit would have succeeded. But it seems even more likely that it would have been a waste of everybody 2019s time. Which is why the partnership with Insteon is such a refreshing move, in line with other recent Microsoft developments such as it release of a capable version of Office for Apple 2019s iPad. The company still needs to provide millions of people with clear reasons to dump their old copies of Windows 7 and 2013bleeecch 2013Windows XP and move to Windows 8.1. It also has to provide reasons to choose a Windows Phone over an iPhone or an Android handset. The new Insteon support is a small-but-meaningful incentive, in a way that some new Microsoft technology would not be. An important point: Microsoft hasn 2019t given up on the view that as new gizmos come along, they should all be based on Microsoft technologies. At its BUILD conference last month, it talked about a new shrunken-down version of Windows for 201cInternet of Things 201d devices. Among its potential applications are household appliances. And the company is giving the operating system to hardware makers for free, which certainly sounds like an attempt to grab lots of market share as quickly as possible. But whether or not you ever own a toaster that runs Windows, future versions of the operating system for PCs, phones and tablets will work with the hundreds of devices which already support Insteon.

   "input": "Richard Wilson's 20:50. Photo: Antonia Reeve Collections of Richard Wilson's work rarely appear in galleries; but anyone whose interests involve slicing ships in half or suspending swimming pools upside down generally requires a wider environment for their megalomania. Wilson's idea of moving house is to cast a full-scale steel skeleton of his home in Streatham and transplant it, upside down, to a remote spot in the Japanese countryside. Most famously, he flooded the Saatchi Gallery with sump oil for his seminal installation, 20:50. This inky masterpiece started life as a Portuguese shoe box. Wilson had the idea while on holiday in the Algarve, and with nothing at hand to realise his plans, pedalled off to the nearest village in search of modelling materials. Thus it was that, with the help of some children's poster colour, an abandoned carton became the blueprint for the most influential British installation project of the past 20 years. This candidly revealing exhibition gives the shoe box pride of place, alongside other diagrams and doodles. It is a chance to engage with Wilson's grand projects at a Lilliputian level, in the form of the small cardboard maquettes and technical diagrams that first emerge from his drawing board. It gives the most grandiose architectural interventions an intimate, personal feel. Naturally Wilson finds scope to turn this office clear-out into an installation project in its own right. At first sight, it looks like an earthquake in a stationery cupboard. The space is littered with grey filing cabinets, subjected to the Wilson gorging-and-gouging treatment so that the contents are glimpsed through gutted, mechanical innards. Nearby, in a DVD interview, Wilson deadpans about how he and a team of Middlesbrough engineers armed with heavy cutting equipment spent several months turning a decommissioned dredger into a ship sandwich. The one thing he steadfastly refuses to reveal is just how deep that tank of sump oil in the Saatchi Gallery really is. I always say to people , he demurs, that it's as deep as you want it to be. 00b7 Until April 7 Details: 0114-278 2600.  ",

Industry analysts said the 71-store chain cannot continue to operate much longer under the current conditions. 201cThe company 2019s cash position is lousy, 201d said Kevin Griffin, publisher of the Griffin Report on Food Marketing. 201cIt 2019s in a really tough spot right now. 201d More evidence of the financial troubles came in a letter posted Monday on a Facebook page critical of the company 2019s current management, in which the chief executive of a major seafood supplier announced that his firm was cutting its ties with Market Basket. Boston Sword & Tuna 2019s chief executive, Tim Malley, said in an interview that his company normally sells $10 million worth of seafood to Market Basket annually. But in recent weeks, he said, payments did not arrive on time. He said one check had to be returned because Market Basket overpaid him by $415,000. Malley said he decided to disclose the problems to show the economic damage being inflicted on the businesses that rely on Market Basket. 201cWe thought about the other vendors like us that were losing thousands of dollars, 201d he said. A spokesman for Market Basket said the company had worked with Boston Sword & Tuna to try to find a solution. He said in a statement that the problems with vendors were inevitable, given the decision by company employees who have refused to work, in solidarity with Arthur T. 201cThe longtime employees that ran Market Basket 2019s buying and distribution system walked out on their jobs, their customers, and their vendors on July 18, 201d the statement said. 201cWe do understand the problems that the shutdown of the distribution system has caused Market Basket 2019s vendors who are caught in the middle of this situation. We have been diligently working with vendors to limit the damage the walkout has caused. 201d Market Basket 2019s board met Monday in Boston to address the crisis. It is unclear how much longer the company can continue to pay employees and keep stores open as the daily losses mount. A person briefed on the company 2019s finances said it has begun exploring a line of credit to keep funding basic operations. After brokering negotiations Sunday night, Patrick and Hassan issued statements saying that Demoulas family members were making progress in resolving their dispute. But no deal appeared imminent Monday, and Patrick declined to discuss the matter. Other than the vow to work toward an agreement by Friday, there were no details on Monday about when or where the two sides would meet again. The Demoulas cousins have been fighting over ownership and management of the company for more than two decades. Arthur T., whose side of the family owns 49.5 percent of the business, has offered to return as president and buy the rest of the company 2019s shares, all of which are owned by Arthur S. and other rival family members. The negotiations on Sunday, which took place in Patrick 2019s office in Springfield, included Arthur T. and Arthur S., board chairman Keith Cowan, and Tina Albright, representing one of the shareholders on Arthur S. 2019s side of the family. It is unclear when or if the governors will convene another meeting to try to reach a deal. Their involvement signaled a final push to end the extraordinary showdown over the company, which has put thousands of Market Basket 2019s part-time employees out of work and is threatening the jobs of thousands of full-time workers. Market Basket has more than 25,000 employees in New England. The vast majority of its employees work at stores and other facilities in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. The Demoulas family has been at odds since the 1990s, when Arthur S. 2019s side of the family won a lawsuit finding that Arthur T. 2019s father, Telemachus, had defrauded them out of their shares in the company. A judgment awarded Arthur S. and his relatives $500 million, but it kept the ownership of the company almost equally divided between the family factions fighting over it. Despite the feud, the company has prospered in recent years. It is reported to have had revenue of $4.6 billion in 2013 and is ranked by Forbes as the 127th-largest private company in the United States. Many onlookers have been confounded by the continued inability of Arthur S. and Arthur T. to reach a deal to save the company from financial ruin. 201cI just can 2019t understand why you would want to kill the golden goose, 201d Griffin said. 201cThis is a business these two inherited. They were born into the lucky club, and you wonder why they can 2019t wise up and get their act together. 201d  ",

Fiat UK launches the entertaining new Fiat 500 in January, a retro-styled car that looks and feels just right. Although fun to drive and a doddle to park, it's bigger than its famous predecessor, the Fiat 500 Nouva of 1957 (the last were made in 1975), designed in every last detail by Dante Giacosa. Safety regulations demand chunkier cars than those of the era of Gina Lollobrigida and La Dolce Vita. The 500, though, is quite a bit smaller than a beefy BMW Mini and a much more convincing car altogether than VW's retro-Beetle. Designed in-house by Fiat's Style Centre, Turin. February sees the publication of a new edition of Le Corbusier's strident and seductive manifesto, Toward an Architecture (Frances Lincoln, paperback 00a317.99), first published in 1923. This was the world of architecture's equivalent of the Communist Manifesto - a clarion call for a radical new architecture, it included the dictum, the house is a machine for living in. The first English translation , by the artist Frederick Etchells, was published as Towards a New Architecture in 1927. Frances Lincoln describes the 1927 edition as second-rate and sprinkled with blurry photographs. Now , at last, we can read Le Corbusier, newly translated by John Goodman, in all his revolutionary glory. Once you've read the man, see his work. Le Corbusier: the Art of Architecture promises to be the most comprehensive, and fresh, exhibition of the great Swiss-French radical's paintings, furniture, book design, interiors, polemics, drawings, photographs, films and buildings (which, still largely misunderstood in Britain, remain the most unexpected and moving of all Modern architecture). The show will open in the glorious crypt of Liverpool's Metropolitan cathedral, then move on to London. The crypt is the only part of a titanic domed cathedral designed by Edwin Lutyens, Britain's greatest architect of the first half of the 20th century, to have been realised. Many visitors to Frederick Gibberd's 1960s space-capsule cathedral above are wholly unaware of this baroque cavern below their feet. God only knows what Le Corbusier would have made of it. 00b7 Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ the King, Liverpool, Oct 2-Jan 18 2009 (0151-709 9222).

Organised by publisher and architectural impresario Peter Murray , and chaired by novelist and biographer Peter Ackroyd, this year's festival is spread across five hubs (or parts of London). Its theme is Fresh! , and it's about new ideas and attitudes concerning architecture, design, public places and, yes, food. The 2008 festival will host the Architecture Student Festival, while foreign embassies are being lined up to showcase the work of their countries' best architects. Amid all the vibrant, 24-hour, world-class designs on show, the festival also promises old-fashioned guided tours of London architecture on foot and on bicycle. 00b7 Various venues, London, June 20-July 20 (020-7436 8625). The much-travelled Emperor Hadrian (AD76-138) was an ambitious and impressive builder. He loved architecture not just for what it represented - the might and magnificence of Ancient Rome - but for its own sake. His villa at Tivoli stretched through many pavilions set in extensive parkland; the size of a town, it remains a wonder to idle through. He rebuilt the Pantheon into one of the true wonders of historic architecture. He built the Temple of Zeus, and an aqueduct, of course, in Athens, and, he is remembered best in Britain for his famous stone wall that still stretches, coast to coast, across the Cumbrian and Northumbrian countryside. Expect much about clashes of civilisation, but expect, too, a fresh look at one of the world's greatest architectural clients, who, very possibly, had a hand in the actual designs of the imposing structures that bear his name. 00b7 British Museum, London, July 24-Oct 26 (020-7323 8000).

   "input": "FORTUNE 2014 Who needs polite conversation when you have the American legal system? Corporations unhappy with shareholder proposals are taking their frustrations to federal court, suing investors instead of, you know, working things out with them. In recent months, corporate law firms have awakened to the prospect of a new revenue stream as companies like Express Scripts and Waste Connections have used the federal courts to sue small investors and prolific proposers 2014 and have won. But last week, decisions in two cases could turn the tide. Small shareholders won victories in suits brought by tech firm EMC EMC and advertising giant Omnicom OMC . The spate of corporations suing their own investors is quite a shift from the past, when lawsuit was considered a dirty word to business people everywhere. In the 1990s and part of the 2000s, lawyers who represented customers, shareholders, or employees with gripes against companies were the bogeymen executives loved to hate. In 1995 and 1997, Joe Nocera wrote in Fortune about silicone breast implant and tobacco settlements in articles with titles like 201cFatal Litigation 201d and 201cThe Plaintiffs Bar Strikes Again. 201d In 2000, George W. Bush slipped into office promising to tame out-of-control lawyers who were, according to the talk of the day, destroying our economy and capitalism by suing companies and reaping large settlements. In 2001, BusinessWeek amplified the attacks on the plaintiff 2019s bar with a cover story titled 201cThe Litigation Machine. 201c MORE: Are you entitled to overtime pay? In the EMC case, which was decided in Massachusetts federal district court, the winning defendants did their own lawyering. Citing a recent Supreme Court ruling, the defendants asked the court to dismiss EMC 2019s lawsuit on the grounds that the federal court did not have jurisdiction since there was no impending threat that the defendants would harm EMC. 201cEven if EMC could demonstrate that it faced a high probability of an SEC enforcement 201d if the company decided to exclude the proposal from a vote, such harm would come from the SEC, not the defendants, they argued. Judge Mark Wolf agreed with the defendants, saying there was 201cno standing and no case or controversy, 201d and even if there were, he would not issue the judgment EMC wanted. The EMC case involved a proposal to require that the board chair be an independent director. EMC had made some (but not all) of its arguments about the proposal to the SEC before suing its shareholders. The SEC offered an informal view that the shareholder proposal should be included and brought to a vote. 201cI regard [bringing the case to court] as an inappropriate practice of depriving the SEC of the opportunity to perform its proper role of considering all the grounds that in this case have been argued to me and giving informed advice, 201d the judge said at a hearing on Friday. Further, he noted, 201cabetting an end run around the SEC deprives shareholder[s] of a relatively inexpensive opportunity to get claims disputes resolved. 201d EMC public relations officer Dave Farmer said in a voice message, 201cEMC is exploring all its options, and beyond that, EMC wouldn 2019t be commenting on the case. 201d Judge Louis Stanton of the Southern District of New York wrote the following in the Omnicom case: 201cThis case raises the question whether a corporation that has sufficient doubt whether it is entitled to exclude a shareholder 2019s proposal from its proxy materials should consult its attorneys and follow their advice, with the common risk that a court may later hold to the contrary. 201d He noted that 201cThere are thousands of public companies in the United States; they have annual meetings, and their shareholders are free to suggest items for inclusion in their proxy materials. 201d Again, the judge found no 201cactual or imminent 201d harm that would give Omnicom 2019s suit standing. Despite these victories, the corporate rush to federal courts is troubling. Lawsuits take up court time and can be a forceful intimidation tactic. In 2012, Chevron cvx subpoenaed investors 2019 correspondence with the media and others related to shareholder proposals. Chevron chose the 201cnuclear option, 201d it was like 201ckilling a mosquito with a sledgehammer, 201d says Tim Smith, a senior vice president at Walden Asset Management. 201dWe are in the process of re-filing the three shareholder resolutions from last year. In addition, Walden Asset Management has filed a new resolution citing Chevron 2019s harassment of long-time shareholders, 201d he wrote me in an email. MORE: Herbalife and the FTC 2019s uneven history with pyramid schemes If shareholders grow reluctant to submit proposals, companies will be less accountable for their actions. And investors will then have fewer opportunities to bring positive changes to companies, like voting on whether the election of a director should require more than one yes vote (as has been the case at companies like Cablevision and Impax Labs) or if businesses should provide additional information on environmental liabilities. As it is, shareholders have limited resources. And some companies receive insufficient shareholder focus.. For example, the Comcast-Time Warner merger has attracted plenty of attention, but 201cinvestors should be concerned that John Malone is handing additional voting power to CEOs at two companies with significant governance weaknesses, 201d Dana Wise, deputy director at CtW Investment Group, wrote me in an email. 201cDiscovery has had persistent pay for performance misalignment and problematic pay practices for three consecutive years. John C. Malone serves on the boards of six additional publicly traded companies, which is excessive. At Liberty Global, we see a similar misalignment of CEO pay for performance and governance problems. Shareholders should be engaging these companies to address these problems. Granting more power to the CEOs of these companies should be of great concern. 201d Meanwhile, the corporate shareholder lawsuit train keeps chugging along. The defendants in the EMC case now face a similar suit from Chipotle CMG in Colorado federal district court.

A Portland, Oregon, woman claims she was fired for taking too many bathroom breaks when she was pregnant with her second child.

He told her not to bother, the lawsuit said.

   "input": "Ann Killio, San Francisco Chronicle Photo: John Froschauer Associated Press San Francisco 49ers head coach Jim Harbaugh adjusts his cap before an NFL football game against the Seattle Seahawks, Sunday, Dec. 14,2014, in Seattle. (AP Photo John Froschauer) San Francisco 49ers head coach Jim Harbaugh adjusts his cap before... As 49ers 2019 season winds down, distractions are ramping up For a 7-7 team that is out of the playoffs and should be relatively irrelevant, the 49ers certainly are insistent on gobbling up headlines and media space. If the first-place Warriors and world champion Giants and competitive Sharks expected the 49ers to fade gently into the good night with their playoff elimination, well, good luck with that. This week, the 49ers hit a trifecta on the news front: hot coaching rumor, disturbing police investigation into a player and ability to infuriate fans, all in one day. First, the Jim Harbaugh-to-Michigan rumor. On Wednesday, there was a report that Michigan has offered Harbaugh a six-year, $49 million contract that would make him the highest-paid college coach. The report has yet to be refuted and there are new reports that Harbaugh is 201cconsidering 201d the job at his alma mater (how could he not be for that price?). Most believe that Harbaugh would prefer to stay in the NFL, and eventually hoist a Lombardi Trophy as his brother and his archrival, Pete Carroll, have. Michigan could be sometime in his future, but not now, while he 2019s in the prime of his career. But that kind of payday could change the script. More interesting is the fact that the offer was leaked. That sets Harbaugh 2019s compensation bar at about $8 million. That makes sense: that 2019s what Sean Payton, the most highly paid coach in the NFL, makes. That 2019s the price range Harbaugh wants to be in, whether it 2019s in college or pros. Harbaugh has one year left on his deal, which pays him $5 million a year (his brother John makes $7 million). Harbaugh heading to Michigan would thwart the 49ers' plans to trade him for something, but that scheme is probably a pipe dream, anyway. Second, the Ray McDonald sexual-assault investigation and subsequent release by the 49ers. General manager Trent Baalke described McDonald 2019s problems as 201ca pattern of poor decision making, 201d which, of course, could also describe much of what the 49ers have been up to in recent months. It 2019s difficult not to take a cynical view of an organization that crows about 201cdue process 201d when it thinks it is a Super Bowl contender and can be helped by a player under investigation, but abandons it 2019s due-process stance once it is out of the playoffs and the player has done the bulk of his work for that year 2019s salary. Would the 49ers have been as tough with McDonald, who has been playing well the past month, if they were still in the postseason picture? I doubt it, but then I 2019ve been a good student of the 49ers 2019 season-long tutorial in cynical moves and mercenary actions. And if the 49ers had taken a tough approach with McDonald early in the season, could this subsequent police investigation have been avoided? It was nice that Baalke showed up to answer questions instead of letting the head coach 2014 whose job is to win games 2014 answer all queries about team philosophy, standards and accountability. But the CEO and acting owner Jed York appears to have borrowed the invisibility cloak his parents have worn for so many years. Since tweeting an apology to fans for the Thanksgiving night loss to Seattle, and saying that the performance was not acceptable, York has gone back into hiding. He has yet to apologize to fans for helping turn his team into a psychodrama, for not stopping the constant leaks that distract from the team, for failing to articulate a clear vision and standard for his $1.6 billion franchise. Is 201ca pattern of poor decision making 201d now the standard? Where does that place Aldon Smith and Chris Culliver, who have their own disturbing patterns? Is there a standard, or a knee-jerk reaction? Baalke said every situation is different, but is it the situations that are different or the team 2019s competitive reality that changes the response? Third, on top of all of that, the 49ers managed to further infuriate their fans. As the McDonald news was coming down and the Harbaugh rumors were bubbling up, the team chose that moment to e-mail fans with notification of how they can pay for their season tickets for 2015. The e-mail said that the 49ers were committed to making the experience of season-ticket holders 201crewarding and memorable. 201d The frayed allegiance of many fans is already beginning to snap, with the relocation, the high prices, the substandard product, the off-field misbehavior, the lack of accountability by the team. Not sure how rewarding this inaugural season in their new stadium has been, but it has certainly been memorable. What could go wrong has gone wrong.

In 2011 as the print journalism industry continued to decline, she joined Gannett 2014 the largest U.S. newspaper publisher 2014 as Senior Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer. After successfully navigating the company through the spinoff of its publishing unit to help the profitability of the business, Banikarim is jumping into another industry rife with its own set of challenges. On Wednesday, Hyatt Hotels H named Banikarim global chief marketing officer. After moving from New York City to Chicago with her family, Banikarim will be tasked with shaping the future of Hyatt just as the hospitality industries maneuvers through a similar disruption as editorial. People around the world are becoming more focused on experiences, says Banikarim, putting that much more pressure on Hyatt and its competitors to up their games for guests around the world. Mark Hoplamazian, Hyatt 2019s president and chief executive officer, said Banikarim 2019s experiences in publishing and media is 201chighly relevant to our own plans to take advantage of similar disruptive forces. 201d In an interview with Fortune, Banikarim spoke about why she left Gannett GCI , her inital plans for Hyatt and how her two teenage children affected her decision to take the job. What spurred you decision to leave Gannett? It was the right time. I came to Gannett for the transformation and the company is now in an entirely different place than it was when I started. In August, we announced that we were splitting and that Gracia [Matore, CEO and President of Gannett and No. 43 on Fortune 2019s Most Powerful Women list) would be taking over the publishing unit. The split allowed me to have a moment to think about what I was going to do next. Now we [the digital broadcast side of the business] is going to be a $2 or $3 billion company when I was in $6 billion company when I started. I was very committed to Gracia though and it was a bitter sweet decision. What about the hotel industry interests you? The fit was uncanny. I didn 2019t think it would happen so quickly, but sometimes the most uncanny things happen when you don 2019t expect. I always said that if it wasn 2019t going to work in media, I would work in retail or hospitality. They are all very similar industries. They are all engaging and experimental. Customers have an emotional response to a Hyatt the way they do to the story that they love. Don 2019t get me wrong they are different businesses, but there is something incredibly interesting in that they are all very focused on their consumers. What are you goals for Hyatt? When your think about what people are interested in right now, we are much more interested in experiences. Partly because of social, we share so much of our stories with so many more people now. That is a huge opportunity for the hospitality category. There is a huge opportunity for community when it comes to hospitality brands. If you are a Hyatt person, there are certain things you expect because you begin to identify yourself as you stay in one place. There is so much untapped potential, because the world is changing and there is room to innovate. Hyatt has this incredible brand. All those things mean new and different things as we move into the future. What do you see as your biggest challenge moving forward? Being patient. When you come into a new organization you have to spend a good amount of time listening and learning and you have to come up with that process for listening and learning. You have to take the time to understand the nuances before coming up with a plan forward. I have learned that lesson over time and it is a particularly important one as I think I about this next stage. You have two teenage children. How did that impact you decision to leave New York City for Chicago? I was a kid who moved a lot for various reasons. As a mother, and I bet as a father too, you take into account this as part of your considerations. It is such an incredibly important thing for your kids to experience living in different places. As hard as it might have be in the beginning, it makes you resilient. In today 2019s world, if you can 2019t be flexible and agile and go with change, you are at a disadvantage. None of us want hardship for our children, but over time they will recognize they got something out of it. What lessons do you hope your children learn from you through this change? Being willing to go out of your comfort zone to continue to evolve and grow. That is an incredibly important part of everyone 2019s life and career path. I am more risk tolerant than most people, but one wouldn 2019t be human if you didn 2019t have anxiety about change. But you sort of just have to lean in and go with change.

Now he 2019s walking that fine line between celebrated journalist (with a lecture tour that will take him to Berlin, Paris, Johannesburg, and the Hague) and man on the run. 201cMuckrakers 201d is set in Mira 2019s Brooklyn studio apartment, which Mira and Stephen enter having come from a gala event, Stephen in a tux (tie undone) and carrying a bottle of champagne, Mira in a glittery silver dress and carrying her heels. It turns out that Mira 2019s unnamed organization has given Stephen an award, but it can 2019t afford to put him up in a New York hotel, so Mira has volunteered her flat, where she 2019s planning to pump him for information she can upload to her website. She 2019s looking for the bare facts; he 2019s more interested in the bare Mira. Set designer Alexander Grover 2019s vision of the one-room apartment is appropriate for a woman who, we eventually learn, works at a coffee shop. Mira converts her sofa to a bed by arranging the cushions on the floor, and she has an air mattress for Stephen. The furniture is mostly milk crates; the walls are littered with posters ( 201cVote Socialist, 201d 201cKate Nash, 201d 201cFree Pussy Riot 201d). There 2019s a sink, a microwave, a wicker laundry hamper, a metal file cabinet, and, significantly, a laptop. But neither the play nor New Rep 2019s overall production quite matches that level of authenticity. Lewis D. Wheeler, Oxbridge accent firmly in place, is a boyish, sympathetic Stephen who neatly embodies his statement that 201cpeople have their contradictions. 201d He becomes less sympathetic as Mira starts to ask whether he posed as gay to gain Andy 2019s confidence and we see those 201ccontradictions 201d in action. Arsenal Center for the Arts, Black Box Theater, Watertown 617-923-8487. Dohrn 2019s Mira, on the other hand, is a one-dimensional poster girl for transparency. The character needs some softening, but director Bridget Kathleen O 2019Leary and actress Esme Allen have made her an unappetizing mix of smirky, sneaky, sophomoric, and self-righteous. She doesn 2019t even offer sex with any grace. (The script calls for a considerable degree of nudity, some but not all dimly lit, and New Rep bravely obliges.) For the first half of the play, Wheeler and Allen are stuck with an unedifying scenario of tipsy flirting; they improve, Allen in particular, once they 2019re allowed to get serious. At the end, 201cMuckrakers 201d turns on a couple of well-executed plot twists, one involving Mira 2019s father, the other that laptop. But the play still has too many ideas and not enough humanity. Playwright Dohrn explores the murky terrain between public and private  ",

How do you make a video saying , 'If your child should die, could you please donate to my niece?' says Bloodgood , who is currently starring in TNT's . I wrestled with that but at some point you get over it because you're trying to save someone's life. The quickest way to help Olive would be for the parents to do a direct donation. What we found out is , God forbid, is if they are in that circumstance where they have to make a decision about their child they can direct donate the organs. The parents can say who they want the organs to go to , she says. It's something I feel horrible talking about but Olive just took a turn for the worse and we are desperate for a heart-lung transplant and they have to come from the same person.

   "input": "Updated FEB 24, 2015 8:12p ET On the far east of China, in the city of Shandong, rises the gigantic Mount Tai (T 00c3 i Sh 00c4 0081n, on its original language), one of the five sacred mountains of Taoism. Its highest peak, the Jade Emperor, is an inspiration and adoration center. Not for the faint of heart though, for it's really difficult to reach its summit. The harsh trip to the top is reserved for men of great patience and discipline. This is due to the fact that it has 6,600 stone steps that go all the way to the top, and it takes an average of 4 to 6 hours of strenuous physical effort to complete the trail. In the summit of this great mountain, a 20-year-old man said to himself: I can be great , I can be huge, and one day people will look up to me with admiration, just like Mount Tai. This is how the story of Taishan Dong was born , the heavyweight that has joined Golden Boy Promotions. He arrived in the U.S. in order to fulfill his dream of becoming the next heavyweight boxing champion. The 7-foot, 286-pounder is preparing to take his country's name to the highest point. Without any previous amateur boxing experience, he still has a 2-0 record, both victories by KO. The next stage on the road to become a champion will be against Roy McCrary (3-2, 2 KO) Feb. 27 at Fantasy Springs Resort and Casino (FOX Sports 1, 10:30 p.m. ET). Another step to take on the road to the top of the boxing world. He is often called The Great Chinese Wall , due to his size , and through a translator we found out he loves it when he's called by his nickname. I like to feel big , exceptional. Taishan said. Taishan's introduction to sports started with basketball and kickboxing , but his dream of becoming a champion made him trade the hoop for the ring. He had no trouble adapting, The transition wasn't really hard , nowadays I have to concentrate on fewer things, since I only have to apply punches and protect the upper part of my body. In fact , after taking into account his height, a lot of people would expect him to be slow and unathletic, but truth is quite the opposite. The boxer from Beijing has an astounding agility, the same that made Tommy Washington Jr. fall so easily on his second bout as a professional. I don't get nervous before a boxing match , he said. I focus and ponder on the strategy to follow , what I need to do in order to beat my opponent he adds. I chose boxing because it's a challenge for me , and I love challenges The new Golden Boy star is going on the right track , his features are perfect in order to become a heavyweight champion, and he knows what this would entail for all of his countrymen: Mr. (Oscar) de la Hoya wanted to open the Chinese market 'cause he believes in me , he knows I can become a champ. That's why he wishes that more opportunities in the boxing world become available for his countrymen: I would love to see more Chinese boxers coming to the U.S. to show their talent , to see the best of both countries. So far the experiment is working. Taishan has won over both the public and boxing fans , since many admire the courage the boxer had to leave his native China. George (Gallegos , his agent) has been the most helpful so far. Although I miss China, the will of succeeding in the US is stronger. I reckon I still have three years or so to reach my highest level and after that I can go back to my country as a champion, knowing that I made it. McCrary will not face a novice. I have learned so much from the two previous fights , Dong said. I've got new skills. Nowadays I am more patient and can overcome any challenges that arise during the fight , he said. I will give the best of myself. I will try to understand my opponent's strategy from the beginning and therefore defeat him. The Chinese giant anxiously awaits this upcoming fight and has gone as far as ensuring that My maximum potential has not been revealed yet. That is why I train hard , in order to become a world champion. With his height , his punching speed and his imposing figure, Taishan prepares to climb another step of a new summit with his hands up high. Then he can look down and relive what he felt at the top of Mount Tai, the same feeling that inspired him to be the biggest boxer in China, the one that made him feel that he had the world at his feet.

The llamas -- one white, the other black and a bit smaller -- demonstrated some nimble moves in eluding numerous attempts by law enforcement officials and bystanders to capture them before eventually being apprehended -- the black one via lasso.

   "input": "EIGHT YEARS IN ANOTHER WORLD By Harding Lemay. 246 pp. New York: Atheneum. $10.95. I might as well admit that I adore soap operas or, as they are known in the trade, ''daytime dramas.'' I am overjoyed when an attack of the flu enables me to stay home and, without guilt, turn on the televison set for a visit to all-American towns with names like Salem and Madison and Bay City. My favorite soap is ''Another World,'' in which several clans of predominantly blond blue-eyed characters vie for love, wealth and power (but mostly for love). Imagine my delight at the news that Harding Lemay, who was the head writer of ''Another World'' for eight years, had written a book about his experiences. Imagine my dismay at the realization that Mr. Lemay, even though (or perhaps because) he made a bundle from his work in daytime TV, still regards a taste for the soaps as the love that dares not speak its name. Mr. Lemay, a respected editor, left his publishing job in 1967 to devote himself to writing. Four years later, after the publication of a well-reviewed but commercially unsuccessful autobiography, he found himself as broke as the greenest freelance writer. That, he explains at painful length in his new book, is why he took the job as head writer for a soap. I have always been fascinated by the fact that the soaps (in spite of their predilection for WASP names and looks) bear a much stronger resemblance to life as it is ordinarily lived than most shows on prime-time television. This is not solely attributable to the daily format; the best prime-time shows in recent years, such as ''M*A*S*H,'' ''All in the Family'' and ''Lou Grant,'' use many of the techniques that were pioneered on the much-maligned soaps. These include changes in the characters over a period of time; family and personality conflicts that are never fully resolved; and ''mixed'' characters, with a combination of good and bad traits. One of the major innovations Mr. Lemay was responsible for on ''Another World'' was the use of these mixed characters in place of the old saints-and-sinners formula. One example was Pat and John Randolph and their ill-fated marriage. (John, alas, has since been killed in a fire and is presumably in purgatory, as befits a mixed character.) When Mr. Lemay became head writer, Pat - the perfect wife and mother - was being poisoned by a housekeeper who wanted John for herself. Mr. Lemay dispensed with this ridiculous plot device and introduced a story line in which Pat's and John's conflicts revolved around the realistic frustrations of a young mother at home and of a husband obsessed with his career. The sponsors thought this was pretty dull stuff, but, as might have been predicted, it struck a responsive chord with the daytime audience. The daytime soaps were dealing with a host of major social issues, especially those involving relations between the sexes, long before they appeared on prime-time TV. It is regrettable that Mr. Lemay devotes so little space to the cultural phenomenon of the soaps and so much to his personal difficulties with sponsor's representatives, producers and actors. HONEST BUSINESS A Superior Strategy for Starting and Managing Your Own Business. By Michael Phillips and Salli Rasberry. Illustrated. 209 pp. San Francisco: Clear Glass Publishing Company. Random House. Cloth, $10. Paper, $6. So you're a terrific cook and people have been telling you for years that you ought to quit your boring 9-to-5 job and sell your special ragout to a hungry world. Before you take out a second mortgage to open a catering business or food shop, take a look at this book of sound practical advice from authors who combine an obvious zest for small-scale capitalism with the necessary degree of fiscal caution. Don't be fooled by the breezy West Coast tone and the plethora of businesses with names like Skin Zone (which sells soap, not porn magazines), Communion (a restaurant, what else?) and the Pickle Family Circus. Most of the businesses mentioned in these books are solvent and extremely successful. Michael Phillips, who was a vice president of the Bank of California at the age of 30, has been a consultant to hundreds of small businesses, and he is a founder of the Briarpatch Network, an association of more than 450 small businesses on the West Coast. Salli Rasberry is a weaver and writer and the author of ''The Rasberry Exercises.'' The most controversial viewpoint expressed in this book is the contention that limited capital can be an asset in starting a small business. Approximately 70 percent of new businesses fail each year, and lack of capital is the reason most commonly advanced. Not correct, say the authors. Lack of attention to detail and unrealistic expectations about the business's first-year profits are more apt to be responsible. This book does not suggest that people should go into business with inadequate capital. It does urge prospective businessmen and women to start small, borrow as little as possible and check out the demands of their customers in practice instead of basing the initial investment on theory. In this view, a newly established caterer would be much better advised to rent major equipment rather than buy it. (I saw a superb caterer go out of business in my neighborhood last year because she had invested a great deal of money in pastry ovens and found her customers were more interested in buying cold meats, salads and soups.)

   "input": "THE voice on the telephone was a clear, forceful tenor. ''This is Bob Gibson,'' the man said. ''Bob Gibson, the pitcher?'' I said. ''Who the hell do you think?'' ''Well,'' I said. ''I'm an admirer of your work.'' ''Do you think I'm worth a column?'' asked Bob Gibson, the pitcher. All this was a decade ago, and what brings the conversation back is Gibson's joining the Baseball Hall of Fame this year, along with Johnny Mize and Rube Foster. He made it on the first ballot, as he should have. Next Sunday he will be inducted at Cooperstown, and a bust of his even-featured face will be placed where it belongs, beside those of other super pitchers, Feller and Mathewson, Koufax and Hubbell, and also beside that of Jackie Robinson, whose awesome competitive ferocity Gibson shared. ''Bob wasn't just unfriendly when he pitched,'' says Joe Torre, who played with him in St. Louis and hired him to coach intimidation into the Mets' staff. ''I'd say it was more like hateful.'' Gibbie never spoke to opposing hitters. He threw at chins and noses, and, when truly upset, he gunned a fastball at your ribs. A man can move his chin and nose, but a Gibson fastball at the ribs was almost certain to connect. After that, the batter coughed for perhaps a week. He had no tolerance for defeat and little respect for reporters' questions that he considered foolish or uninformed. By reputation, he was a hungry lion, which is why that call from his home in Omaha was so surprising. (We had a common friend in Nebraska, who felt the press was writing only Gibson's harsher side. The friend had prompted the call.) ''Sure you're worth a column,'' I said. ''Well, when do you want to come out?'' he said. ''Tomorrow?'' It was a cold January evening, but in those days you knew even in January who would pitch opening day for the St. Louis Cardinals. We agreed to wait until April, when the Cards would begin their season against a competent team of Chicago Cubs. He was matched against a young Ferguson Jenkins, and you could see early that nobody was going to score many runs. The young Jenkins was a power pitcher, even if not so powerful as Gibson, and this April afternoon he was very, very good. The teams went into the bottom of the 10th inning tied at 1-1, when no less a figure than Stan Musial eased into the seat next to mine. ''What do you think?'' I said. ''Change speeds,'' Musial said. ''The mound is in sunlight, and the plate is in shadow, and that makes it hard to pick up the ball.'' Gibson fired a hard slider for a strike. The change went high. He was following Musial's knowledgeable formula. He wound up and threw a buzzing low fastball, and Billy Williams hit it halfway to Lake Michigan. That's all there was. There wasn't any more. The Cubs had beaten Gibson, 2-1. Musial shook his head, then grinned his easy grin. ''You gonna talk to Gibson now?'' ''We've had a date since January,'' I said. ''Better you than me,'' Musial said, laughing. Forewarned, I took my time. I chatted with Chicago writers in the press box and chatted more with Cub officials in the press room. At length, I caught a taxi to the Cardinals' hotel and advised the driver not to hurry. When I arrived, I found four messages from Gibson. The first wondered where I was. The fourth said pointedly that he was hungry and mentioned a restaurant where I might join him. He was sitting by himself, looking regal rather than solitary, as he ate an appetizer and drank a vintage Beaujolais. ''Where you been?'' ''I didn't think you'd want to talk right away after losing a game like that.'' A look of annoyance crossed the darkly handsome face. ''Did you come out here to work, or play around?'' ''Work.'' ''All right,'' Gibson said. ''Now one of the things that annoys me about the press is that you always read that hanging curves get hit.Hanging curves and sliders that didn't break. But this is the major leagues, and that isn't what happens all the time. Sure they hit the hanging curves, but they hit good pitches too. I made a helluva pitch to Williams, and he belted it. He just beat me. I didn't make a mistake. Williams beat me.'' The wine mellowed the mood, and the hungry lion before me became a proud and sensitive man. He had been given few enough breaks in a life that began in an Omaha ghetto. He had known poverty and bigotry as a boy, and what he later achieved had come out of discipline and hard work and passion. The records inscribed on his plaque tell a little of Gibson's story. He won 251 games in 17 major league seasons and won seven more in three World Series. In one incredible season,1968, he started 34 games, completed 28, won 22 and finished with an earned run average of 1.12. Great relief pitchers, who work in brief spurts, approximate e.r.a.'s like that. No one has matched it across 300 innings. His style on the mound was cold and impatient. He pitched quickly - batters would say, ''It's like he's coming at you every eight seconds'' - and his great assets were tremendous speed and superb control. His best pitches were his fastball, which moved in wicked ways, and a snapping slider, almost as quick. By his own description, his curve was ''fair,'' and, he says, ''I had a kind of bad pitch, a change-up slider, which I'd throw once in awhile to right-handed hitters.'' He threw one knuckleball in his career, characteristically challenging one of the best, Henry Aaron. Hank hit a long line drive, and Gibson retired the knuckler. His family moved to Omaha from Alexandria, La., and his father died a month before Bob Gibson was born, on Nov. 9, 1935. His mother supported her children as a domestic and by working in a laundry.

   "input": "JOHN W. MATTHEWS, Democratic candidate for Nassau County Executive, says ''the arrogance of the Republican party with its corruption and taxation'' will be the main theme of his uphill campaign against County Executive Francis T. Purcell. Mr. Matthews views Mr. Purcell as a ''handcuffed giant,'' beholden to Joseph M. Margiotta, the Republican chairman, and he asserted that the Republicans were presiding over one of the highest-taxed counties in the nation and a government that has been racked by scandals, including the recent bribery conviction of General Services Commissioner Francis O'Connor and the indictment of Mr. Margiotta. Mr. Purcell, who is seeking a second four-year term, said he expected such charges. ''The Democrats always run negative campaigns - that's why they don't win elections,'' he said. The County Executive said that during his regime, spending had leveled off not counting inflation and that he had kept county-tax increases below the level of school-tax raises. The County Executive contest is the most important on the Island this November and one of the most significant in the metropolitan area. The County Executive is not only the chief administrative officer of the state's third most populated county, but also the source of patronage and access to business contributions that can have a major impact on a party. The Democratic party of Nassau has been comatose since it lost the County Executive p ost a decade ago. Nassau politicians noted that Democrats had often tried to translate the corruption and taxation issues into victories but that on a county level, their two major victories in the last two decades - the initial elections of Eugene H. Nickerson as County Executive and Denis E. Dillon as District Attorney -were largely attributed to voter reaction to Republican scandals. Mr. Matthews, who had fund-raising problems in his primary contest with Assemblyman Lewis J. Yevoli, said he hop ed to raise up to $500,000 with the already-assured help of Sta nley M. Fink, Speaker ofthe State Assembly, and the third-ranking Dem ocrat in the Assembly, Arthur G. Kremer, chairman of the Ways and Me ans Committee. Mr. Kremer and Mr. Matthews live in Long Beach. The Democratic candidate said he also hoped to enlist Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Lieut. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in the fundraising. Both will be seeking re-election next year and would presumably welcome the exposure in Nassau. Mr. Matthews did not mention Governor Carey, whose popularity, according to polls, is low at the moment. Mr. Purcell will spend at least $400,0, but he does not have to worry about raising the money. The Nassau Republican organization would do that just as it does for most G.O.P. candidates - one of the few areas left where candidates are not on their own in fund-raising. Mr. Matthews said he would campaign as a liberal Democrat, although he acknowledged that Irish Catholic voters, many of whom are considered moderately conservative, would be the ''swing vote'' in the election. Both he and Mr. Purcell are Irish Catholic. The Democratic candidate said he did not consider liberalism politically passe: ''Ask the senior citizens who now see what conservatives can really do to them, or the parents of children whose school lunches will be cut,'' he asserted. Returning to the corruption theme, he noted that Richard Williams was still the county insurance agent even though Mr. Williams conceded having kicked back up to $500,000 in commissions to Republicans designated by Mr. Margiotta who did little or no work for the money. It was Mr. Margiotta's role in that system that led to his indictment, a hung jury at his first trial and a trial scheduled for November -after the election. Mr. Purcell defended Mr. O'Connor as the victim of a ''bum rap.'' As for Mr. Williams, he said there was no evidence that the county had been overcharged on its insurance or that the premiums might be reduced if they had not been split with politicians. Noting that Mr. Williams was a witness for the prosecution in Mr. Margiotta's trial, Mr. Purcell said he would have been criticized ''if we fired him.'' Mr. Williams has also pleaded guilty to tax evasion but has not been sentenced. Mr. Matthews said he would also press for a requirement that officials make full disclosure of their finances. Mr. Purcell said he would run on his record - ''spending down, construction up.'' Robert McDonald, Mr. Margiotta's aide, said polling indicated that Mr. Purcell's record was not well known. ''He's such a low-key guy - he doesn't communicate as much as he should,'' Mr. McDonald said. Mr. Purcell sees the highlights of his record as fiscal stability, including a 5-percent growth in spending and a 1-cent reduction in the sales tax; a cut in welfare cases to their lowest in 14 years, turning the Coliseum in a for-profit venture, development of the remaining portions of Mitchel Field and the start of construction of a waste-water treatment plant. Mr. McDonald said the Purcell record would be trumpeted in an extensive television campaign to be created by Roger Ailes, the onetime Nixon media man and Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato's advertising adviser for part of last year's Senate campaign. Another veteran of the campaign, Arthur Finkelstein, is handling the polling for Mr. Purcell and the organization. The organization expects to spend $200,000 for Mr. Purcell's television advertising and $30,000 for radio advertising - a considerable ''buy'' considering that much of the advertising will be seen and heard by people outside Nassau. Mr. McDonald said the G.O.P. would ''basically ignore'' the corruption charges and Mr. Matthews. ''It doesn't affect Purcell,'' he said. That would be standard strategy for an incumbent who is considered the favorite. Mr. Purcell will campaign with local candidates but not Republicans from outside the county. ''There is still a good Republican trend, '' Mr. McDonald said. Illustrations: photo of Francis Purcell photo of John Matthews  ",

   "input": "When he was killed in a bomb blast yesterday at his offices in Teheran at the age of 47, Mohammed Javad Bahonar had been Prime Minister of Iran for a little less than a month. Although Dr. Bahonar was largely unknown in the West, former President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr had described him as one of the five most important men in Iran. From the declaration of the Islamic Republic in February 1979, after the ouster of Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi, until his death, Dr. Bahonar was among the central group of Moslem fundamentalists who assisted Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in reshaping the nation of 37 million people. As a member of the secretive Revolutionary Council - the inner circle of policy advisers and administrators created by Ayatollah Khomeini that ruled the country for a year and a half -Dr. Bahonar was linked closely to the group that finally wrested complete control of the Government from more moderate factions represented by Mr. Bani-Sadr, who was forced from the presidency in June. Dr. Bahonar's crucial role in the policies and Government was stressed by Mr. Bani-Sadr, who in a recent interview in Paris described him as one of the five key leaders in Iran, along with President Mohammed Ali Rajai, Hojatolislam Hashemi Rafsanjani, the Speaker of Parliament, and two other mullahs, Abdulkarim Musavi Ardebili and Mahdavi Kiani. ''If tonight five men were killed -Rajai, Bahonar, Rafsanjani, Ardebili and Kiani - the Government would collapse,'' Mr. Bani-Sadr said. ''There are no structures left, there are only a few persons who hold power together.'' According to an official biography distributed by the Iranian Foreign Ministry, Dr. Bahonar was born to a poor family in Kerman, a city in southeastern Iran, and attended a religious primary school there. Later he went to the holy city of Qum to study theology under Ayatollah Khomeini, and literature. According to official records, Dr. Bahonar was arrested in Teheran in the early 1960's for activities against the Shah's Government. In 1962 he and Mr. Rajai set up an underground political group, the biography said. Attained High Clerical Rank In the 1970's, according to the official information, Dr. Bahonar published tracts about Islam and maintained contact with Ayatollah Khomeini, who had been forced into exile in Iraq and then France. Apparently during this period he attained the rank of hojatolislam, a term for an Islamic clergyman one step below an ayatollah. Though a senior clergyman, Dr. Bahonar preferred to be known by his academic title. According to Pars, Iran's official press agency, Dr. Bahonar was instructed by Ayatollah Khomeini in a message from Paris to organize strikes and protests against the Shah's regime. Afer the overthrow of the Shah in early 1979, Dr. Bahonar was made a member of the Revolutionary Council and served in the group that drafted Iran's new Constitution. He was appointed to his first formal post in the Government as Deputy Minister of Education two years ago, serving under Mr. Rajai, who was then Education Minister. Last March, six months after Mr. Rajai became Prime Minister, Dr. Bahonar was named Education Minister. Named to Lead Ruling Party The extent of his influence became clear when he was named leader of the Islamic Republican Party, the dominant political group, after a bomb blast on June 28 at the party's headquarters that killed Ayotollah Mohammed Beheshti, the party leader and Chief Justice of Iran. Diplomats in Teheran at the time described Dr. Bahonar as having been a close aide to Ayatollah Beheshti. A month after the bombing, Mr. Rajai assumed the presidency of Iran following an overwhelming election victory, and he promptly named Dr. Bahonar his Prime Minister, describing him as a committed scholar and Islamic crusader. On taking office, Dr. Bahonar declared that his Government would purge the country of leftist opponents of the Islamic administration, a statement that was seen largely as directed against the People's Mujahedeen, an Islamic Marxist group that the Government has held responsible for the bombing of the Islamic Republican Party headquarters. His brief period in the prime ministership was marked by widespread executions of leftists. As Prime Minister, Dr. Bahonar also promised to revive Iran's economy, which has been hard hit by the 11-month-old war with neighboring Iraq.  ",

   "input": "LOUISVILLE, Ky., May 1 2014 About six hours before the Kentucky Derby was run today, a bugle sounded at Churchill Downs for the first race and a roar resounded among the early arrivals of the 141,009 people who annually congregate for America's most famous horse race. Hearing the bugle call, one horseplayer smiled at another. ''They're playing our song,'' he said. Soon the band, in blue uniforms inside the first turn, was playing other songs as the infield filled up more quickly than the clubhouse and grandstand did. The infield, which is open only on Derby Day, accommodates nearly 100,0, only a few of whom actually see the race because of the wire fence that blocks much of the view. Not that they care. They are there to see one another, not the race. The infield was where the young were hanging out, mostly in shorts and T-shirts. ''I am the person,'' the words read on one young lady's shirt, ''your mother warned you about.'' Mother was probably in the clubhouse or the grandstand, in a silk dress and a big hat. Specialty Concession Stands In the infield, the concession stands were specialty shops - beer and soda at one, franks at another, souvenirs at another and mint juleps at another. Including its souvenir glass, a mint julep cost $3.50, but at the souvenir shops, the same glass sold for $2.25 empty. Which meant that a little bourbon, a little sugar, a little sprig of mint and a lot of ice were worth $1.25. The souvenir shops in the infield even sold sweatshirts and Tshirts that blared ''Infield Kentucky Derby'' as if the clubhouse and grandstand didn't exist. Under the cool shade of the grandstand in the hours before the 108th Kentucky Derby, older people sat on little camp chairs and stared at a TV set that displayed the tote-board odds. Over in the clubhouse, dapper men and fancy women were having lunch before going out to watch the races leading up to the Derby. Stances Differ During the Wait Along the backstretch this morning, the Derby horses were awaiting the race differently. El Baba stood quietly inside his stall, seldom peering out. Air Forbes Won had the door of his stall closed. Laser Light appeared calm. Star Gallant was having his legs massaged. Cassaleria, the one-eyed horse, stood against one wall of his outdoor stall, perhaps asleep. But in another stable, Royal Roberto was moving around impatiently, snapping his teeth at his trainer, Jimmy Iselin. ''He's ready to run,'' Iselin said. ''He knows he's going to race and he's ready.'' ''When it started to sprinkle for a few seconds around 9:30 this morning, I was worried,'' the trainer said. ''If the track got bad, I knew I would have to scratch Royal Roberto no matter what. People say there's only one Derby, but there's only one Royal Roberto, too. I wouldn't want to risk him on a bad track.'' But all week Louisville had been building up to the Derby, even with a boat race. What is known here modestly as ''The Great Steamboat Race'' was held on the Ohio River late Wednesday afternoon. The winner was the Natchez, followed by the Delta Queen and the Belle of Louisville. As proof of the importance of that three-boat race to the local populace, a ''Muppets'' television show was interrupted for a news bulletin on the finish. Thursday, the Derby Festival parade stopped downtown traffic. But by today, the only thing that mattered here was which horse would have its name painted next to ''Pleasant Colony 1981'' above a row of concession stands in the rear of the clubhouse area. Among the charms of Churchill Downs are the names of all the Kentucky Derby winners, beginning with Aristides in 1875, that adorn the clubhouse and grandstand area. And above a concession stand where three women were dispensing soda and draught beer, there was a space for Gato del Sol, today's winner. His name and the year, like that of all the others, would be put up there for posterity in gold paint.  ",

   "input": "Archibald MacLeish, distinguished poet, playwright, statesman and man of letters, died last night at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, which he entered March 20 for treatment of an undisclosed illness. He was 89 years old and had lived in Conway, Mass. Few American writers achieved the occupational diversity that Mr. MacLeish did. He was a soldier, lawyer, magazine editor, Librarian of Congress, director of the Office of Facts and Figures, Assistant Secretary of State for Cultural Affairs; a founder of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization; Harvard professor, television dramatist and gentleman farmer. Above all, though, he was a poet, who drew his themes from the large social and political issues of the day as well as from the more private emotions of daily life. It was an achievement recognized by three Pulitzer Prizes and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. His latest book, a collection of letters edited by R.H. Winnick, will be published this summer by Houghton Mifflin. When Mr. MacLeish was moved, he was passionate and engaged, and he gave his verse a whiplike quality designed to flick the conscience of his readers. In ''Frescoes for Mr. Rockefeller's City,'' ''Public Speech'' and ''America Was Promises,'' all written in the 1930's, he excoriated laissez-faire economics and declaimed the cause of the common man. In ''America Was Promises'' he wrote: The Aristocracy of Wealth and Talents Turned its talents into wealth and lost them. Turned enlightened selfishness to wealth. Turned self-interest into bank books: balanced them. Bred out: bred to fools In contrast, according to Mr. MacLeish in the same poem: The people had promises: they'd keep them. They waited their time in the world: they had wise sayings. They counted out their time by day to day. They counted it out day after day into history. In the 1930's Mr. MacLeish not only championed the commonality but he also seemed to want to write for them. His ''Panic; a Play in Verse,'' which dealt with the bank crisis and had some harsh words for financiers, was staged before a group of workers and the unemployed. They responded so enthusiastically that he said, ''Now I have found my audience.'' Writer Involvement Urged At the same time Mr. MacLeish prodded his fellow writers to detach themselves from the ivory tower and become involved in the issues of the day. His urgings grew more pointed as Nazi Germany threatened the world with war, and he offended some intellectuals by accusing them of preaching pacifism to ''a generation which would be obliged to face the threat of Fascism in its adult years.'' Although Mr. MacLeish's social consciousness was no less keen in the 50's and 60's, many of his poems in this period seemed to have more personal than political content, to be metaphysical and questing. In ''Autobiography,'' for example, published in 1968, he wrote: What do I know of the mystery of the universe? Only the mystery - that there was a mystery: Something opposite beneath the moon to this. But I who saw it - who was I? And who am I who say this to you? All I know now of that world, that time, is false. The poet also turned to vexatious philosophical questions that carried religious implications. These were explicated in ''J.B.,'' a verse drama based on the Book of Job, which won for its author his third Pulitzer Prize. His first two were for poetry. McCarthyism and War In his application of moral philosophy, in both poetry and prose, Mr. MacLeish sought to avoid the abstract, and in so doing he was often a plain-speaking controversialist. Out of concern for the moral well-being of America he exhorted the nation against the McCarthyism of the 1950's, against military involvement in Southeast Asia, against the anti-Communist concepts of the cold war and against the Americanization of the world. He believed that these policies represented a false realism and that they were not in tune with the democratic and visionary idealism of most Americans. Mr. MacLeish was a reclusive writer. For him the mechanics of creation involved hours of penciling in a crabbed hand in the solitude of his study on a farm in western Massachusetts. What he was striving to do, he explained once, was ''to stop the flowing away of the world long enough so that you can grasp it for a moment.'' Commonly Known as Archie Outside his study Mr. MacLeish was the most gregarious of men, informal and talkative. He was ''Archie'' even to casual acquaintances. In the latter part of his life he lived much of the year as a gentleman farmer in Conway, a somnolently pastoral town where he had purchased a home in 1920. He often dressed in cheap blue cotton trousers, a blue workshirt open at the throat, white socks and scuffed brown loafers. His dress in Antigua, where he spent the winters, was equally without pretension. Yet he carried about him a slightly aristocratic air, the result perhaps of moving in his youth among the socially privileged. Born in Glencoe, Ill., on May 7,1892, he was the son of Andrew and Martha Hillard MacLeish. Andrew, once described by his son as ''a cold, tall, rigorous man of beautiful speech, '' was a Glaswegian who settled in Chicago and became one of its leading department-store magnates.  ",

   "input": "THE individual who accepts the conventional wisdom may feel threatened in holding a mere handful of stocks but will do it anyway to make a big profit. That's a conclusion of Thomas E. Conine Jr. and Maurry Tamarkin who seek to explain why many individuals do not diversify but concentrate on two to four stocks. Dr. Conine has a Ph.D. in finance from New York University and is associate professor of finance at Fairfield University in Connecticut. Dr. Tamarkin has a Ph.D. in finance from Washington University, St. Louis, and is associated with Clark University in Worcester, Mass. Dr. Conine said in a telephone interview that investors have generally been told to diversify for safety - spread capital among 10 to 15 holdings. But studies of income tax returns and Federal Reserve Board surveys of the financial holdings of individuals indicate that they typically own two to four stocks. This implies rejection of the investment wisdom of modern portfolio theory. Prof. James Tobin of Yale University won the 1981 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science for the argument that investors should put their investment eggs in many baskets. Dr. Conine and Dr. Tamarkin have published the results of their study in a recent issue of The Journal of Finance. They say that as the investor adds stocks to a portfolio, risk undoubtedly is reduced. The investor finds this to be desirable but at the same time faces an undesirable reduction in the chances for a big killing. Dr. Conine and Dr. Tamarkin attempt in their paper to find the greatest satisfaction for the individual through the balancing of these two effects. ''Under these circumstances we believe it may be rational for individuals to hold fewer stocks than safe diversification would indicate,'' Dr. Conine said. Dr. Conine said that academicians were now studying whether stocks in fact offered opportunities for a big killing. He said that an intuitive motivation for seeking a killing was that an investor could never lose more than 100 percent of his or her money, whereas gains are potentially unlimited. A spate of professionally managed portfolios - the 44 Wall Street Fund, the Istel Fund, Growth Industry Shares Inc. and Sherman Dean, among them - have concentrated holdings in relatively few stocks, according to Lipper Analytical Services. Their apparent popularity with investors reflects the attitude that they have a better chance for big gains than funds that buy many stocks. Widely diversified funds tend to reflect the market itself, and the market, according to the pioneering University of Chicago study, has experienced an average annual gain of 9 to 10 percent since 1926. That percentage still holds. What then is the individual investor to do? Can he safely buy a few stocks or is he risking disaster? Wall Street professionals have long argued that it is difficult even for a professional to know more than a few companies well. Thus, it may well be that the individual investor reduces his risk somewhat by knowing a few companies. In fact, the late stock market authority, Gerald M. Loeb, called diversification a hedge against ignorance. ''Diversi fication is a balm to many who don't mind taking a chance on something a little sour in a mixed list, figuring on the better ones to pull it out and make a good average,'' he said. ''The greatest safety for the capable lies in putting all your eggs in one basket and watching the basket.'' Neither Dr. Conine nor Dr. Tamarkin would necessarily agree. Both believe in the efficient market theory of stocks in which current market price of a stock reflects all relevant information. This theory is widely accepted in academic circles. ''There is substantial evidence supporting both weak-form and semi-strong form of market efficiency,'' Dr. Conine said. He added that weak-form efficiency says that security rates of return are independent through time. The implication is that historical price cannot be used to exploit the stock market. The major implication of this is that technical analysis will not produce above average returns. Semi-strong form market efficiency says that current security prices reflect all available information. ''One cannot read in the newspaper that XYZ Corporation is going to split its stock and expect to profit from that announcement,'' by deciding then to buy the stock, Dr. Conine said. Strong-form efficiency maintains that no one - not even insiders - can outperform the stock market on a risk-adjusted basis. The jury, he said, is ''still out'' on the question of strong-form market efficiency. Dr. Conine does not necessarily agree, but regardless of the efficient market theories many analysts are able to turn up undervalued stocks partly because of a concentration of research effort on large companies suitable for institutional portfolios. Smaller companies, then, offer the astute a chance to make a killing. Dr. Conine acknowledged that some studies support this theory.  ",

But the film is slow going with its mix of stilted political discourse and restless village folk just looking to celebrate life and dance. At times, it 2019s like 201cFootloose 201d gone didactic. Barry Ward plays man-of-the-people Jimmy Gralton, who in 1932 returns to his family farm in rustic County Leitrim after a decade spent living as an expat in New York. Gralton is barely in his mam 2019s cottage door when a number of the locals, particularly the youth, begin urging him to reopen a liberal cultural center he 2019d founded in the years before he left. As we 2019re shown through flashbacks, the village had had an opportunity to do it all at 201cthe Hall 201d: dance, study music and art, read poetry, even practice boxing. Most of all, they were encouraged to be free thinkers. This didn 2019t sit well with the establishment that emerged from the Irish republican conflicts of the period 2014 leadership, landowners, and clergy on board with the political outcome in a way that many were not. These traditionalists chased Gralton from the country back in the 201920s, and they promptly start muscling him now that he 2019s back. (They also tag him as a communist, as do the history books 2014 although as one character contends, 201cJimmy Gralton isn 2019t Karl Marx. 201d) The most vocal opponent of Jimmy and his hall is moralizing Father Sheridan (Jim Norton, TV 2019s 201cElementary 201d), who scribbles the names of the entire dance crowd on a publicly recited list of shame, and who conveniently looks the other way when official disapproval turns violent. Jimmy 2019s most devoted supporter is Oonagh (Simone Kirby), the soulmate left behind when he fled 10 years ago and who has never stopped pining for him despite quietly settling down. A scene of the two sharing a chastely romantic dance is a delicately lighted standout. The inherent drama of the story 2019s clash is solid, even if the finer points take some time to crystallize. It 2019s clear which characters are against Gralton, but between the complex historical politics and the cast 2019s thick brogues, the uninitiated may have some early trouble following whose interests are what, except in broad terms. The script 2019s frequent speechifying doesn 2019t always help. If anything, it further hampers the naturalistic performances that Loach only semi-successfully coaxes from his supporting cast. You might wish the film had been more willing to trade authentic peripheral faces for the polish brought by, say, Andrew Scott (Moriarty on the BBC 2019s 201cSherlock 201d) as a young priest unafraid to question Sheridan 2019s views. Ward could also have been given more opportunity to flash some charisma. His performance is capable but awfully retiring for a figure who 2019s supposed to be shaking up his sleepy town with his edgy views and affinity for Harlem jazz. 201cYou always had to be cock of the walk, 201d a police officer scowls at Gralton.

   "input": "Doly Castro, the owner of a cleaning business, posed for a portrait at her apartment. In Massachusetts, Hispanic women who clean offices and houses for a living make just 54 cents on the dollar compared with what male janitors make. Compared with their Hispanic male counterparts, Latina cleaners make just 59 percent. New research from the University of Massachusetts Boston shows that the already yawning gender wage gap becomes a chasm in lower-income jobs, particularly for Hispanic women. Many Hispanic workers are immigrants who tend to have limited education and English skills, and work in low-wage jobs, which could partly explain the disparity. But when Hispanic women are compared with Hispanic men working the same low-wage jobs, the inequity persists. 201cA lot of Latina women are concentrated in low-wage jobs, and a lot of low-wage jobs have significant gender- and race-based disparities, and Latina women seem to be consistently at the bottom, 201d said Ann Bookman, director of the Center for Women in Politics and Public Policy at UMass Boston, who analyzed median annual earnings of full-time Massachusetts workers in four occupational categories, using data from the 2013 American Community Survey. The wage disparity, she noted, 201cshows the complexity of this intersection between gender bias and ethnic bias. 201d Among cashiers and customer service workers, whose median pay tops out at $38,000 a year in Massachusetts, women make 88 percent of what men make, according to the analysis. But when wages are broken down by race, a further divide emerges. White women make 83 percent of what white men make in the field, while Hispanic women are at just 56 percent of their male equivalents. The research also revealed an unexpected statistic: Black women 2019s wages slightly exceeded those of black men among retail workers and showed a smaller divide than between white or Hispanic workers in other occupations. Bookman said she plans to delve further into the black wage gap. But the first phase of her research lasered in on Hispanic workers. Between her $9-an-hour job at Popeyes and her work at a homeless shelter, where she makes $10 an hour, Rita Diaz works more than 60 hours a week. Diaz,26, of Dorchester, is trying to save money for college but said she has encountered gender discrimination on her search for a better job. 201cSometimes they say, 2018No, I 2019m looking for a man, 2019 201d she said. Rita Diaz, a worker at Popeyes, took a customer 2019s order. UMass Boston research shows that Hispanic women face a wider wage gap, especially in lower-paying jobs, when compared with women of other backgrounds. Statewide, women earn 81 cents on the dollar compared with men, some of which can be explained by factors such as career choices and time off to care for children. But the divide that remains is widely attributed to bias, whether conscious or unconscious, and there is a growing movement around the country to shrink it. Boston has launched an unprecedented attempt to equalize salaries, starting by analyzing wages by gender at 60 local companies. At the State House, a bill is under consideration that would prohibit employers from seeking job candidates 2019 salary histories, and clarify an existing statute that employers must provide equal pay for comparable work. This could mean cafeteria workers, who are often women, would make the same as school janitors, who are usually men. But business groups say the proposed legislation would lead to all employees being paid the same regardless of performance, and breed a 201cculture of mediocrity, 201d according to Associated Industries of Massachusetts. The answer to helping low-income women lies not in legislation but in job training, said AIM spokesman Christopher Geehern. 201cGive those women the ability to create websites or program for big data and send them into the Massachusetts economy, 201d he said. The earnings gap for women of color is wider than it is for women as a whole, and for Latina women it is 201cegregious, 201d Bookman said: 50 cents on the dollar across all occupations statewide, compared with white men. Pay discrimination often goes undetected, but at Lahey Hospital and Medical Center in Burlington earlier this year, the US Department of Labor found that 38 female housekeepers, many of them from Haiti, were being paid 70 cents less an hour than their male counterparts, adding up to a $1,500 annual disparity. At companies that have studied their gender wage gaps, a major cause appears to be the abundance of men in senior positions. Arcelia Curiel,42, who is originally from Mexico, has worked mornings as a cashier at a Lowell school cafeteria for 10 years and cleaned offices at night for seven years, but has had few opportunities to get ahead. 201cWhenever they need to promote someone, they bring someone from the outside, 201d she said, speaking through a translator. 201cThey don 2019t really offer us a chance to move up. 201d This pay disparity is particularly damaging for mothers, Bookman said. In Massachusetts, she noted, women are the primary breadwinners in slightly more than half of all households with children under 18. And of those female breadwinners, 49 percent are single mothers. Doly Castro,30, originally from Guatemala, came to the United States for the opportunity to better provide for herself and her daughter, but is struggling to get by. She once signed up for an English course but couldn 2019t attend because of work and family responsibilities. Half of her income goes to pay for her $900-a month Dorchester apartment, which she is fighting to stay in after the building was sold. Both potential employers and landlords have questioned her dependability because she is a single mother, she said, but what they don 2019t understand is that providing for her daughter is what drives her. 201cMy own life, maybe that didn 2019t work out, 201d she said through a translator, 201cbut hers I think will. 201d  ",

For the second week in a row in NASCAR's Sprint Cup Series, the leader of the race ran out of gas, getting passed and losing on an empty tank. This time it was Joey Logano and Kyle Busch who took advantage, finishing 1-2 at Watkins Glen in New York as Kevin Harvick ran out of gas. It was the exact opposite of the previous week, when Logano and Busch were running 1-2 at Pocono in Pennsylvania, but both ran out of gas, giving up their chance at a win. Also for the second week in a row, title contender Kasey Kahne crashed and finished way back. His 42nd place at Watkins Glen was actually an improvement from his dead-last 43rd at Pocono. Being last and second to last in successive weeks is not how you qualify for the Chase, NASCAR's version of the playoffs. Just two weeks ago he was sitting pretty at a 77 percent chance of making it, but with these two terrible weeks, he has dropped far 2014down to a measly 12 percent. Contrast that to last week's numbers, when Kahne still had a good shot of making it back in, at 40 percent. One wreck he could handle, two is too much. Remember the Chase starts Sunday, Sept. 20. Kahne's teammate, Jeff Gordon, didn't fare much better. Gordon finished 41st at Watkins Glen, and has seen his Chase chances slide ever so subtly to 94 percent, down from 99 percent. There are only four races to go to decide who makes it in. Sixteen drivers will make it 2014and everybody else will be out. Kahne's only realistic chance of getting in is by winning one of the next four races. He's been able to sneak in that way in past years, so it's more than just theoretically doable. If not, he'll be the biggest name driver to lose out. That would be a disappointment compared to drivers like Jamie McMurray, Paul Menard, Clint Bowyer and Ryan Newman, who have generally not had the same level of career success as Kahne 2014yet all four of them are on track to crack the Chase despite being winless this season. How the Chase model works Remember the way drivers qualify for the Chase: (1) they have to be in the top 30 in points; (2) they have to win a race. (3) If fewer than 16 drivers meet the first two criteria, the remaining slots are given to the remaining nonwinners who are highest in the points standings. That's why Busch and all his wins might not make it in, because he's still 30th in points. And that's why winless Gordon will still get in, because he's high enough in the points standings. With four races to go before the Chase, it's most likely that we will see some new winners in that time. We've had 11 different drivers win a race so far this year, and the model suggests that number will go up. Look for a winless driver (like Gordon) to get his first win of the year in the next month. Here's our expectation for how many unique winners this season will have by the time the Chase starts: 11 unique winners: 21 percent (We're at 11 right now, so this means all repeat winners) 12 unique winners: 36 percent (So one additional new winner, with the rest being repeat winners) 13 unique winners: 26 percent 14 unique winners: 13 percent 15 unique winners: 4 percent (That means the next four races are won by four currently winless drivers) Andrew Maness at PitRho, a racing data and analytics firm, has a model that simulates the season 100,000 times based on each driver's performance in this season and in recent years. Not surprisingly, Harvick has the highest chance of winning the title, at 24 percent. He was last year's champion and has been consistently strong all year, finishing in first or second in almost half the races, and in the top 10 in almost every race.

Yellen said that research may provide evidence of what allows people to get ahead, and to predict how individual circumstances impact income inequality. It would also be beneficial to understand whether any policies may hold people back or discourage upward mobility , Yellen said in prepared remarks for a speech to a Fed research conference here on economic mobility. Read MoreUS joblesscontinuing claims lowest since 2000 Yellen tackled the issue of income inequality in a speech in Boston last October , saying she was greatly concerned about income disparity in the United States. Republican lawmakers seized on that speech , saying it was a partisan view meant to help Democrats in the November elections, with little relevance to the central bank's responsibility. That view resurfaced during Yellen's semi-annual appearance in front of Congress in February, with Republican lawmakers in the House of Representatives accusing the Fed chief of using the inequality issue to side with Democrats. Yellen fiercely defended her stance, saying that previous Fed leaders had addressed the issue of wealth inequality and that it remained an important economic view.

Generic versions of traditional pharmaceuticals can usher in discounts of as much as 98 percent. Biosimilars retain a much higher margin due to their more complicated manufacturing process, which can create a new version of a biotechnology drug but not an exact copy. As a result of that , with these new ones coming on we are probably going to be seeing something that looks like more of a situation where there are multiple brands, Brennan said. In the past that didn't give you 98 percent discounts. In the past , that would give you 40 to 50 percent discounts. Read MoreTelemedicine abortion case heads to court The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved on Friday the first biosimilar drug for use in the country , a copy of Amgen's Neupogen cancer treatment that was made by Novartis. Pricing on the biosimilar has yet to be determined. Drugmakers that are racing to develop biosimilars include Pfizer and Hospira. In Europe, Hospira already sells copycat versions of Neupogen and Merck's and Johnson & Johnson's arthritis drug Remicade. Other biosimilar players include Amgen, Biogen Idec, Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries, and Mylan. Biologic drugs have already been approved in Europe, but pricing varies as each country has a role in negotiating drug costs. Earlier this year, Express Scripts and CVS pitted two novel treatments for hepatitis C against each other to wrest large price cuts from their manufacturers, Gilead Sciences and AbbVie. Brennan said they are likely to use similar tactics as more biosimilars enter the marketplace. That could mean excluding one of the drugs from their reimbursement list for most patients, requiring patients to try the less expensive treatment first or insisting they give prior approval before a patient begins the medication based on their specific medical history, he explained.

The EEI is an index of emotions (anger, anticipation, fear, sadness, acceptance, disgust, joy and surprise) evoked by the those imagined scenarios. And the higher the score, the greater the emotional connection 2013and supposedly the greater the motivation to vote. So, who is most invested in a big win? Obama supporters, according to the survey. People 201cdefinitely voting 201d for Obama imagine a brighter future under his leadership, with an average EII score of 66 vs. 62 for McCain supporters. The survey also showed a generational divide: Younger voters tend to feel trust and support for Obama 2013and fear and sadness about the prospect of a McCain win. Meanwhile, older voters tend to feel joy and optimism as they envision McCain in the White House, and a sense that something is being taken away from them if Obama would win.

   "input": "How compassion became the secret sauce for my small business. By Mark Murrell , Black Point Seafood Five years ago, my business fell into my lap. I was living in Chicago, working as a marketing consultant for a variety of clients. An old friend of mine who owned a fish market in Bath, Maine, said he wanted to sell live Maine lobsters and seafood online. I decided to do some research for him before he got into something that wasn 00e2 0080 0099t viable or profitable. Little did I know that this exchange would later become the inspiration behind GetMaineLobster.com. I soon realized that there was a real business opportunity here 00e2 0080 00a6 if handled the right way. My friend lacked the resources and time to pursue this idea. So I decided to give it a try. Fast forward to February 2011, one day after the Super Bowl. I 00e2 0080 0099m in Las Vegas for a guys 00e2 0080 0099 trip with friends. My phone starts ringing off the hook. Customers are trying to purchase lobster off my website but can 00e2 0080 0099t check out. Where did this demand come from? I placed a deal on Groupon 00e2 0080 0094 people from all over the country flocked to it. The problem? I was a one-man show. I needed to buckle down for my new customers. That 00e2 0080 0099s when I realized I was in the business of delivering exceptional experiences. That 00e2 0080 0099s how I would keep my customers happy. I was in the business of delivering exceptional experience. That 00e2 0080 0099s how I would keep my customers happy. That was my eureka moment. I knew what I needed to do, but didn 00e2 0080 0099t know exactly how to do it. Fifteen years earlier gave me a clue. I was working at L.L. Bean in the call center during the holiday season, my latest stop in the hospitality industry. L.L. Bean is an exceptional company, one that makes bold promises and delivers on them. Most importantly, when they fail to do so, they always make it right. After working two holiday seasons, that mantra was forever ingrained in me. That 00e2 0080 0099s when I discovered the power of empathy. That 00e2 0080 0099s when I realized that many companies talk a big game about making their customers happy but do little to distinguish themselves in that area. That 00e2 0080 0099s when I found my competitive advantage. Now 00e2 0080 00a6 back to the lobsters. How would I grow my customer base and design an experience to meet their needs? How would I grow my customer base and design an experience to meet their needs? For the first two years, I didn 00e2 0080 0099t change anything at GetMaineLobster.com. I just tried to keep my head above water and treat every customer like a family member. But that wasn 00e2 0080 0099t enough 00e2 0080 0094 I knew that I had to make some changes. I just had one other person on my team. Lacking the best technology, we spent too much time on logistics. I needed to think less about logistics and more about the customer experience. So I hired one more person, invested in logistics technology, and started modernizing the business. My new promise? To deliver an exceptional experience from the dock to your doorstep. Sure, customers want to be treated fairly. But that 00e2 0080 0099s not enough. You can get all the technical details right, even ace the logistics. But you 00e2 0080 0099ll still be missing something: heart. My competitive advantage: I have a team that is really empathetic. They take it personally when something goes wrong with a customer and will do everything possible to fix it. There 00e2 0080 0099s always something that 00e2 0080 0099s going to come up 00e2 0080 0094 companies like UPS get that. My folks do the same for our customers. Our fondest memories happen around the dinner table. Lobster is a food for celebration. It 00e2 0080 0099s delicious, fun, messy, and an adventure. If we do our job right, we 00e2 0080 0099re delivering magical moments. Our task seems simple. But you must have empathetic people to execute it. Empathy, by definition, means the ability to understand and share feelings of another. That 00e2 0080 0099s not easy to do. We 00e2 0080 0099re all motivated by self-interest. So, what 00e2 0080 0099s our secret sauce? A recent customer summed it up best. Jeffrey in Buffalo explained, 201cYou guys treat me like a king. 201d This was tremendous validation. Here are four reasons why I believe Jeffrey came to that conclusion. In the end, we 00e2 0080 0099re a customer-centric, e-commerce company that happens to sell lobster. But really, we 00e2 0080 0099re in the business of selling empathy 00e2 0080 0094 and we 00e2 0080 0099ll never run out of stock.

According to estimates from Bain, the off-price luxury market will grow by 24 percent in 2013, on top of the 30 percent gain seen in 2012. In its third-quarter earnings statement, Nordstrom said its off-price Rack stores have contributed 23 percent of the company's net sales so far this year, and it plans to open roughly 30 more locations in 2014. Coach will also increase its already heavy off-price presence by opening 20 new factory units in 2014. Already, Wells Fargo analyst Paul Lejuez estimates that four out of five Coach handbags sold at U.S. retail come out of a factory outlet, he said. Off-pricers such as TJ Maxx provide another opportunity for bargain hunters, as do H&M's designer collaborations, which most recently drew a crowd for its tie-up with French runway designer Isabel Marant. TJ Maxx parent company TJX has been listed as a top pick this holiday by analysts, including Stifel Nicolaus' Richard Jaffe, who cited its compelling assortment and value. People are aspirational in terms of the brands they want to own and wear , but I think they are as particular as ever in terms of really requiring a discount and really waiting for sale periods to make those purchases, said Lejuez. (Read more: Holiday study highlights US wealth gap) Accenture's Jacobson said there has been a generational shift among today's young shoppers , who have come to be conditioned for the rebate , or discount, or financing. This shift will last much longer than the luxury items they buy , and will have long-term implications on the segment, he said. It's the [question of] luxury or the egg? he said. Did the access come first , or did your need come first? The both seem to coexist well. On the flip side , higher-tier brands are also doing a better job of reaching the aspirational consumer through social media and advertisements, which position pricier items, such as apparel, next to their lower-ticket products, such as sunglasses, A.T. Kearney's Ben-Shabat said. Online revolution is slowly taking hold Another way aspirational shoppers have evolved is in their desire to shop online. The personal luxury goods market is expected to grow its online sales by 28 percent in 2013, on top of last year's 33 percent gain, according to Bain. The off-price market makes up nearly a third of this segment, including flash-sale sites such as Gilt Groupe. Gilt CEO Michelle Peluso told CNBC that its Black Friday weekend sales were phenomenal in 2013 , rising 45 percent on the year. Some have speculated that Gilt, along with online home goods discounter One Kings Lane, will go public, but Peluso said the company is not in any rush. What's more, Nordstrom's flash-sale site, HauteLook, has seen same-store sales rise by more than 25 percent this year, boasting nearly 15 million members. Still, there is much more room for luxury to grow in the online space. According to Bain, 40 percent of high-end brands still do not sell online, which can be a major disadvantage to brands looking to recruit new customers. (Read more: Let it snow!

It's a much tailored experience for the merchant , he said. Experts agree that those companies who meet consumers' needs will be the ones who succeed in bringing back the aspirational shopper.

State and city officials said Tuesday they are seeking developers for a 5.5-acre parcel of land along Kneeland Street near the Southeast Expressway that is now home to an office building for the Massachusetts Department of Transportation and the Veolia steam plant. It 2019s the highest-profile parcel yet to be marketed in a new push by the Baker administration to put state-owned sites into the hands of private developers. And sitting near the Financial District, a block from South Station and alongside highway off-ramps for Interstate 93 and the Massachusetts Turnpike, it 2019s a prime spot for a major development. Secretary of Transportation Stephanie Pollack, with Governor Charlie Baker (left) and Boston Mayor Martin Walsh, behind her, discussed the plan at a news conference on Tuesday. 201cThis is something I believe has tremendous potential, 201d Governor Charlie Baker said at a news conference Tuesday announcing the plan. The state and city of Boston will launch a series of community meetings next month to gather input from neighborhood groups. They 2019ll use that information to help craft a request for proposals that will be used to select a developer. Any plan would need to incorporate the Veolia steam plant, which provides heating and cooling to many downtown office building. The plant must be taken down and a replacement steam facility built underneath the new buildings. Meanwhile MassDOT would either get offices inside the new development or relocate. City and state officials said the Veolia site 2014 which runs along Kneeland Street between Albany Street and the I-93 off-ramp alongside South Station 2014 could house 1.5 million to 2 million square feet of new development, including housing, offices, and open space. 201cThis is fundamentally a blank canvas, 201d said Brian Golden, director of the Boston Redevelopment Authority. 201cWe 2019re anticipating great things occurring here. 201d The focus at Tuesday 2019s announcement was on housing. Mayor Martin Walsh and his housing chief Sheila Dillon both spoke about the need for more housing for lower- and middle-income Boston residents, and the rare opportunity to guide development of such a big parcel of land in the heart of the city. 201cBoston is just 48 square miles, which makes building lots of housing that much harder, 201d Dillon said. 201cOur land resources are finite, which is why this is so important. 201d Housing has also been a priority for neighborhood groups in Chinatown, which will have a voice in designing the request for proposals. A similar process a decade ago on a state-owned parcel nearby on Kneeland Street resulted in a new apartment development, known as One Greenway, that set aside 40 percent of its units at affordable rents 2014 more than three times the typical set-aside in Boston. Both the market-rate and affordable apartments opened last year, while a second building of affordably-priced condos is expected to break ground this spring. Angie Liou, acting executive director of the Asian Community Development Corp., said Chinatown housing advocates will take an active role in deciding what goes on the Veolia site. 201cWhenever they have these meetings, we 2019ll be there, 201d she said. Whether for housing or job-creating activities or open space, many underused state-owned properties could 2014 and should 2014 be repurposed, Baker said. The state is the biggest property owner in Massachusetts, and Baker said too much of it sits vacant, or in this case not used to its fullest potential. The governor is pledging to make hundreds of state-owned properties easier to acquire, and build on. 201cIt makes me crazy when I look out and see all these sites, 201d Baker said. 201cIt 2019s a big missed opportunity. 201d An aerial view of the property, which is marked in red.

   "input": "Angela Wrightson suffered more than 100 injuries. Two teenage girls who took selfies as they beat a vulnerable British woman to death before phoning police to ask for a lift home have been jailed for life. The pair, aged 13 and 14 at the time of the murder, battered frail Angela Wrightson over five hours in her own home with household items including a shovel, a coffee table and a television set, eventually leaving her for dead. The rare case -- and the young age of the killers -- has sparked comparisons with the 1993 murder of toddler Jamie Bulger by two 10-year-old boys. Almost 400 children under the age of 18 have reportedly been convicted of murder in Britain over the past two decades. Sentencing the girls yesterday, judge Henry Globe called the crime a cowardly attack that involved gratuitous degradation. Wrightson ,39, was found with more than 100 injuries in her blood-spattered living room in the industrial town of Hartlepool in northeastern England. This was a sustained attack over a long period of time carried out with weapons in many different ways , the judge told the girls , both now 15. Pathology evidence revealed an absolute minimum of 70 separate slash injuries , 54 separate blunt force injuries and wounds to the victim's hands, wrists and arms as she tried to deflect the blows. The seven-week trial heard that the girls, who came from troubled backgrounds, were frequent visitors to Wrightson's house and that she would often buy them alcohol and cigarettes. On the day of the attack, the pair let themselves into her home before restraining and torturing her. During the attack, one of them shared a picture on social media site Snapchat showing them smiling in front of their victim. One also talked to a friend over Facebook who overheard her say: Go on. Smash her head in. Bray (hit) her. The teens , who cannot be named due to their age, called the police at around 2 am in order to get a lift home. While in the van, they posted another photograph on Snapchat with the message: Me.... in the back , on the bizzie (police) van again. The judge at Leeds Crown Court summarised a statement from Wrightson's mother , Maureen, in which she described the horror of seeing Angie's battered body in the mortuary. She does not think she will ever be able to blink those images away , he said. She had been disgusted by the laughing and giggling and sharing of photographs. Prosecutor Gerry Wareham said the girls , who will serve a minimum of 15 years, had shown little remorse. The attack that the girls committed against Angela Wrightson was brutal and sustained. One can only imagine the fear and distress that she must have felt , he said. The case has revived memories of the Bulger killing. The little boy was abducted from a crowded shopping centre in Liverpool by 10-year-olds Jon Venables and Robert Thompson who took him to a nearby railway line where they tortured him and battered him to death. Venables and Thompson became the youngest convicted murderers in Britain for 250 years but were released on parole in 2001 after serving the minimum term of eight years. They have since started new lives under different identities.  ",

The stevia that has been used to sweeten the lemon-lime soft drink is now being switched out for high fructose corn syrup, Consumerist reports. This move has elicited big reactions from consumers, many of whom are saying that they will no longer buy the beverage. PepsiCo originally removed high fructose corn syrup from Sierra Mist in 2010 and replaced it with cane sugar. That allowed the company to market the drink as 201cnatural, 201d distinguishing it from other soft drinks on the market that are sweetened with corn syrup or artificial sweeteners and gaining the loyalty of customers who perceived it as a healthy alternative. It then modified the recipe to include stevia instead of cane sugar, but since stevia comes from a plant it was able to keep its 201cnatural 201d label. Now Sierra Mist is being rebranded as Mist TWST and will be sweetened with high fructose corn syrup again. This is an interesting decision, considering consumers are more concerned about what goes into their bodies today than they were six years ago.

Treasurer Scott Morrison has been in negotiation for several months with the crossbench about the new package cutting $4.8bn from family benefits, unveiled this week. Guardian Australia revealed Friday that innovation minister, Christopher Pyne, had told crossbench senators at a private meeting the government would only provide up to $200mn extra assistance for the car industry if the family benefit cuts passed the Senate. Related: Scott Morrison willing to sacrifice $3bn in family benefit cuts if senators agree Peter Chesworth, a division head with Pyne 2019s department of innovation and industry told senate estimates he had been in the meeting last week about car industry assistance and that the issue of cuts to family tax benefits 201cwas raised 201d although he 201ccouldn 2019t comment on the conditionality aspect. 201d Labor senator Kim Carr said he regarded linking the family benefit cuts with extra assistance for the car industry as being a 201cblackmail proposition 201d. New figures show that single parents who earn less than $100,000 a year and have teenage children make up the biggest group of losers under new cuts, which the federal government is describing as being like a game of 201csnakes and ladders 201d. The new cuts, which save the budget $4.8bn over four years, remove family tax benefits worth $2,737 a year from single income families when their youngest turns 13 and reduces the payment to $1,000 for sole parents of teenagers and grandparents caring for teenagers. The human services minister, Christian Porter, says the aim is to try to get single parents and stay at home parents back into the workforce. Senate estimates heard the changes to the family tax benefit B payments 2013 available to families earning up to $100,000 2013 would hit 136,000 single parents in the first year, as well as 76,000 single income couples and 3,900 grandparent carers. The same families will also lose around $900 per child in end of year benefits. Porter said the cuts were like the 201csnakes 201d in a game of snakes and ladders 2013 with the small increase in general family payments and the proposed $3.5bn childcare package being the 201cladders 201d. That childcare package 2013 announced in the 2015 budget but not yet legislated and scheduled to come into effect in 2017 2013 gives higher benefits right up the income scale, paying 85% of childcare costs for families earning up to $65,000 and 50% for those earning over $170,000. These payments are uncapped until family income reaches $185,000 and then the proposed cap is higher than the one that applies now - rising to $10,000 per child from $7,500. Related: Crossbench seek sweeteners for supporting revised family benefit cuts 201cIn the measures that we have put before parliament there are snakes and there are ladders but there are a lot of ladders in the package, 201d Porter told Sky news. 201cWe 2019re not saving as much as the first iteration of this package and that 2019s because we are giving a lot back to people. But, ultimately, the package is about trying to devise ways to increase female workforce participation amongst mums, single mothers, mothers in couple families, 201d he said. 201cWhen your child turns thirteen, having had the benefit of a childcare package up to that point, you should be moving back into greater workforce participation. 201d The new package replaces 2014 budget measures that had been stalled in the Senate, which would have saved $8.5bn according to the parliamentary budget office. It remains unclear whether the government will get the new package through the senate. Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie says she is unlikely to vote for it. Senators Glenn Lazarus, Dio Wang, John Madigan, Ricky Muir, Bob Day and Nick Xenophon are all undecided. Liberal Democrat senator David Leyonhjelm supports the changes.  ",

The authorities described the accident as a horrendous crash. The 33,000-pound truck struck the passenger side of the police car at 3:37 a.m. at Bay Ridge Parkway and 18th Avenue in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. The truck driver, Jacques Lavache,38, was thrown from the cab. He was pronounced dead at Lutheran Medical Center. The authorities said the truck barreled on after the collision, pushing the police cruiser over the curb and crushing it against the wall of the New Way Supermarket. Two police officers -- David Regan,27, and Kenneth Waszak, 34 -- were trapped inside the car. An Emergency Service Unit removed them from the wreckage, but Officer Regan, who was in the front passenger seat, was pronounced dead at Maimonides Medical Center. Officer Waszak, the driver, suffered internal bleeding and a fractured spine. He was listed in serious condition at Lutheran Medical Center. Capt. June Martucci, a police spokeswoman, said he was expected to recover. ''As of now, they said he is not going to be paralyzed,'' she said. ''But they said he is going to be hospitalized for a while.'' Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who offered condolences to Officer Regan's parents at the hospital, said he reviewed pictures of the accident. ''It was one of the worst impacts I have ever seen,'' he said. No citations were issued after the crash. The authorities said Mr. Lavache, of the Clinton Hill section of Brooklyn, had a valid driver's license and the truck appeared to have no mechanical defects or safety problems. The cruiser's flashing lights and siren were on before it entered the intersection, they said. It was not clear whether the truck had a green light as it drove through the intersection. The police said the matter was being investigated, as was the reason for the 911 call reporting gunfire. No evidence of gunfire was found, the police said. Mr. Lavache was the father of a newborn, the police said. Formerly a longtime driver for The Daily News, he had recently been working part time for The Post. Mr. Lavache's phone number is unpublished, and efforts to reach his family were unsuccessful. Ken Chandler, the publisher of The New York Post, issued a statement. ''This was a tragic accident,'' he said. ''Our sympathies go to the families and we hope the injured policeman recovers quickly.'' Officers Regan and Waszak both joined the department in the fall of 1998. They were classmates at the Police Academy and were assigned to night tours on patrol in the 62nd Precinct. The authorities said Officer Regan, who lived in Garden City, N.Y., would have turned 28 on Thursday and planned to ask his girlfriend to marry him when she visited him from Texas next weekend. Officer Regan had recently told the department that he would leave his job this summer to move to Texas, and he had begun packing for the move, said Chief Christopher T. Austin of the Garden City Park Volunteer Fire Department, in which Officer Regan served as a lieutenant. Chief Austin, who is also a New York City police officer, said Officer Regan wore badge 102 -- the number that was on his grandfather's shield when he served in the same fire department years ago -- on both his police and fire uniforms. ''He was always there for us with whatever we needed,'' the chief said. ''The guys are taking it rough.''

   "input": "DESPITE HIS thick glasses, rumpled jacket, a tie that barely reaches past his sternum and the obligatory chalk-covered pants of a professor, he cuts a handsome figure. Striding across the room in long, sure steps, he conducts his lecture like a maestro, the rat-a-tat-tat of the chalk on the board providing a counterpoint to his high, breathy, sometimes inaudible voice. He talks of ''vector bundles,'' ''spin groups,'' ''Dirac operators,'' ''connected Lie groups,'' ''trivial modules,'' ''free loop spaces.'' At one point he pauses: ''We've been living in a finite dimensional world. Now I'm inviting you to jump into a world of infinite dimension.'' He is Edward Witten of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J. At the age of 36, he is among the foremost physicists of his day, and he is in New York lecturing the Columbia University mathematics department on, of all things, the applications of physics to mathematics. Math - which has to do with abstract, intangible relationships - has always been an important tool in physics - which has to do with concrete forces and objects in the actual world. Witten has turned things upside down, attempting to show how physics can provide new insights into math. Turning things upside down is something he seems to do as a matter of course. ''We shouldn't toss comparisons with Einstein around too freely,'' says Sam B. Treiman, a member of the physics department at Princeton, ''but when it comes to Witten. . . .'' His hands open in a gesture of helplessness. ''He's head and shoulders above the rest. He's started whole groups of people on new paths. He's started whole new fields. He produces elegant, breathtaking proofs which people gasp at, which leave them in awe.'' Harvard physicist Sidney Coleman calls Witten, simply, ''smarter than anyone else. He's brought light where there was darkness. Everything he does is golden. If you go to any theoretical physics department in the world, you can see that people are touched, and touched deeply, by Ed's work.'' Witten is everywhere at once, publishing papers and lecturing on cosmology, mathematics and many different aspects of physics. When Witten talks, physicists listen. In particular, they perked up their ears several years ago when he began to pay serious attention to a seemingly bizarre and long-forgotten theory that turns our current picture of the physical universe on its head. Although it is nearly impossible to put a finger on the single contribution that has made Witten such a force in physics, his passion for this controversial theory makes him a leading proponent of what may be the most revolutionary idea in physics in more than half a century - as revolutionary, claims Witten, as relativity; as revolutionary as quantum theory. If the theory is right, as Witten believes it may ultimately prove to be, it could provide entirely new answers to fundamental questions asked by philosophers, poets and theologians since the beginning of human time: Why is the universe the way it is and what is the origin of matter? (Box, page 24.) Although the term makes Witten uncomfortable, some people call it a ''theory of everything.'' ''String theory,'' as it is commonly known (some scientists call it ''superstring theory''), does away with the familiar image of a universe composed of billiard-ball-like particles pushed and pulled by familiar forces like gravity and electricity. Quantum theory had already revealed in the 1920's that the billiard balls have curious wave-like properties: they are more like vibrations than well-defined points in space. Now string theory is proposing that these points, in fact, are tiny loops, or closed ''strings,'' that the universe is built not of Grape-Nuts but of Cheerios. The strings, too, vibrate invisibly in subtle resonances. These vibrations, so the theory goes, make up everything in the universe - from light to lightning bugs, from gravity to gold. These strings are not, of course, visible, nor are they like rubber bands or pieces of twine. Impossible to detect by any means known to science today, they are mathematical curves. Talking about strings, like talking about billiard balls or waves, is a crude way of trying to comprehend the unfamiliar in familiar terms. But then, physics has always had to resort to metaphor. As the late Niels Bohr, the father of quantum theory, once put it, ''When it comes to atoms, language can be used only as in poetry. The poet, too, is not nearly so concerned with describing facts as with creating images.'' Previous scientific theories describing the universe have not yet been able to create an image that fits all the pieces of the universe together within a single conceptual framework. Physicists have opened the atom, like a series of Russian dolls, to reveal, first, electrons, protons and neutrons - then, more exotic entities like neutrinos and quarks. They have learned how nuclear, gravitational and electromagnetic forces mold these particles into molecules and galaxies. But nobody knows why, among other things, there should be electrons at all, or why particles are affected by gravity. String theory, according to its adherents, has the potential of offering a single consistent explanation for everything from the inner workings of the atom to the structure of the cosmos.  ",

Postings for work-at-home management jobs, including marketing and sales managers, are the fastest-growing category, based on an internal analysis of postings on Indeed.com. This reflects an overall trend toward more hiring of skilled telecommuters, says Paul Wolfe, senior vice president, human resources, for the job board. About 30% of all U.S. work-from-home postings are for computer and math-related jobs, followed by management jobs at 16.2% and health-care jobs at 15.9%, he says.

   "input": "RISHON LEZION, Israel 2014 The scam had all the trappings of a major con. Working from a dingy office building just a short drive from the glittering Mediterranean Sea, eight immigrants from Europe formed an unlikely team that allegedly conspired to dupe major multinational companies out of millions of dollars. Most of them spoke French, the others Italian. Using their language skills and familiarity with European business practices, they telephoned employees at some of Europe 2019s biggest companies, identified themselves as top executives and tricked workers into transferring large sums of money to bank accounts in their control, police said. Among the companies targeted, according to police and suspects 2019 lawyers: Kia Motors, Hugo Boss, and Chanel. It was a classic 2018 2018fake CEO 2019 2019 or 2018 2018fake president 2019 2019 scam, a scheme used by various criminals worldwide that has robbed companies of some $1.8 billion in just over two years, according to the FBI. Most of the eight suspects in the latest case are either jailed or under house arrest. But not the man who boasts of pioneering the scam years ago, inspiring copycats like these around the globe: French-Israeli con artist Gilbert Chikli. He mysteriously remains a free man, living in luxury in his villa in a seaside Israeli city as French authorities try to bring him to justice over a massive con for which he was previously convicted. 2018 2018If they have a problem, they can come see me. They know my address. I am not fleeing, 2019 2019 Chikli said by telephone. 2018 2018Send them my regards. 2019 2019 The case illustrates how financial crime has globalized faster and more efficiently than the law enforcement that is trying to fight it. Israel extradited Chikli to France to stand trial in 2008 for defrauding HSBC, Thomson, Accenture, and other companies out of 6.1 million euros ($6.9 million), and attempting to extract more than 70 million euros ($79.5 million) from at least 33 others. But in 2009, Chikli says he chartered a private plane and flew back to Israel. A French court in May 2015 sentenced him in absentia to seven years in prison. Instead, he 2019s been sipping coffee at a portside caf 00e9 in Israel and hanging out at his private swimming pool. France issued two requests to Israel for Chikli 2019s arrest, the French Justice Ministry said. The first request came the year after he escaped prosecution in France. The second came this January, according to a copy of the Interpol notice. It was issued just two weeks after the release of a new heist-thriller film based on Chikli 2019s life story, starring Julie Gayet, the companion of French President Francois Hollande. Chikli 2019s wife, Shirly, attended the Paris premiere. Still, Israeli officials show no signs of going after Chikli, even as they prosecute his alleged copycats for similar crimes. Israel 2019s police and Justice Ministry declined to explain why, saying they do not discuss individual cases. France 2019s Justice Ministry said the Interpol notice issued against Chikli, called a 2018 2018diffusion, 2019 2019 is the equivalent of a provisional arrest warrant, with an aim to extradite a criminal to France. Interpol cannot force a country to comply with arrest notices and some countries routinely ignore them. Israeli Justice Ministry spokesman Noam Sharvit said Israel adheres to extradition requests when warranted. French Justice Ministry spokesman Olivier Pedro-Jose said Israeli-French cooperation on such cases comes with delays. 2018 2018The execution of requests for help from French officials by their Israeli counterparts often relate to extremely complex financial affairs, which demand long and considerable investigations, 2019 2019 he said. Irit Kohn, a former director of the Israeli Justice Ministry 2019s international department, said the countries 2019 differing legal systems have held up cooperation on criminal cases. Criminals, in contrast, have been far more nimble at running their cross-border activities, keeping a step ahead of the law. In the case of the eight immigrants in Israel, police began tracking them in November, secretly videotaping them from inside their office in an old building housing a car-repair shop in Netanya, a Mediterranean city north of Tel Aviv that is home to a large French immigrant community. On May 2, police raided the suspects 2019 office. Suspects tried to destroy computers and telephones, police say, in an effort to get rid of evidence.  ",

It 2019s a nuisance for bed partners, but researchers say we shouldn 2019t be so quick to write off snoring or other forms of disrupted breathing while asleep as mere annoyances; instead, they could be affecting the brain, according to new research. Snoring is a form of sleep apnea, in which people stop breathing for a few seconds or several minutes dozens of times in an hour. Any disruption of breathing during sleep can affect the brain, say researchers of a new study published in the journal Neurology. They found that people with sleep apnea tended to develop memory problems and other signs of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) earlier than people without such sleep disorders. MORE The Power of Sleep Ricardo Osorio, MD, research assistant professor of psychiatry at NYU Center for Brain Health, and his colleagues studied 2,000 people enrolled in the Alzheimer 2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 2014a population of 55 to 75 year olds, some of whom are cognitively normal, some who have mild cognitive impairment and others who have Alzheimer 2019s dementia. Everyone was asked about their snoring or sleep apnea, and researchers followed up every six months for two to three years to record any changes in their cognitive status. Those who reported having sleep apnea or snoring tended to develop signs of mild cognitive impairment, including memory lapses and slower speed on cognitive skills, about 12 years earlier on average than those who didn 2019t report any sleep-disordered breathing. Mild cognitive impairment often precedes Alzheimer 2019s dementia, but not all people who develop MCI go on to get Alzheimer 2019s. The connection between disrupted sleep breathing and MCI remained strong even after Osorio accounted for the effects of Alzheimer 2019s-related genes, gender, education, depression and heart disease risk factors, all of which have been associated with increased risk of cognitive decline. MORE Alzheimer 2019s Linked to Sleeping Pills and Anti-Anxiety Drugs Osorio also saw a connection between sleep apnea or snoring and Alzheimer 2019s dementia, but it wasn 2019t as robust as the link to MCI. That might be because other studies have found that not only are sleep disorders a risk factor for Alzheimer 2019s, but they are also a symptom of the degenerative brain disease 2014so those who already developed Alzheimer 2019s dementia may not have been accurately reporting their sleep habits. Osorio is careful not to implicate all snoring as a precursor to memory problems or Alzheimer 2019s. But particularly in the elderly, he says doctors should consider the potential effect that disrupted breathing during sleep can have on the brain. While it 2019s not clear how sleep disorders might be increasing the risk of MCI or Alzheimer 2019s, it 2019s possible that the cumulate effects of even the short periods when the person isn 2019t breathing could deprive brain neurons of critical oxygen, and Alzheimer 2019s has been linked to slower or abnormal blood flow caused by hypertension and high cholesterol levels. Other studies have also shown that the protein responsible for Alzheimer 2019s, amyloid, tends to build up during the day when the nerves are active and decline at night during deep sleep. If people are being roused from deep sleep by their apnea or snoring, then they aren 2019t enjoying prolonged periods of low amyloid production, so the substance can build up and potentially form plaques. MORE Here 2019s How Much Experts Think You Should Sleep Every Night Osorio also found that it 2019s possible to counteract some of the effects of sleep apnea or snoring. He also studied people who used a device to prevent apnea, known as a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine, which keeps airways open during sleep. Even though they snored or had sleep apnea, people who used the device developed MCI or Alzheimer 2019s at the same rate as those who didn 2019t have these sleep problems. CPAP machines are cumbersome and uncomfortable to use, and many people drop them after a few weeks. But, says Osorio, they may have more reason to stick with them now. 201cA lot of people don 2019t use them because they see no benefits, 201d he says, 201cbut if they know it can improve their memory, they may definitely try to do better. 201d Read next: 7 Signs You 2019re Not Getting Enough Sleep Listen to the most important stories of the day.

The former journalist was suspended without pay on 19 April after being accused of serious misconduct. Hirst told Guardian Australia he was disappointed and saddened by the university 2019s decision and denied threatening a student in one of the tweets.

The exchange came about after the News Corp columnist Rita Panahi said Hirst was a 201crent-seeking simpleton full of bitterness & bile 201d after he called her unstable. McDougall replied: 201cI 2019m glad I 2019m a commerce student and not subject to this man 2019s [Hirst 2019s] stewardship. 201d Hirst argued in his formal response to the allegations that he was not threatening McDougall in the tweet but was merely questioning his intelligence, and he didn 2019t realise McDougall was a student at Deakin at the time. The university disagreed and said the tweet would be interpreted by a reasonable person as a threat to the academic progress of McDougall. After an investigation the university identified two other tweets and accused Hirst of breaching the code of conduct for academics. The second tweet contained a photo of a knitted beanie on which the words 201cfuck it 201d are printed, with the caption: 201cBack to work after the Easter break? You need this beanie.

   "input": "The job search is kind of a touchy subject for Garett Bonk and his peers. The Crown Point, Ind., native nailed down a job with elder-law firm Delaney, Delaney & Voorn earlier this year, but not all of his peers at The John Marshall Law School can say the same. So they just don't talk about it. It's not that job hunting is particularly rough for this spring's crop of law school grads 2014 it's just ultracompetitive, said Bonk. The job market for students getting their law degrees and MBAs has steadily improved since it bottomed out during the recession, experts say, but finding work after the intense, expensive years in graduate and professional school is still no walk in the park. It won't be known for a year how 2016 graduates were hired and in what fields. But industry watchers say the job market is stable and steady for graduates with advanced degrees. It's been an uphill climb for those grads since the job market dried up in the depths of the recession. On-campus recruiting tanked in 2009 but started showing signs of improvement in 2011 and has continued to climb every year since, according to Megan Hendricks, executive director of the MBA Career Services & Employer Alliance. Based on our most recent recruiting trends survey as well as anecdotal information from our members , we expect to see a steady increase in recruiting in 2016, said Hendricks. Three out of four employers said they expect to hire MBA graduates in 2016 and 85 percent of that group plans to hire as many or more of these candidates as they did in 2015 , according to a poll of employers conducted late last year by the Graduate Management Admission Council. Like the market for MBAs, recruitment of law school graduates to law firms and corporate America vanished in 2009. It's been one step forward , two steps back since then, said James Leipold , executive director of the National Association for Law Placement. Take, for example, firms making job offers after callback interviews, Leipold said. Before the recession, 60 percent of firms typically made offers, but it plunged to 37 percent in 2009. Only in the last three years has it been steadily on the rise again. Last year, 54 percent of firms made job offers after callbacks, Leipold said. Prospects also have gotten brighter because there are fewer law school graduates at a time of increased recruiting, according to Leipold. Earlier this year, the association reported 95.3 percent of 2015 summer associates 2014 who will graduate this spring 2014 received an entry-level law associate position offer, up from 93.4 percent last year. That's in stark contrast to 2009, when only 69 percent of summer associates received offers. About half of law grads wind up at law firms. For the other half, hiring is also challenging, competitive and improving in other sectors, except in the public sector where funding is limited and positions are scarce, experts say. If law firms brought on 100 summer associates a generation ago, these days the class size is a fraction of that, meaning increasing numbers of new lawyers are looking for jobs in burgeoning fields such as compliance, legal technology and even at legal outsourcing firms. There will be a lot of new roles for lawyers that may not be in the traditional practice of law , said Bill Chamberlain , assistant dean and director for law career services at DePaul University College of Law. We'll see more and more people being hired in heavily regulated industries , he said. Despite the changing face of the industry , it looks like it'll be as good as last year if not slightly better , Chamberlain said. That's good news for Bonk ,27, and his peers who entered law school in August 2013, when the economy was still recovering from its recession-era wounds. It was tough to find a job with an undergraduate degree in 2012, so when he entered law school in Chicago that same year 2014 in a city chock full of wanna-be lawyers, including those at two of the nation's top law schools 2014 he expected a lot of competition. By the time I graduated I knew it would be very competitive in Chicago , given the number of law schools, he said. Chicago is a major city that's attractive to students from all over the country. So Bonk focused on the growing field of elder law in hopes giving himself an edge. He also developed a career plan and worked with the career services office at John Marshall. The strongest thing I did was network and practice mock interviews , he said. His strategy worked , since he found the internship during his second year of law school at Delaney, Delaney & Voorn. Last fall, Bonk began looking for jobs because he wasn't sure Delaney would hire him full-time. He set up casual coffees with contacts. Some of those turned into lunch dates. I don't think they would have been as receptive when the economy was rougher. Now there's less pressure , Bonk said. Three interviews with potential employers followed. Then the job offer from Delaney arrived in early March. In the back of mind I had a sense of urgency , Bonk said. Hussam Bachour has also found the job search to be a lot smoother than expected. Bachour ,30, will complete his master's degree in supply chain management this month and his MBA from Loyola University Chicago's Quinlan School of Business later this year. He's had several interviews, a few offers and is weighing the opportunity that most closely aligns with my career aspirations , he said.

   "input": "Andrew Ng, chief scientist at Chinese Web giant Baidu, isn 2019t concerned about the idea of killer robots. But he does foresee advanced robotics using artificial intelligence taking people 2019s jobs. Speaking at the Structure Data conference in San Francisco on Wednesday, Ng said, 201cWorrying about killer robots today is like worrying about overpopulation on Mars. 201d While he admits some day it 2019s possible that robots might be intelligent enough for us to worry about them killing people, they aren 2019t even close to capable today. 201cI don 2019t object to people starting committees to study this, but I don 2019t want to be on it, 201d he said. Instead, Ng is thinking about the short-term effect of greater access to deep learning, which is currently being applied to things such as identifying images, understanding speech, and improving things like web search or advertisement engagement. Ng also anticipates the advantages of deep learning to make their way into areas like farming, reading medical images and other industries where the use of AI and robots will replace jobs. 201cIt will replace jobs in the next couple of years, 201d Ng predicted. He added that we have seen the impact of technology replacing jobs throughout history, and he anticipates a painful middle area where people will need to be retrained. To mitigate this rapid fire shift in jobs, Ng suggested implementing some type of basic income in which the government pays a living wage to people. 201cHowever, I 2019m not sure the U.S. is ready for a basic income, so something like paying people to study, might work better, 201d Ng explained in an interview after his talk. Others in Silicon Valley have also echoed the call for some type of basic income. Last year, Zipcar CEO Robin Chase called for some type of basic income as she worried about the impact of technology on jobs. Finland and Switzerland have proposed some type of basic income program while Ontario, Canada is testing its own policy. Despite the potential for job losses, Ng is optimistic about the overall changes to society that will come from investing in artificial intelligence. From the hope of safer roads thanks to self-driving cars to real-time translations, the impacts of AI will be felt everywhere. Furthermore, AI is making money for businesses already. Ng cited Baidu bidu generates huge amounts of revenue from better search powered by deep learning and better ads delivered. Get Data Sheet, Fortune 2019s technology newsletter. Even Google goog is turning to deep learning to improve its own search results. Ng reflected these sorts of changes are only near-term benefits driven by supervised learning in which the computer is given an item and must make a prediction. For example, showing the computer an image and having it identify the objects or people depicted. Another instance could be presenting the computer with an email and having the system decide if it 2019s spam or not. Those supervised learning advances are being applied today, but research into other types of learning, such as the types of artificial intelligence that led to Google 2019s algorithms beating Go on Tuesday night, are coming. Those should be even more powerful. But in order to take advantage of them, we will have to build new infrastructures first. Some sort of safety net for displaced jobs is part of the equation, but other priorities such as rethinking transportation infrastructure to account for self-driving cars is another. Ng offered the example of a self-driving car meeting a worker in a construction zone as an example. Today, with a human driving the car, a construction worker simply holds up his hand to stop the car and then motions it forward. To better serve self-driving cars, society will have to adapt to keep the construction worker safe. Ng suggested the worker would have a Wi-Fi beacon or some other machine-readable object to communicate with the self-driving car. Yes, building that type of high-tech infrastructure into a roads, signage, and traffic cops is a big task. But the Department of Transportation is already mulling over standards to implement, such as vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication. Forcing a self-driving car to interact with humans in the same way human drivers interact with humans would be impractical. But building an infrastructure where both AI and humans can work together is what Ng hopes can happen. It 2019s no surprise he doesn 2019t have time to worry about killer robots.  ",

   "input": "Any Apple fan knows that the company 2019s keynotes aren 2019t just about the products being unveiled 2014 it 2019s about the way Apple does it. Apple 2019s late co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs had a reputation for captivating the audience during big events and announcements. The phrase 201cone more thing 201d became famous because of Jobs 2019 tenancy to surprise the crowd with another announcement after the keynote was expected to be over. Here 2019s a look at some of the greatest moments Apple has had on stage so far. Jobs returned to Apple in 1997 after being fired by the board in 1985, and it was a huge moment for the company. Apple was in trouble 2014 the Mac was tanking and the company was on the cusp of bankruptcy. You could tell just by the crowd 2019s energy that Job 2019s return to Apple seemed to indicate that a big change was about to come. Jobs introduced the first iMac by pointing out all of the issues with computers that were current at the time in 1998 2014 a lot of them were slow, ugly, and difficult to use. That 2019s why the original iMac was pitched as the first truly user-friendly computer. The translucent colorful design is still memorable today. At an event in 1999, Jobs showcased the iBook 2019s Wi-Fi capabilities by picking it up and moving it while he was still browsing the web. That 2019s an every day task in today 2019s world, but about 16 years ago it seemed like magic. The iPod was nothing short of a groundbreaking device 2014 one that 2019s largely responsible for the shift from CD players to MP3 players to storing music on our phones like we do today. The crowd was pretty silent when Jobs initially introduced the iPod and explained what it does. But when he pulled the device out of his pocket and showed the world what it looked like, the crowd erupted in cheer. When Jobs announced the first iPhone, he initially made it sound like Apple was going to announce three new devices: 201cAn iPod 2026a phone 2026and an internet communicator. 201d He then showcased the iPhone, which he pitched as all three gadgets rolled up into one device. The audience loved it. After Jobs officially took the wraps off the new phone, he famously prank called Starbucks and asked for 4,000 lattes to go. The demo was meant to show how easy it is to find a specific location on a map and then call that place seamlessly using the new iPhone. 201cJust kidding, wrong number! 201d he said after the crowd laughed and applauded. The unveiling of the iPad itself wasn 2019t too much of a surprise 2014 as is the case with tech news cycles today, many had speculated back in 2010 that Apple was indeed working on a tablet computer. But many had expected the iPad to cost around $1,0, which is why it was a bit of a shock when Jobs revealed that the starting price was actually $499. Jobs loved to tease specific demos, products, and announcements that he was particularly proud of by saving them for last and telling the crowd there was 201cone more thing 201d he had to show them. One of the most memorable of these was when he demoed FaceTime for the first time on the iPhone 4 by calling Jony Ive back in 2010. Back then, the ability to have clear face-to-face phone calls that worked seamlessly was a game changer. 201cIt 2019s in Apple 2019s DNA that technology alone is not enough, 201d Jobs said on stage when Apple unveiled the second iPad in March 2011. 201cThat it 2019s technology married with liberal arts married with the humanities that yields us the result that makes our hearts sing. 201d The image became iconic because it sums up Apple 2019s values so well. It 2019s not all about how powerful the technology is 2014 it 2019s about how simple and easy it is to use. The Apple Watch was the first new product category that Apple has unveiled since Jobs 2019 passing in 2011, and Cook introduced the device with Jobs 2019 own famous catch phrase. The unveiling was also significant because the watch had been anticipated for more than a year before its official introduction. Although it wasn 2019t surprising to learn that Apple had been working on a watch, no one had known what it would be called or what it would look like until last year 2019s keynote in September 2014. When Apple bought Beats Electronics for $3 billion last year, Dr. Dre and renowned record executive Jimmy Iovine were brought on as official Apple employees. They 2019re titles at Apple are simply 201cJimmy and Dre, 201d according to The Wall Street Journal. This article originally appeared on Business Insider.  ",

   "input": "As it prepares to spin off PayPal over the summer, eBay reported stronger than expected first quarter earnings Wednesday thanks to its growing payments business. But eBay 2019s marketplace is declining, which doesn 2019t bode well for its success after saying goodbye to PayPal. Indeed, the report hammered home the divergent trajectories of the two businesses in one nugget of data. PayPal, the one-time upstart in the corporate family, has finally eclipsed eBay 2019s marketplace in revenue. Sales in EBay 2019s bazaar of antique vases, used cars and outlet clothing fell 4% to $2 billion. Meanwhile, PayPal 2019s revenue grew 14% to $2.1 billion, slightly edging out its sister division. The payments arm has long been the fastest growing business for eBay. The core marketplace business was still growing, although at a slower rate than PayPal. But while digital and mobile payments take off, the marketplace business has recently floundered amid stiff competition from Amazon and others. The changing of the guard was inevitable. In anticipation and under pressure from investor Carl Icahn, eBay decided to spin-off PayPal, the company it acquired more than a decade ago. CEO John Donahoe explained that the once-symbiotic relationship between the two divisions wasn 2019t as tight as it used to be and that they could do better alone while focusing on their respective businesses. While all signs point to PayPal emerging from the spinoff as a healthy company, it will likely be a different story for eBay. Without PayPal, eBay would merely be a slow-growth business at best and a possible acquisition target, and a possible acquisition target of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba could be an interested buyer as it looks to expand to the U.S. Short term, however, Devin Wenig, the future CEO of eBay 2019s marketplace business, mentioned another challenge for eBay 2019s marketplace. Recent changes by Google to its search algorithm has negatively impacted product listings in results and that eBay is looking to fix the problem. Thankfully for eBay, it doesn 2019t look like the company will face competition from PayPal anytime soon. Earlier this month, the company revealed additional terms of the split, with eBay and PayPal entering into a deal that prohibits them from competing against each other after they 2019ve parted ways. PayPal is blocked from creating its own marketplace for physical goods, while eBay has promised to steer clear of building a payments system. As part of the agreement, the two companies will share data around payment risk and security. In prelude to the split, eBay and PayPal still report their earnings as a combined company. Its overall quarterly revenue increased 4% from a year earlier to $4.45 billion, in line with analyst expectations. Profits excluding certain expenses came in at $943 million or 77 cents per share, slightly higher than the 70 cents that analysts had predicted. EBay 2019s core marketplace quarterly revenue declined for first quarterly decline since 2009. Gross merchandise volume for fell 2% to $20.1 billion. International volume, which was always touted as a huge growth opportunity for eBay, was down 4% in the quarter. As expected, PayPal had a strong quarter in which payment volume rose 18% to $61 billion and the number of transactions grew 24% to over 1 billion. Mobile payments through PayPal are up 40% year-over-year and now represent 30% of all transactions. PayPal isn 2019t immune from competition either, especially on mobile, with Apple Pay, fast growing payments unicorn Stripe, Google and others all vying to power payments for consumers. We 2019ll see how Wall Street values both PayPal and eBay in the coming months. This article originally appeared on Fortune.com  ",

   "input": "The federal government brands magnets in toys a deadly hazard to children because the tiny, powerful objects can fall out and cause serious, even fatal, internal injuries when swallowed. Yet the Consumer Product Safety Commission has not taken steps to regulate even more powerful magnets when they are sold in loose form as backings on children's earrings, the Tribune has found. The earrings consist of a small decorative part -- such as a cupcake, a faux diamond, a dolphin -- with a magnet inside. They are held in place by putting a loose magnet behind the earlobe. Independent tests of more than a dozen magnetic earrings done for the Tribune showed that the earring magnets all were at least as powerful as magnets found inside toys that have caused the death of one child and scores of other injuries. Some of the magnetic earrings were more than five times more powerful. But because the earrings are not considered toys, new regulations for magnets do not apply. If they did, the jewelry could not be legally sold, according to a CPSC spokesman, Scott Wolfson. The Tribune found reports of more than two dozen instances in the U.S. and Europe in recent years where magnets from earrings have been swallowed, aspirated into the lungs or become stuck together on either side of a child's nose cartilage. Those youngsters had used the earrings to mimic nose, tongue and even navel piercings. Most of these injuries did not result in hospitalizations. But, given the precedent of serious injuries caused by magnets in toys, some leading physicians are wondering why the CPSC is not taking action anyway. It's clear what the risks of magnets are , said Dr. Garry Gardner , a physician from suburban Darien who is chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics' committee on injury, violence and poison prevention. I don't care whether they call it a toy or not , these are still a risk. Any magnet that can be aspirated or swallowed is dangerous. But the CPSC says it has not received enough reports of injuries linked to magnets in jewelry to warrant further action at this time. The agency's national injury database shows there were seven such incidents from 2002 to 2004 and none in the following two years. (Data for 2007 are unavailable.) One incident in 2003 required the child , a 2-year-old boy, to be hospitalized. The number of incidents compared to the number of products is very low , said Julie Vallese , spokeswoman for the CPSC. The known risk has not risen to a substantial product hazard. But even a toy industry official expressed concern about the jewelry. We should not have to wait for catastrophic incidents to address it , said Arthur Kazianis , vice president of quality assurance for Hasbro Inc. and the head of a private panel that is developing standards for magnets in toys. For years the CPSC had received reports of children injured after swallowing magnets that fell out of toys, but not until a child died in 2005 after ingesting magnets from a Magnetix building set did the agency move to recall the product and push for tougher standards. Following a Tribune investigation of Magnetix and the agency's slow response, published in May, the CPSC expanded its recall and in August added magnets as No. 1 on its list of top five home hazards. Its news release noted that such magnets can be very small and powerful making them popular in toys , building sets, and jewelry. But that's as far as the agency has gone to address magnetic jewelry. In that release , the CPSC also noted that injuries from ingesting magnets are hard to diagnose. Parents and physicians may think that the materials will pass through the child without consequence , but magnets can attract in the body and twist or pinch the intestines, causing holes, blockages, infection, and death, if not treated properly and promptly. Doctor: 'It is a hazard' Dr. Marsha Kay , a pediatric gastroenterologist at The Cleveland Clinic who has written about the dangers of magnets, said she considers magnetic earrings to be as big a threat to child safety as magnets in toys. These things are marketed for kids , and it is a hazard, she said. How many kids have to get hurt before someone pays attention to it? Just as with magnetic toys , Kay said, a danger is that older children will play with the product and leave behind magnets that younger children can swallow. A new industry standard taking effect next month calls for warning labels on toys that include magnets and are small enough to be swallowed. Already, many magnetic toys include warnings about the danger of internal injuries. In addition, the new standard requires all toys with magnets to undergo tests to ensure the magnets won't fall out with regular use. The new standard does not apply to magnetic jewelry, even if it is marketed to children. Magnetic jewelry has come up and we have talked about it , but our commission is focused on toys, Kazianis said. A toy has play value. A piece of jewelry does not. It appears to fall through the cracks. It's possible that the jewelry industry could follow our standards for toys , he added. I have repeatedly stated we need to figure out a way to communicate to them. Michael Gale , spokesman for the Fashion Jewelry Trade Association, said he did not believe magnetic jewelry is dangerous. Anything that could affect the safety of children is a concern to the fashion jewelry industry , he said. I am not aware of any cases of magnets associated with jewelry causing any injuries. The new magnetic toy standard applies to magnets that have a flux index , the measure of its power , of 50 and higher. The Tribune asked Joe DiMarco, an engineering physicist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, to test the magnetic earrings as well as the type of Magnetix toys blamed for the death of Kenny Sweet on Thanksgiving Day 2005. The tests showed the magnets from a Magnetix toy had a flux index of just above 50. The tests of the magnetic earrings showed a flux index on all of them above 50, and most were above 100 -- more than twice as powerful as the Magnetix. Magnetic earrings sold by Schylling, a Massachusetts toy firm, had a flux index of more than 100, the Fermi tests found. The magnetic earrings carry a choking warning for children under age 3, but no other warnings. The earring packaging states that they are for ages 5+. Schylling did not return telephone calls. Earrings sold by Claire's also tested well above the toy standard of 50 and in one case was more than five times higher than the toy standard. Claire's did not return calls seeking comment. DiMarco noted that the flux index increases when more than two magnets get stuck together. If you combine more than a couple of these together , you could easily get something much worse. One brand , Magna Stud, sold by BeWild.com, carries a warning against use by anyone under age 13 and warns specifically that the jewelry poses an inhalation and aspiration hazard. ... Keep out of reach of infants. The jewelry also warns against wearing more than one magnet in the nose. Brian Cohen , owner of BeWild.com, said he had never noticed the warning until the Tribune brought it to his attention. Somebody wanted to make sure nobody got injured , he said. Anything small like this should be kept away from kids , and magnets make it worse. Complaints to the CPSC about magnetic jewelry include one incident that sent a 2-yar-old boy to the hospital after swallowing a magnetic earring. Other incidents involved boys and girls ranging from 8 to 13 years old. One 13-year-old boy used magnet jewelry to mimic a tongue piercing and swallowed the magnet. A 13-year-old girl sniffed magnet earring backs into nose , according to the agency's database. Dr. Anthony Magit , a pediatric otolaryngologist in California, described how quickly a child can be injured. The magnets are fairly strong and instead of just holding the earrings on the outside of both sides of the nose , they pull together and get embedded in the septum and they can't get them out, he said. It can happen in a day. The magnets burrow into the septum and cannot be pulled apart. They are so strong , you have to take them to the hospital to get them removed. There needs to be a warning. The CPSC was informed earlier this year of the medical community's concerns about magnets -- in toys as well as jewelry -- when Dr. Alan Oestreich , a pediatric radiologist at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, addressed an agency symposium. I emphasized that it was not just magnetic toys , but magnets in jewelry, he said in an interview. I think people should be informed that this is a danger. Doctors aren't the only ones pressing the CPSC to take further action. When U.S. PIRG , a federation of state public-interest research groups, issued its 2007 toy safety report in November, some magnetic earrings were on its list of dangerous products. Our contention is that magnetic jewelry poses the same hazard to children as magnetic toys , said Edmund Mierzwinski , consumer program director and author of the report. Just because something is not a toy does not mean it's not a hazard. If it's cheap children's jewelry , it's a hazard. That also is the conclusion of at least one retailer. In the pre-Christmas rush in 2006 , Diana Nelson, owner of Kazoo & Co. , a Denver toy store, enthusiastically sold magnetic jewelry, telling an industry publication that magnetic earrings were a top-selling item. A year later, after becoming aware of the dangers of magnets in toys, Nelson has concluded that magnetic jewelry should not be sold to children. We sold a lot of them , but when we sold out, I decided I wouldn't order them again, she said in a recent interview. They shouldn't be anywhere near little ones.  ",

Populist opposition to international integration is also on the rise in much of continental Europe, and has always been the norm in much of Latin America. The question now is: What should be the guiding principles of international economic policy? How should the case be made by those of us who believe that the vastly better performance of the global system after World War II than between World War I and World War II was largely due to more enlightened economic policies? The mainstream approach to these questions generally starts with some combination of rational argument and inflated rhetoric about the economic consequences of international integration. Studies are produced about the jobs created by trade agreements, the benefits of immigration and the costs of restrictions on trade. In most cases, certainly including the cases for TPP and against Brexit, the overall economic merits are clear. But in this advocacy there is a kind of Gresham 2019s Law (the economic principle that bad money drives out good), whereby bolder claims drive out more prudent ones, causing estimates to often be exaggerated and delivered with far more confidence than is warranted. Over time, this has caught up with the advocates of integration. While there is a strong case that the United States is better off than it would have been if the North American Free Trade Agreement had been rejected, the most extravagant predicted benefits have not materialized. And it is also fair to say that claims that China 2019s accession into the World Trade Organization would propel political liberalization have not been borne out. In any event, the willingness of publics to be intimidated by experts into supporting cosmopolitan outcomes appears, for the moment, to have been exhausted. The second plank of the mainstream approach is to push for stronger policies to resist inequality, cushion economic disruptions and support the poor and middle class, then argue that if domestic policies are right, the pressure to resist globalization will be attenuated. The logic is right, and certainly, measures such as the GI bill, the government 2019s assurance of available mortgages and the interstate highway system were part of the political package that permitted the United States to underwrite an open international system through the 1960s. But the past eight years have seen the United States at last make significant progress toward universal health insurance, expand a variety of support programs for the poor and bring unemployment below 5 percent. Even still, trade has become ever less popular. It is not that strong domestic policies are unnecessary to undergird global integration; it is that they are insufficient. A new approach has to begin from the idea that the basic responsibility of government is to maximize the welfare of citizens, not to pursue some abstract concept of the global good. Closely related to this is the idea that people want to feel that they are shaping the societies in which they live. It may be inevitable that impersonal forces of technology and changing global economic circumstances have profound effects. But it adds insult to injury when governments reach agreements that further cede control to international tribunals of one sort or another. This is especially the case when, for legal reasons or reasons of practicality, corporations have disproportionate influence in shaping global agreements. If the Italian banking system is badly undercapitalized and the democratically elected government of Italy wants to use taxpayer money to recapitalize it, why should some international agreement prevent it from doing so? Why shouldn 2019t countries that think, likely wrongly, that genetically modified crops are dangerous get to shield their customers from such crops? Why should the international community seek to prevent countries that wish to limit capital inflows from doing so? The issue in all these cases is not the merits. It is the principle that intrusions into sovereignty exact a high cost. What is needed is a responsible nationalism 2014 an approach where it is understood that countries are expected to pursue their citizens 2019 economic welfare as a primary objective but where their ability to damage the interests of citizens of other countries is circumscribed. With such an approach, the content of international agreements would be judged not by how much is harmonized or by how many barriers to global commerce are torn down but by whether people as workers, consumers and voters are empowered. This does not mean less scope for international cooperation. It may mean more. For example, tax burdens on workers around the world are as much as a trillion dollars greater than they would be if we had a proper system of international coordination that identified capital income and prevented a race to the bottom in its taxation. And taxes are only the most obvious area in which races to the bottom interfere with the achievement of national objectives. Others include labor and financial regulation, along with environmental standards. Reflexive internationalism needs to give way to responsible nationalism 2014 or else we will only see more distressing referendums and populist demagogues contending for high office. Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers wrote this piece for The Washington Post.  ",

An indictment unsealed Wednesday alleged that Washington took money that had been donated to a charity he founded, Project Contact Africa, and used it to pay for jewelry and vacations, among other things. He was charged with counts including interfering with internal revenue laws. Washington was charged in an indictment filed in Kansas City, Mo., on Monday. He was arrested Tuesday in Los Angeles, said Tammy Dickinson, the United States attorney for the western district of Missouri. A lawyer who prosecutors said would be representing Washington did not return a message seeking comment. Washington,64, played in the N.B.A. in the 1970s and 1980s for several teams, including the Los Angeles Lakers, the Boston Celtics and the San Diego Clippers. He is perhaps best known for, as a Laker, throwing a punch that fractured the face of the Houston Rockets 2019 Rudy Tomjanovich during a game in 1977. STAYING ANOTHER YEAR Kris Jenkins, who made a buzzer-beating 3-pointer in Villanova 2019s championship victory over North Carolina, and guard Josh Hart will return to the program next season rather than leave for the N.B.A., which had set Wednesday as the deadline for players to decide if they would enter its draft. The Rangers rookie Nomar Mazara, the youngest player in the majors, hit the longest home run of the season as Texas beat the visiting Los Angeles Angels, 15-9. Mazara,21, drove a pitch high into the second deck in right field at Globe Life Park, a ball that would have traveled an estimated 491 feet had it landed unimpeded. Rougned Odor, Mazara 2019s Texas teammate, drove in three runs in what may have been his last game before a suspension for punching Toronto 2019s Jose Bautista during a bench-clearing brawl on May 15. A decision on his appeal is expected before Friday 2019s game against Pittsburgh. ARRIETA REMAINS UNBEATEN Jake Arrieta allowed four runs for the first time in nearly a year but still captured his ninth win of the season as the Chicago Cubs won at St. Louis, 9-8. Kris Bryant hit a three-run homer, and Jason Heyward and Ben Zobrist each drove in two runs in support of Arrieta, who became the second nine-game winner in the majors, after the Chicago White Sox 2019 Chris Sale. BRADLEY 2019S STREAK CONTINUES Jackie Bradley Jr. extended his major-league-best hitting streak to 29 games, and Boston beat visiting Colorado, 10-3, as the Red Sox won their fourth straight. The Red Sox have scored eight or more runs 10 times in their last 14 home games. And Bradley is not the only hot player for Boston: Xander Bogaerts homered to put his hitting streak at 18 games. AROUND THE MAJORS Brandon Crawford hit a run-scoring single with two outs in the 10th inning, and the surging San Francisco Giants beat the visiting San Diego Padres, 4-3, for their 13th win in 14 games. Matt Duffy singled off Brad Hand (1-2) with one out and advanced on a wild pitch one out later before Crawford drove a pitch past Padres center fielder Jon Jay. 2022 Cleveland roughed up a top White Sox pitcher for the second straight game and beat host Chicago, 4-3.

Brady was suspended last May for four games for what Goodell said was a scheme to use improperly inflated footballs in the A.F.C. championship game in January 2015. The Patriots went on to win the Super Bowl. The suspension was overturned by a federal judge before the 2015 regular season, but a circuit court panel ruled, 2-1, last month that Goodell had been within the rights granted to him by the collective bargaining agreement.

   "input": "John Harris 2019s article 201cMoney for nothing 201d (G2, 14 April) is a welcome change from the screeds we read on corruption and excessive payouts. The idea of a social wage or universal basic income (UBI) has been around for some time, as he points out. Now it seems to be moving from utopian ideal to the realm of politics and practical life. This surely is to be wished for by all concerned in questions of social justice. A central belief of contemporary capitalism is that the labour of the worker is a commodity like any other in search of a buyer. In various ways the law alleviates this (eg the minimum wage) but does not change the basic thinking. Now there is the possibility that the livelihood of every member of society, independent of work availability and wage levels, is recognised and assured. Let us hope the idea is explored publicly and allowed to fructify.John ThomsonForest Row, East Sussex 2022 The most shocking statement in John Harris 2019s piece was that only six [now seven] Labour MPs signed up to Caroline Lucas 2019s early-day motion on universal basic income. Do the other 222 think Labour stands for unremitting toil and inexorably growing inequality? Even the SDP considered backing a citizen 2019s income back in the 1980s. Equality and the Ownership Question (Tawney Society Paper no 34, 1986) addressed the issue of how the population at large could share in national wealth in a time of growing differentials between an inordinately overpaid elite and an insecure underpaid serfdom. Ideas floated in the 80s included variants on a social dividend, whereby publicly listed companies would be required to issue a percentage of new shares each year (a process known as equity dilution) to be lodged in a citizen 2019s trust that would provide all citizens with a growing dividend on the profits of the whole economy, thus converting monopoly capital into equitable income. Its dividend issues might start modestly with each new cohort reaching the age of 18 and expand upwards, allowing other parts of social welfare to be focused on groups who would never benefit. Such a scheme would put a brake on the accumulation of unearned wealth, and be safe from the whims of chancellors. Of course, a government in a hurry might decide to prime the equality pump by first freezing, then top-slicing, the billions in assets hidden away in tax havens under British jurisdiction. Richard GravilPenrith, Cumbria Related: Should we scrap benefits and pay everyone 00a3100 a week? 2022 Thanks for a great article on UBI. The next step is to integrate this with a shift towards expenditure taxation, so the basic income acts as a tax allowance, a sort of 201ctax cashback 201d, which gives the expenditure tax a progressive nature and also is harder for the multinationals and the rich to avoid. Dr Jon MulbergFelixstowe, Suffolk 2022 Is this idea exclusive to Britain? What about eastern Europe, Africa, Latin America and practically everywhere east of Suez? If we all have a standard UBI, what do we suppose that income might buy? If Harris were my age, he might remember that, as computerisation moved into the workplace, the talk then was of work-share, and further education was considered necessary for the future. As we have increased the numbers at university, the numbers of graduate baristas has risen disproportionately. If a universal basic income is not to be the badge of people who can 2019t get their heads around the idea of a rational economy, anyone talking UBI has first to make the sums add up.Martin LondonHenllan, Denbighshire 2022 I strongly support the implementation of a universal basic income, but feel that it should be paid only to citizens who have lived in the country for 16 years. Those born here would receive it at 16, which would support them with their further education, higher education and apprenticeships. It should be set at the same level as the living wage, and would replace the old age pension and the jobseeker 2019s allowance. Other benefits would be paid on top for those in need. Trevor RandallGreat Missenden, Buckinghamshire 2022 UBI already exists: it 2019s called the state pension. It should be easy to see how it works and affects enterprise and the labour market. It would also be possible to extend it progressively to younger ages, until some adverse effect was observed, or it met child benefit and became effectively universal. Odd that recent governments want to raise pensionable age until it meets age at death, and becomes extinct. David BowlerPerth 2022 The citizen 2019s wage sounds a wonderful idea, if only to lower the anxiety many have. But how do we make sure that the disabled have the extra income they need? Who will be willing to do the hard work of childcare, and looking after the elderly, for very little extra? These problems need working out but should not stop the whole idea.Christina Naylor Languenan, Brittany, France 2022 Join the debate 2013 email  ",

   "input": "A state watchdog agency on Wednesday signaled its support for Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 2019s plan for closer ties with two hospitals, part of the health system 2019s effort to compete more aggressively against Partners HealthCare and other providers. Beth Israel Deaconess is seeking a clinical affiliation with MetroWest Medical Center, which would allow it to expand specialty medical services at MetroWest while gaining a new source of patient referrals from the Framingham-based hospital. It also wants to add MetroWest and New England Baptist Hospital to its affiliated network of health care providers that negotiates contracts with insurers. The Massachusetts Health Policy Commission indicated that it would not take steps to try to stop the new relationships because they could lead to improved care and more competition. The commission does not formally approve or reject health care deals. Rather, it studies how deals are likely to affect the broader market and refers any serious objections to the attorney general. In this case, the commission said the tie-ups could result in 201csmall to moderate 201d increases in medical spending, about $4.5 million a year. But it also said there is potential for savings if the Beth Israel Deaconess network maintains its moderate prices and successfully diverts patients from higher-priced providers, such as Partners. The deals also could improve the quality of care delivered to patients, the commission found. The findings were a sharp contrast to the commission 2019s earlier reports on proposed acquisitions by Partners, the parent company of Massachusetts General and Brigham and Women 2019s hospitals. When it studied those deals, the agency raised strong objections, arguing that allowing Partners to acquire South Shore Hospital and Hallmark Health System would raise spending as much as $49 million a year while giving Partners, the state 2019s largest health system, even greater market power. Partners later dropped both deals. But on Wednesday, commissioners noted that the growth of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Beth Israel Deaconess Care Organization, or BIDCO, could be a good thing. BIDCO is a network of affiliated doctors and hospitals that negotiates contracts with insurers and gives its members set budgets under which to manage patient care. 201cTo me, big is not necessarily bad, 201d said Marylou Sudders, the state secretary of health and human services, who sits on the commission. 201cShouldn 2019t Massachusetts have... a strong competitor to what is the largest and most expensive health system? 201d The commission said that by adding MetroWest and the Baptist to its network, BIDCO will solidify its place as the state 2019s second largest provider network. But it will remain much smaller than Partners, with about 13 percent of all hospital discharges, compared to 29 percent for Partners. Jeffrey Hulburt, BIDCO 2019s chief executive, said he was pleased with the commission 2019s findings. 201cThey came to the conclusion we had hoped they would come to, 201d he said. 201cTheir report shows that both transactions we asked to bring forward are really unlikely to impact health care costs in the market. 201d Dr. Stan Lewis, chief system development and strategy officer at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, said the commission was 201cvery complimentary 201d of the hospital 2019s strategy to create a network that contains costs while improving the coordination of care.

The senior Labour MP warned that misogyny, racism and homophobic abuse were all growing online, as was revenge pornography, in which people distributed sexual photos or videos of former partners without permission. It came as the former cabinet minister Maria Miller, who now chairs parliament 2019s women and equality committee, said the time had come for a 201cwholesale review 201d of the laws that govern online activity. The comments come after the Guardian launched a major series called the Web We Want, which revealed the darker side of online comments on its own website. Cooper called for online threats, harassment and stalking to be included in the Crime Survey for England and Wales, and said other media providers should carry out research similar to that done by the Guardian. She welcomed a Crown Prosecution Service consultation on cyber-related offences, but said there was still no regular reporting of stalking, harassment or threatening behaviour of a criminal nature. 201cIn the 1970s and 80s women across Britain and across the world took to the streets to 2018Reclaim the Night 2019. Women and men campaigned together for safer streets, for stronger action to stop physical violence against women, and to argue that there should be no no-go areas for women 2013 the streets and public spaces should belong to everyone, 201d she said. Cooper argued that abuse on the internet was today 2019s equivalent, and she has launched a campaign called Reclaim the Internet, which will hold a conference in late May. Miller said there was now an urgent need for legislation that would support police work in an online age, and said MPs were planning to get together to try to drive forward the agenda. 201cThere needs to be a wholesale review of the way the law works for the most prevalent online crimes, and that includes online abuse, 201d she said. She said that a new law around revenge pornography introduced a year ago had given people confidence to bring forward complaints, driving up the numbers from a handful of cases to regular reporting of the issue. The challenge, argued Miller, was to help the police by identifying types of abuse online so they did not have to rely on a 201cpatchwork of law 201d to deal with different issues. 201cThere is growing recognition that a laissez-faire approach ... isn 2019t working, 201d she added. But Polly Vernon, the author of Hot Feminist, who suffered a steady stream of low-level abuse online, said it wasn 2019t just about things that were unlawful. She said she 201cfelt dehumanised, mildly depressed, anxious and body dysmorphic 201d after an outpouring by her critics, who she said were 201cswept up in the sport of being cruel on Twitter 201d. 201cWhat they do isn 2019t high-level trolling, of the kind Cooper 2019s concerned with; it isn 2019t death or rape threats, it isn 2019t anonymous, 201d she said, arguing that people felt it was admissible to attack her after columnists wrote negatively about the book. 201cI think people don 2019t entirely realise that what they are doing is bullying, shaming, piling in en masse on one individual who may well suffer badly as a result of that treatment. I did. 201d Vernon said that she was now utterly disinclined to write with honesty about her life experiences and admitted it took therapy to help her get over it. 201cI have almost disengaged from Twitter now. It 2019s the only way I can bear to write and publish things I truly think, feel and behave. 201d Cooper agreed that there was a risk that people were being driven offline when the internet ought to be a 201cforum for wild and wonderful debate, passionate argument and free speech 201d. She said the silencing of women daring to speak their mind ought to be of great concern. Cooper 2019s campaign is cross-party and will focus on how police and prosecutors can tackle hate crimes, threats and intimidation. It will also look at the responsibilities of social media platforms, which have taken action to improve reporting and blocking mechanism, but which could do more to counter hate speech. Cooper said the Guardian had led the field with the Web We Want series, but said it wasn 2019t just journalists who were targeted. The conference will also look at what individuals can do when faced with abuse. The MPs involved want to make sure that the next generation do not think that online misogyny is acceptable.  ",

   "input": "One week ago, against the advice of its political establishment, Britain narrowly voted to leave the European Union. Within a few days, that establishment was in the process of a full-scale implosion: the country is effectively without government or opposition, shorn of leadership, bereft of direction. As the pound crashed and markets tanked, the chancellor of the exchequer went missing for three days while Boris Johnson, the most prominent member of the Leave campaign, spent the weekend not sketching out a plan for the nation 2019s future, but playing cricket and writing his column for the Telegraph. Having asserted its right to sovereignty, the country can now find nobody to actually run it. Meanwhile, the very prize won in the referendum 2013 to leave the EU 2013 remains unclaimed. Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty sets out the process for leaving the EU. Once invoked, a country has two years to negotiate the terms of the divorce. But no one will touch it. Prime Minister David Cameron, who led the losing campaign to remain in the EU, announced his resignation within hours of the result, insisting that his successor should be the one to pull the trigger. Johnson, who is favoured to replace Cameron, protests that there is 201cno need for haste 201d. During the campaign, our departure from the EU had many proud and pushy parents. In victory it is an orphan. Cutting the figure not so much of a failed state as a state intent on failure, the nation 2019s credit rating was downgraded, its currency devalued and its stock market depleted. On polling day the Leave campaign reminded us that we were the fifth-largest economy in the world and could look after ourselves. By the following afternoon our currency was sufficiently decimated that we had fallen to sixth, behind France. Related: Brexit: a disaster decades in the making In the ensuing panic, some politicians argued that we could simply ignore the referendum result: David Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham, suggested it was 201cadvisory and non-binding 201d, and urged parliament to call another referendum, in order to avert economic catastrophe. A huge number of people petitioned the government to do the same 2013 while the eminent barrister Geoffrey Robertson insisted a second referendum was not necessary to overturn the result: parliament could just vote it down. 201cOur democracy does not allow, much less require, decision-making by referendum, 201d he wrote. 201cDemocracy has never meant the tyranny of the simple majority, much less the tyranny of the mob. 201d It was argued that we could not leave the final word on such momentous decisions to ordinary voters: they didn 2019t know what they really wanted, or they had been tricked into wanting something that would hurt them, or they were too ignorant to make informed choices, or maybe they quite simply wanted the wrong thing. A significant portion of the country was in the mood for one big do-over 2013 a mood enhanced by considerable class contempt and the unmistakable urge to cancel the universal franchise for 201cstupid people 201d incapable of making the right decisions. Everything had changed 2013 we had decided to end a more than 40-year relationship with our continental partners and the consequences were far-reaching. In Scotland independence was once again in play; in Westminster, resignations from the shadow cabinet came by the hour; in the City, billions were wiped off by the day. Indeed, one of the few things that didn 2019t budge was the very issue that had prompted it all: our membership of the European Union. The only thing we know for sure is that we don 2019t know how and when we will actually leave it. We are simultaneously in freefall and at a standstill, in a moment of intense and collective disorientation. We don 2019t know what is happening and it is happening very fast. But the only thing worse than the result and its consequences is the poisonous atmosphere that made it possible. The standard of our political discourse has fallen more precipitously than the pound and cannot be revived as easily. This did not happen overnight, and the sorry conduct of the referendum campaign was only the latest indication of the decrepit state of our politics: dominated by shameless appeals to fear, as though hope were a currency barely worth trading in, the British public had no such thing as a better nature, and a brighter future held no appeal. Xenophobia 2013 no longer closeted, parsed or packaged, but naked, bold and brazen 2013 was given free rein. A week before the referendum, an MP was murdered in the street. When the man accused of killing her was asked his name in court he said: 201cDeath to traitors, freedom for Britain. 201d On the day after the referendum, many Britons woke up with the feeling 2013 some for better, some for worse 2013 that they were suddenly living in a different country. But it is not a different country: what brought us here has been brewing for a very long time. The thing people often forget about Aesop 2019s fable of the boy who cried wolf is that in the end, there really was a wolf. Indeed, the story wouldn 2019t have its moral if the wolf didn 2019t show up and ravage the shepherd boy 2019s flock. Lying has consequences that last far longer than individual acts of deception: it ruins the liar 2019s ability to convince people when it really matters. The source of the mistrust between the establishment and the country isn 2019t difficult to fathom. Next week the Chilcot inquiry will publish its findings into the Iraq war. After Iraq, we faced an economic crisis that few experts saw coming until it was too late. Then followed austerity; now the experts said this was precisely the wrong response to the crisis, but it happened anyway. When leaders choose the facts that suit them, ignore the facts that don 2019t and, in the absence of suitable facts, simply make things up, people don 2019t stop believing in facts 2013 they stop believing in leaders. They do so not because they are over-emotional, under-educated, bigoted or hard-headed, but because trust has been eroded to such a point that the message has been so tainted by the messenger as to render it worthless. This was the wolf we were warned about. It is now mauling our political culture and savaging our economic wellbeing. We were warned of it by leaders in whom we had no confidence. So we all chose the facts we liked, and we all suffered. The wolf does not discriminate. As Aesop reminds us at the end of the fable: 201cNobody believes a liar, even when he 2019s telling the truth. 201d When leaders choose only the facts that suit them, people don 2019t stop believing in facts 2013 they stop believing in leaders This distrust is both mutual and longstanding, prompting two clear trends in British electoral politics. The first is a slump in turnout. In 1950, 84% of Britons voted in the general election; by last year it was 66%. The decline has not been uniform, but the general trajectory has been consistent. Between 1945 and 1997 turnout never went below 70%; since 2001 it has never reached 70%. The second is a fracturing in political allegiance. For most of the postwar period, British electoral politics was effectively a duopoly. In 1951, 97% of votes were cast either for Conservatives or Labour. By last year, the combined total was 67%. Fewer people want to vote, and fewer voters want the two major parties. With a first-past-the-post system, designed to ensure that one of those parties wins a majority, our governments now preside with diminished legitimacy over a splintered political landscape. Cameron 2019s Tories were elected last year with only 24% of the eligible vote. In 1950, Winston Churchill was defeated even though 38% of eligible voters backed him. These trends had similar consequences for the tactics of the two major parties. Under Cameron, the Conservatives, who had lost two prime ministers to the question of Europe, were able to abandon the most nativist elements of their base in order to pursue votes in the centre, rebranding themselves as the sensible party of British modernity. No longer 201cthe nasty party 201d, the Conservative leadership embraced gay marriage, aggressively sought non-white spokespeople, and took a more moderate line on Europe than its members felt comfortable with. Labour could also reposition itself, in the knowledge that it could keep winning elections even as it kept losing voters. Those who voted for Brexit tended to be English, white, poor, less educated and old. With the exception of the elderly, these have traditionally been Labour 2019s base. But the party has been out of touch with them for some time. The New Labour project made the party 2019s appeal both broader and shallower: there was a sharp pivot rightward, made with the conscious calculation that its core supporters had nowhere else to go. The coalition of metropolitan liberals, city-dwellers, ethnic minorities, union members, working-class northerners and most of Scotland slowly began to fray. Poverty went down and inequality went up. Appeals to class politics gave way to more aspirational messaging. While covering the 2001 election, I recall the indifference that met Tony Blair on the campaign trail. He would appear in front of small, curious crowds, and then wave over their heads into the middle distance for the cameras. They voted for him 2013 the alternative was William Hague running around in front of a pound sign 2013 but they were not remotely engaged or inspired by him or his party. The leave campaign did not invent racism. The deployment of bigotry to suit electoral ends has a longstanding tradition In areas that Labour once had a stranglehold on, its vote slumped. Blair took his third victory in 2005 with only 9.5 million votes 2013 fewer than Neil Kinnock managed when he lost to Margaret Thatcher in 1987. As long as the economy was doing well, a significant proportion of voters just stayed home 2013 and there was no way to tell how soft the remaining support was until it was tested. Now those tests have come: in Scotland from the SNP, and in England and Wales from Ukip. It may seem a minor matter in the wake of this referendum to say that our political parties are failing in their historic mission, but we would not have arrived here were they not doing so. The party set up by trade unions to represent the interests of workers in parliament no longer commands the allegiance of those people. True, almost two-thirds of Labour voters did vote remain 2013 but an overwhelming number of the working-class, the poor, and the left-behind put their faith in leave. Meanwhile, the party of capital and nation has presided over a painful blow to the City and the Union. Neither party is fit for purpose. The leave campaign did not invent racism. The deployment of bigotry to suit electoral ends has a longstanding tradition in this country, which is often denounced even by those who have done exactly that. Neglect, both benign and malign, and indulgence, both covert and overt, left those prejudices open for opportunists to exploit for their own ends. This was one such opportunity. Liberal commentators have come to automatically identify poorer Britons with an ingrained loathing of foreigners, but in fact the British working class has a distinguished history of anti-racism: from the Lancashire mill workers boycotting cotton picked by slaves in the American Confederacy to the battle against fascism at Cable Street, and the campaigns of the Anti-Nazi League and the Anti-Apartheid Movement. In the last year, thousands of ordinary people have made their way to Calais with supplies for refugees. Like all classes in Britain, however, it also has a bleak history of racism, which can make the journey from the street to the ballot box. Sometimes this has taken the form of open calls for white racial solidarity against non-whites. Sometimes it has taken organised forms, in the shape of Oswald Mosley 2019s New Party, the National Front, or the British National Party. And at other times, it has been neatly folded into the fabric of mainstream politics. The National Front rose to prominence in the 1970s, but saw its advance blunted by Margaret Thatcher, who promised to be tough on immigration, and expressed sympathy for people who 201care really rather afraid that this country might be rather swamped by people with a different culture 201d. Then came the BNP, which triggered a brief period of intense scrutiny and concern when it won a council seat in the Isle of Dogs, east London, in 1993. By 2003, the party had 17 councillors, and by 2008, more than 50 around the country. By increments, the BNP became a constant, if contested, fact of British municipal life. In the 2009 European elections, the party 2019s leader, Nick Griffin, won one of two BNP seats in the European parliament. That same year, Griffin found himself on BBC1 2019s Question Time. The rise of Ukip would later suck up all the oxygen on the far right, and Griffin would disappear, only to be replaced by Nigel Farage. More blokey and garrulous, less abrasive and boorish, Farage narrowed the focus to Europe and, by doing so, widened the far right 2019s appeal. The divisions such movements sow have always posed a particular challenge for Labour, since the party 2019s core base of support is vulnerable to social and economic change to start with. That is why nativist parties always play best during times of recession, when resources are scarce and people are looking for someone to blame. In a letter from 1870 that, with a few words changed, could have been written any time in the past few years, Karl Marx vividly described this dynamic: 201cEvery industrial and commercial centre in England possesses a working class divided into two hostile camps, English proletarians and Irish proletarians. The ordinary English worker hates the Irish worker as a competitor who lowers his standard of life 2026 This antagonism is artificially kept alive and intensified by the press, the pulpit, the comic papers, in short by all the means at the disposal of the ruling classes. 201d The Tories have consciously fanned these flames. In 2005, when the Tory leader Michael Howard ran his whole general election campaign on immigration, with the insidious slogan 201cAre you thinking what we 2019re thinking? 201d, the party 2019s MP in Castle Point, on the Essex coast, asked in one leaflet: 201cWhat bit of 2018send them back 2019 don 2019t you understand Mr Blair? 201d During that election, I drove from the least diverse constituency in the country 2013 St Ives in Cornwall 2013 to the most, which was in east London. In Cornwall, the Liberal Democrat MP, Andrew George, said the racism he was hearing was a particular worry. 201cIt 2019s the one resonance issue that 2019s favouring the Tories, 201d he told me. 201cOn the doorstep people aren 2019t saying: 2018I 2019m voting Conservative because of their tax spending plans. 2019 People have been saying, 2018We only came down here to get away from the blacks, 2019 and there was no self-consciousness about saying it out loud. I 2019m very disturbed about it. Maybe they 2019re not playing the race card. But they 2019re playing the immigration card and that 2019s right next to the race card in the deck. 201d This week, David Cameron condemned 201cdespicable 201d xenophobic attacks in the wake of the EU referendum. But just last month he was galvanising the Tory faithful in London with claims that the Labour mayoral candidate, Sadiq Khan, was in cahoots with an imam who, Cameron alleged, supported Isis. That claim was so utterly false that if the prime minister did not enjoy parliamentary privilege against charges of defamation, he would have had to pay damages to the imam, as the defence secretary Michael Fallon was forced to do when he repeated the remarks outside the House of Commons. With a few notable exceptions, Labour 2019s response has been less crass but no less calculated. Labour tends to condemn outright bigotry before clothing it in the cosy blanket of understanding and concern for the bigot. It protests and then it panders. It routinely points out that racism is bad, but is rarely brave enough to make the case for why anti-racism is good. This leads to the worst of all worlds. Racism and xenophobia are condemned but never challenged, which leaves those who hold such views feeling silenced and ignored, but never engaged. This, in turn, leaves them prey to hucksters like Farage, who can claim to speak for them. After his party lost a seat in Smethwick, West Midlands, in 1964 to a notoriously racist campaign, the Labour minister Richard Crossman concluded that: 201cIt has been quite clear that immigration can be the greatest potential vote-loser for the Labour party. 201d This view was shared by Tony Blair 2019s government. Blair chose the white cliffs of Dover for a 2005 election speech on refugees and immigration 2013 when it was time for the photo call, there wasn 2019t a black face to be seen. In 2006, as the Iraq war descended into chaos, home secretary John Reid turned his focus on the enemy within 2013 intolerant Muslims. 201cThis is Britain, 201d Reid told the party conference. 201cWe will go where we please, we will discuss what we like, and we will never be browbeaten by bullies. That 2019s what it means to be British. 201d A few years later Jack Straw lectured Muslim women on what to wear when they came to his surgery. The effect was not to blunt the rise of organised racism but to embolden it, making certain views acceptable and respectable. It was embedded in our political language and institutions and then left to fester. We have yet to see a general election in which race and immigration are the defining issues. If that were the case, one would expect to see Ukip do far better that it has previously. At an election, people vote for parties that they believe, on balance, identify with their concerns on a range of issues. But this was not a general election. It was a referendum on membership in an unloved institution that was the source of mass migration on a scale that the government had not anticipated, and that most Britons were not prepared for. Although much has been made, since the referendum, of results showing that areas with little migration were most opposed to it, we should not underestimate the jolt that accompanied the effects of free movement within a newly enlarged European Union. I left Britain for America in 2003, before it opened its borders to the east. After a few trips back in 2005, I simply stopped assuming that white people in London spoke English any more. The transformative potential was clear even then: states may import workers, but it is people who actually come. My parents came from Barbados in the 1960s, planning to stay for a few years, make some money and head back 201chome 201d. Instead they had kids and stayed. I saw no reason why many of these new immigrants wouldn 2019t do the same 2013 and I wondered how the language we used to talk about race and migration would change now that there were so many new arrivals who were white but not British. In the past, pollsters and politicians had elided the two issues 2013 considering 201crace immigration 201d as a single area of concern. That was never true or accurate, but the new situation made it even more clear that we needed to have a sophisticated conversation about migration and race. Not the conversation that politicians always claim we are avoiding, about the dreadful impact of migration 2013 but a conversation about our needs as an ageing nation, about our economic and foreign policies, about how immigrants contribute far more in taxes than they take in benefits, and about the fact that there are considerably fewer of them than British people think. (For instance, in a recent Ipsos Mori poll, on average, respondents thought that EU immigrants accounted for 15% of the population 2013 the true figure is about 5%.) But that is not all: we needed to have a conversation about the resources that communities require to accommodate an influx of new arrivals 2013 school places, hospital beds, housing 2013 and about who was responsible for cutting the budgets that used to provide these things. But that is not the conversation we are having. It is not even the conversation we have never had. It is the conversation our leaders have desperately and wilfully avoided. For decades, the issue of race (the colour of people) and immigration (the movement of people) have been neatly interwoven, as though they are one and the same thing 2013 as though 201cBritish 201d people are not also black and black people are not British. It has been profitable for politicians 2013 and not only Nigel Farage 2013 to sow confusion about the difference between migration from the EU and elsewhere, or the distinction between economic migrants and asylum seekers. The argument that this was a vote about 201ceconomic 201d issues 2013 since the hated European migrants were not brown or black 2013 is belied by the deliberate commingling of every type of foreigner. It was not an accident that the 201cBreaking Point 201d poster, revealed by Farage on the morning of Jo Cox 2019s murder, showed Syrian refugees coming into Slovenia, an image with almost no relevance to the issue on the ballot. Xenophobia and racism are easily blended, and they become an especially potent toxin among a population that no longer trusts its own leaders. To describe this as a working-class revolt against the elites is to give the elites more credit than they are due. With both sides run by Old Etonians and former Bullingdon boys, the elites were going to win no matter who you voted for. It would be more accurate to say that the results reflected an ambivalence toward the elites on both sides. When leaders who you believe don 2019t care about you 2013 and can do nothing for you 2013 tell you what is in your best interest, it 2019s reasonable to ignore them. People who were told they would lose out in the recession to come felt they didn 2019t have much to lose; people who were told that belonging to the EU gave them certain rights and advantages did not see they had any value. It would be as much of a mistake to assume these people consciously voted for Faragism as to think they could never be tempted by it. On this point, those who voted remain should, at the very least, concede that had we voted to stay in, the country would not be having this conversation. If remain had won, we would already have returned to pretending that everything was carrying on just fine. Those people who have been forgotten would have stayed forgotten; those communities that have been abandoned would have stayed invisible to all but those who live in them. To insist that they will now suffer most ignores the fact that unless something had changed, they were going to suffer anyway. Those on the remain side who felt they didn 2019t recognise their own country when they woke up on Friday morning must spare a thought for the pensioner in Redcar or Wolverhampton who has been waking up every morning for the last 30 years, watching factories close and businesses move while the council cuts back services and foreigners arrive, wondering where their world has gone to. Many of those who voted leave will undoubtedly feel that they have had their say after years of being ignored. But they are beginning to discover that they have been lied to. Even when it feels that there is nothing left to lose, it turns out that things can always get worse. And even when it feels like nobody tells you the truth, it turns out that some factions of the elite can and will do more damage to your life than others. One of the defining illusions of the populist rightwing agenda is that it possesses a unique ability to rally the poor on the basis of race and nation 2013 but even here, it cannot deliver on its own terms. The leaders of the leave campaign have been in a furious retreat since their moment of triumph: they have walked back promises to control immigration, to quit the single market, and to 201cgive our NHS the 00a3350m the EU takes every week 201d. Leaving the EU does not diminish the power of the multinationals that moved manufacturing jobs overseas, or the financiers whose recklessness led to the closure of libraries and the shrinking of disability benefits. We have not opted out of global capitalism. Something will now be done about the free movement of labour 2013 but capital will still have the run of the place. The anger that has been unleashed is not being directed at the elites. Instead it is flying every which way to alarming effect: black people are being abused in the street; a Polish community centre has been defaced; eastern European children are being taunted in schools. Liberals are blaming the poor, Cameron is blaming Boris, the Daily Express is blaming the EU ( 201cBrexit Vote is EU 2019s Fault: Ignoring Britain was Big Mistake 201d), business is blaming Cameron and Boris, Scotland is blaming England, London is blaming the rest of England, children are blaming their parents, and the EU is blaming all of us. On 31 December 1999, as American television viewers watched around-the-clock coverage of the arriving millennium, one time zone at a time, the ABC newsreader Peter Jennings offered an appraisal of recent British history as he watched the fireworks light up the sky over the Thames. 201cThis country has been through so much, 201d he said. 201cIn 1900, when Queen Victoria was on the throne, Britain ruled over one-fifth of the world 2019s population. But for all this fantastic show, Britain 2019s possessions have dwindled to 2026 Well, Hong Kong has gone now and, well 2026 The Falklands are still British. 201d Ever since the Suez crisis, Britain has struggled with its place in the modern world. Nostalgic about its former glory, anxious about its diminished state, forgetful about its former crimes, bumptious about its future role, it has lived on its reputation as an elderly aristocrat might live on his trust fund 2013 frugally and pompously, with a great sense of entitlement and precious little self-awareness. Related: Trident: the British question , Ian Jack Once great, now not so great, it has struggled to find a status in its post-colonial iteration that fits its size and budget. We punch above our weight culturally, have significant clout economically and suffer painful delusions of grandeur militarily (let 2019s not talk about football). Where foreign policy and defence are concerned, Britain 2019s desire to be taken very seriously is the chief obstacle to it being taken more seriously. One of the central reasons for keeping the Trident weapons system, we are told, is so that we can keep 201ca seat at the table 201d. Our military involvement in Syria was intended not to be decisive but to send a message. And then there was Iraq. In most cases Britain craved a role for itself as the sole reliable conduit between America and Europe. Peripheral to the action; central to the process. The fact that our ability to fulfil that function for the US has been severely diminished 2013 President Barack Obama asked us to remain and we wouldn 2019t even listen to him 2013 may be one of the few good things to come out of this whole mess. Indeed, our lesser status has already become clear from the attempts that have been made to negotiate ourselves out of the situation we just voted ourselves into. While we were in the EU, Europe was prepared to try and make it work, even though we were a severe irritant. Now that we 2019ve voted out, they just want us gone. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, could not have been clearer. She 2019s not interested in Britain holding another referendum, and is not inclined to give it any special favours. There would be no 201ccherry-picking. There must be and there will be a palpable difference between those countries who want to be members of the European family and those who don 2019t. 201d In other words, we will now be treated like any other country 2013 which is precisely what we assumed we weren 2019t. This melancholic grasping for our former glory has not served our politics well and is a key to understanding how this happened. In the absence of any substantive argument about how 201ctaking back control 201d might look in the 21st century, we got men like Farage and Johnson waving flags and pounding their chests. The route map out of this sorry situation will not be achieved by reversing the results of an election (even if that were desirable) or renegotiating a deal with the EU (even if that were possible). It will come through some broader reimagining of Britain that pays more attention to work, fairness, community and equality, than to flag, nation, anthem and culture. For the last 15 years, governments and the press have stoked fears about whether British culture could withstand the integration of Muslims 2013 of whom 70% voted for remain 2013 when they should have been worried about how to integrate the white working class into the British economy. Brexit didn 2019t create these problems. It exposed them and will certainly make them worse. The decision as to whether we live in or out of the EU has been made. The choice before us now is whether we are finally ready to confront the issues that we have blissfully denied and engage with the communities we have carelessly ignored.

But nothing we know now about the TPP gives me any confidence that workers will end up with the good jobs and protections they deserve. There 2019s been a lot of talk about winners and losers in various aspects of this deal. Spoiler alert: Corporations seem to win at every turn at the expense of working people. As my friend Steelworker President Leo Gerard said, 201cTPP may be the final blow to manufacturing in America. Our producers and workers are under siege from other nations 2019 massive overproduction, foreign currency devaluation, our own lack of long-term infrastructure investment and the strong dollar. 201d 1. Omitting currency rules from TPP will undermine all of its touted market-opening benefits. Currency manipulation has already caused thousands of U.S. factories to close and millions of workers to lose their jobs. A TPP without currency rules turns a mighty river of offshoring into a tsunami. 2. The inclusion of corporate courts (for investor-to-state dispute settlement) is a win for global business. Giant firms who use the U.S. as a flag of convenience but produce little here can now invest in Australia, Japan and Malaysia, then sue over laws and regulations they don 2019t like. They will be able to collect billions from taxpayers to compensate for lost profits. 3. It could hurt U.S. automakers. Japanese auto manufacturers are thrilled with the new rules because TPP will reduce U.S. tariffs on cars and trucks Japan sends to the U.S. Those cars may have a Japanese name on the outside, but everything that actually makes it a working car could be Chinese. I don 2019t know how U.S. Trade Representative Mike Froman can look at any auto supply chain worker in the U.S. (or Canada or Mexico for that matter) and tell them with a straight face that TPP is a good deal. 4. It 2019s unclear whether the labor provisions will benefit workers. While there may be some small improvements to the labor chapter, we have first-hand experience that rules are worthless without enforcement. Until we see the actual text, we won 2019t know how much these promises live up to their hype. Sadly, terrible trade deals have affected working people for the past four decades. Based on past performance, those who believe the same old promises will suffer, while those who wish to abuse and exploit workers with little pushback from governments will profit.  ",

   "input": "Vermont utility Green Mountain Power recently became the first U.S. utility to sell batteries from electric car company Tesla to its customers. With the batteries, homeowners can tap into back-up power if the grid goes down or pair the batteries with solar panels so they can use solar energy at night. While a handful of utilities plan to buy energy from large battery banks manufactured by Tesla, the Vermont utility is unique in its decision to sell small home batteries to regular homeowners. The move is particularly unusual because the U.S. market for home batteries is the smallest 2014and most over-hyped 2014part of the emerging grid battery market. According to GTM Research, only 4 megawatts worth of batteries have been deployed by U.S. homeowners to date. That 2019s tiny, compared with the 164 MW worth of batteries that are estimated to be installed in the U.S. in 2015, mostly in large projects for utilities or in commercial and industrial buildings. The home battery market is very small because it often doesn 2019t pay off for the customers who buy the batteries. In contrast, businesses can use batteries to shift electricity for their buildings over to batteries during times of day when grid electricity is expensive. Doing so can save businesses significant money on their monthly energy bills. At the same time, utilities see batteries as a cheaper alternative to building and using expensive peaker power plants that are only turned on during peak times of day. So what does the Vermont utility know that others don 2019t? Here 2019s three reasons why Green Mountain Power is taking this unusual move to sell 500 Tesla batteries to its customers: 1). A progressive utility: As The New Yorker wrote earlier this year, Vermont 2019s main electricity provider is operated by a rare utility executive who has an entrepreneurial background. While many regulated utilities see their customers as a sea of electricity meters, CEO Mary Powell runs her utility more like a customer-focused tech company such as an Apple [fortune stock-symbol=AAPL] or a Google [fortune stock-symbol=GOOG]. Powell has eagerly embraced new technologies that can deliver clean power, and low carbon products, to her progressive customer base, but at the same time she has mostly kept electricity rates flat. Tesla 2019s Powerwall battery is another technology perk that Powell can offer her customers if they want it. The company proudly touts the battery on the its website 2019s home page. 2). Off grid storm season: One of the main reasons why U.S. homeowners would want to buy a battery is for back up power. In that way Tesla 2019s home battery is competing with backup generators. Vermont, with its many rural areas, and harsh winter seasons, is one region of the U.S. where back up power can be attractive and worth investing in. A typical power outage in winter in Vermont can last 2.5 hours. 3). Smart home experiment: Green Mountain Power has been helping its customers modernize their homes, using digital energy technology, and adding solar panels, smart appliances, thermostats, and heat pumps. The utility can use this upgraded energy network to turn down the home 2019s air conditioner or water heater during peak times of electricity use. In the energy world this called 201cdemand response. 201d A Tesla battery is just another asset that the utility could potentially tap into to make the grid and home smarter, and to help the utility better manage its network. If Green Mountain Power customers agree to share their batteries with the utility, the customers will pay significantly less than if they had complete control over the battery, notes Greentech Media.

A de facto couple have pleaded not guilty to Tia Landers' murder but the court heard the woman on trial had boasted to an undercover policewoman that we carved her up. Ms Landers' body was discovered , wrapped in a blanket, in a shallow grave at Beerburrum State Forest near the Glasshouse Mountains in July 2014 with more than 30 wounds to her body. John Edward Harris and Linda Eileen Appleton on Monday pleaded guilty to interfering with her corpse and two counts each of deprivation of liberty. In his opening remarks to the jury, crown prosecutor Philip McCarthy said an undercover police officer was placed in Appleton's cell soon after her arrest. She will tell that officer: 'We carved her up , we chopped her up, we chopped her up with a machete, he said. Mr McCarthy said Appleton then gestured two gun shots to the head. He said Harris told a fellow prisoner that he fired the shots that killed her and he had had an affair with Ms Landers while Appleton was previously in jail. He said two acquaintances - Jake McKenzie and Ryan Morgan - were with Landers when she was tortured and then murdered on June 16 , 2014. They will testify how she had pleaded for her life and they were ordered to clean up the blood before being driven home. Mr McCarthy said prior conversations between the accused couple, recorded while Appleton was incarcerated over another matter, showed her feelings towards Landers. That scum slut probably f***ing stole them , he alleged Appleton told Harris during a phone call , referring to jewellery she believed Ms Landers had taken. I'm going to bust that bitch so f***ing bad , I am going smash her f***ing skull in.

He told the jury a handgun and silencer found at their home matched bullet fragments in Landers' body, which was seriously decomposed when found.

That man gave me a lot of ice he said during the conversation which stopped at times as he appeared to read passages from a bible he was clutching. On Wednesday , the 38-year-old was found guilty of murdering Ting Huang, whose partially decomposed remains were found on September 21,2014, near Rockwood cemetery in Lidcombe. The NSW Supreme Court jury rejected the submission that his culpability should be reduced to manslaughter due to his suffering a substantial impairment of the mind at the time. A psychiatrist told the jury Fang was suffering from a drug-induced psychosis, having earlier experienced hallucinations and delusions caused by the toxic effects of methamphetamine. Eleven days before Mr Huang's body was found, Fang told his pastor he had done something to another person and made a throat-slitting gesture. The next day he went to police making admissions about having killed someone. During his conversation he hit himself in the head , gave answers and made unintelligible comments and was in a blank, daze-like state. His behaviour led police to arrange for him to be mentally assessed. No drugs were found in his system and he was released, as police had no details about a body or a crime. But 10 days later they received a parking complaint about a green Honda near Rookwood cemetery and found Mr Huang's body wrapped in a doona in the boot. He had multiple stab wounds and high levels of methamphetamine in his body. While Fang was found to have no drugs in his system when he saw police, an expert said ice was very quickly eliminated from the body of a living person. He later told a psychiatrist he had used ice for about 12 months, saying that from July 2014 he knew things were not right. He reported having argued in August or September with Mr Huang , who came from the same Chinese province as Fang, and them taking a lot of ice. He said he woke a few days later at home, thought he had done something wrong and went to police. His sentencing hearing will be held on February 3.  ",

The action followed the group interrupting the House of Representative yesterday, by super-gluing their hands to the railings of the public gallery and chanting.

But the next day the foreign minister, responding to the ensuing uproar in diplomatic, humanitarian and business circles, back-pedalled by saying that foreigners could stay if no qualified local person could be found to do the job. If the original edict had been enacted, it could have spelt economic and humanitarian disaster for a fledgling country already mired in civil war, penury and administrative chaos. Tariq Riebl, director of Oxfam GB in South Sudan, is one of many influential foreigners who immediately urged the government to change its mind, arguing that the measure, if implemented, 201cwould massively disrupt aid programmes across the country which feed over 1m people. South Sudan is on a knife-edge and could easily tip into famine in 2015. 201d Oxfam alone says it reaches 300,000 vulnerable people.

But he said the Americans had no indication before the sheik arrived at the house where he was going, and knew that Mr. Zarqawi was there only when Mr. Rahman arrived. At that point, the general said, there were no coalition ground troops positioned near the house. Similarly, he said, the United States Air Force F-16 fighter jet that dropped both bombs was one of two aircraft that were on a routine mission in the area , with no planning for the bombing, when they were ordered to carry out the attack immediately. One of the jets was refueling from an aerial tanker, so the mission fell to a single bird , he said. In Hibhib , Lt. Col. Thomas Fisher, in charge of a group of American soldiers patrolling the overall area, said he was ordered late Wednesday to get his men as quickly as possible to the site, what was described as a time sensitive target. His earliest soldiers got there 90 minutes after the airstrike; an American commando team had already come and gone. We didn't know it was Zarqawi , Colonel Fisher said. General Caldwell declined to say how Mr. Rahman was being tracked , or how exactly the American command knew once he reached the house that Mr. Zarqawi was there. But from what he did say, the strong implication was that the Americans were relying on a combination of remotely piloted surveillance aircraft and electronic intercepts of the phone being used by Mr. Rahman. The combat camera images of the attack released on Thursday showed a large white dot circling the target area at relatively low altitude before, during and after the bombing, the characteristic signature of a reconnaissance drone. General Caldwell said that the surveillance of Mr. Rahman in the past month had shown that there was a pattern in what he did when he was preparing for meetings with Mr. Zarqawi. We knew that he did certain things when preparing for a meeting , the general said, and all these things in fact happened when he arrived at the house and went inside. The general gave no details , but accounts circulating in Baghdad in recent days, citing unnamed Iraqi officials, have said that Mr. Rahman, apparently wary of using a cellphone because of American monitoring, relied on a Thuraya hand-held satellite telephone when calling Mr. Zarqawi. One of the features of satellite phones is that a caller usually has to be outside a car or building when he makes the calls, in order for the handset to have a direct line to the satellite. The aerial drone appeared to have provided the geographic coordinates that were crucial to the bombing, and possibly the laser beam that guided the first bomb. General Caldwell said that the first bomb dropped by the F-16 pilot was a GBU-12 laser-guided bomb, and that it was guided to the target by a laser beam that was independently directed at the house. The second bomb, which the general identified as a GBU-38, was guided to the target by pinpoint coordinates that the pilot had to program into his weapons system, and the generals said these coordinates came from an overhead asset , apparently the drone. The general said that the delay between the first and second bombs was 96 seconds , the time it took for the pilot to plug in the coordinates, and that the pilot's orders were to drop both bombs. When asked who gave the final order for the attack, and whether it was given by Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the top American commander in Iraq, General Caldwell paused. Just before the bomb was dropped , General Casey was informed, he said. The decision for an airstrike rather than a ground assault was made largely because American officers viewing images of the area were concerned that Mr. Zarqawi could escape. From the house in the palm grove , General Caldwell said, Mr. Zarqawi had a 360-degree option to get away. Eventually , he said, the American military would have an amazing story to tell about the operation , one that involved weeks of assembling an intelligence jigsaw, some of it drawn from high-technology tracking of Mr. Rahman, some of it good old human intelligence gathered from Iraqis and other sources , which he did not name. Asked if it were true that Jordanian intelligence officials had been crucial in identifying Mr. Rahman as the key to hunting down Mr. Zarqawi, as some Jordanian officials have claimed, the general was evasive. We could not have done this without our coalition partners and the support of all our partners in the global war on terrorism , he said. Mr. Zarqawi could hardly have picked a more secluded hideaway. The house outside Hibhib sat about 400 yards off the main road and was accessible only by a dirt road. The building lay in a grove of date palms , with the nearest house about 300 yards away. An irrigation canal ran along the property. The American and Iraqi soldiers guarding the site on Saturday said they were not surprised that Mr. Zarqawi had chosen the area. American and Iraqi troops rarely patrol the area, in large part because it is so remote. The local residents, the adults, anyway, do not smile and do not wave, the American soldiers said. People in this area like Zarqawi , said Adil Abid Hussein ,33, an Iraqi soldier guarding the house. Dexter Filkins reported from Hibhib for this article, and John F. Burns from Baghdad.  ",

   "input": "WASHINGTON, May 5 0097 To anyone who doubts the stakes for the White House in this year's midterm Congressional elections, consider that Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the Democrat who would become chairman of the Judiciary Committee if his party recaptured the House, has called for an inquiry into the possible impeachment of President Bush over the war in Iraq. President Bush walking to the Oval Office last week, trailed by Karl Rove, left, his chief strategist, and Allan B. Hubbard, his assistant for economic policy. Mr. Rove is helping lead Republican midterm election efforts. Or listen to Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, who would run the Senate Judiciary Committee if the Democrats took the Senate. Mr. Leahy vowed in a recent interview to subpoena top administration officials, if he got the chance, to answer more questions about their secret eavesdropping program and what he considers faulty prewar intelligence. The prospect of the administration spending its last two years being grilled by angry Democrats under the heat of partisan spotlights has added urgency to the efforts by Karl Rove and Mr. Bush's political team to hang on to the Republican majorities in Congress. Newly shorn of the daily policymaking duties he took on after the 2004 campaign and now refocused on his role as Mr. Bush's chief strategist, Mr. Rove is facing an increasingly difficult climate for Republicans, and an increasingly assertive Democratic Party. The ambitious second-term agenda he helped develop has faltered even with a Republican Congress. His once-grand plans for creating a broadened and permanent Republican majority have given way to a goal of clinging to control of the House and Senate. The prospect of Democrats capturing either, however, may be one of the best weapons Mr. Rove has as he turns to what he has traditionally done best: motivating his party's conservative base to turn out on Election Day. Heading into the election, many conservatives are disheartened by the war in Iraq, upset at what they see as a White House tolerance for bigger government and escalating federal spending, and divided over issues like immigration. The abrupt resignation on Friday of the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Porter J. Goss, promised to feed the impression of an administration that is off balance. But White House and Republican officials, trying to turn vulnerability to advantage, say conservatives could be united and re-energized by the possibility that Democrats could put Mr. Bush and his policies on political trial by winning control of even one chamber of Congress. Senate Republicans sent out a fund-raising letter this week seeking to use that possibility to fire up the base, warning that a Democratic majority would put fighting terrorism on the back burner and that our worst fears could be realized. The appeal is just one indication of how hard the White House and its Republican allies are likely to fight from now through Nov. 7 and of the challenge Mr. Rove faces in what could be the last campaign he orchestrates with the party. At stake is not just what remains of Mr. Bush's hopes of making a permanent imprint on policy , but also whether Democrats will have a platform to define his presidency for history. With so much on the line, Mr. Rove has taken to traveling the country to form strategies with individual candidates and local parties while brainstorming with the president's political and policy teams on broad items the White House can pursue to help Republicans everywhere. He is focusing on only the major planks of Mr. Bush's agenda and not the minutiae of policy that had consumed hours of his day. In regular West Wing breakfast sessions catered by the White House mess, Mr. Rove and the White House political director, Sara Taylor, have already been reaching out to nervous and vulnerable Republicans, three at a time, laying out an emerging three-prong attack on Democrats over national security, taxes and health care. In meetings at the White House, aboard Air Force One and in candidates' home states, Mr. Rove is trying to rally Republicans to stand by the president and his agenda. He has focused in particular on uniting them behind the administration's proposals to overhaul immigration, which include guest worker provisions that conservatives despise; the Iraq war, which has driven Mr. Bush's poll numbers sharply downward; and the Medicare prescription drug program, which the administration says will cost $872 billion from 2006 to 2014 and which Mr. Bush backed enthusiastically despite complaints from conservatives that it was a vast expansion of the social welfare state. Democrats need a net gain of six seats to win control of the Senate, and 15 for the House. With the overall outcome potentially coming down to one or two races, nearly every district and state seems to be getting some attention from Mr. Rove. He enlisted the president, and called on his own, to persuade Representative Elton Gallegly of California, a 10-term veteran, to reconsider a decision to drop his planned re-election campaign because of health worries.

Corey Haim would love it , he was very excited about the fact we were making (another) one. He did some interviews and said that while he couldn't be part of it, he was looking forward to seeing how his character would develop, Corey Feldman , who was joined by his original co-star and Frog Brother Jamison Newlander , told Fox 411's Pop Tarts at the Comic Con Convention in San Diego over the weekend. This film is actually dedicated to Corey. When you see the film , there are scenes that pertain to his character and most people when they watch the film will believe that we shot it after he was gone. It is unclear why Haim was excluded from the third film , but Feldman assured us that they always had solid plans for him to rejoin the cast for the yet-to-be developed fourth installment. We we're actually discussing what we were going to do with his character. The idea was to introduce his character in a way in the third and bring him back for the forth. So it is very sad for the loss , both personally and as part of the franchise, he continued. It is sad , and a bit shocking when you watch the film. It is very eerie. SLIDESHOW: Corey Haim - 1971 - 2010 On another note , Megan Fox recently tied-the-knot with longtime lover Brian Austin Green, yet that isn't discouraging Feldman from seeking out the sexy starlet - all in the name of a professional pursuit, of course.

Megan Fox , he said. 201cI read a couple of weeks ago that she had stated that 201cLost Boys 201d was one of her favorite films and would love to be part of the franchise if we were to do another one , so you never know. The possibilities are endless. 201d And while Twilight and its cast of aesthetically attractive vampires has certainly spawned an international sensation over the last couple of years , Newlander and Feldman want you to remember that R-Patz and K-Stew are only variations on of a trend they feel that they ultimately conceived. We're here to reclaim our stakes. We were one of the first to start the teen vampire film , and in our new film there are a few nods to the 'Twilight' saga, Feldman added. But at the same time we're back , we're the originals fighting vampires and we look damn good doing it.  ",

   "input": "Xenofon Kavvadias with two of the sealed terror manuals. Photograph: Martin Godwin The government's anti-terror law watchdog has become involved in an artist's attempt to use jihadist handbooks and extremist tracts in his work. Lord Carlile of Berriew has advised Xenofon Kavvadias after the Metropolitan police warned the Greek artist he could be arrested and prosecuted under the Terrorism Act if he mounts an exhibition featuring texts such as The Islamic Ruling on the Permissibility of Martyrdom Operations, a justification for suicide bombings used by Chechen extremists. Kavvadias, a graduate of Central St Martins School of Art and Design who has lived in the UK for six years, sought Lord Carlile's advice when he staged his MA degree show, featuring the covers of three extremist texts secured in centimetre-thick clear plastic cases in an attempt to explore the legal boundaries of freedom of expression. He now wants to install a bookshelf in an art gallery stocked with texts presented in court to secure terrorism convictions. They include Defence of Muslim Lands by Sheikh Abdullah Azzam, a jihadist who influenced Osama bin Laden, The Mujahideen Poisons Handbook, which details how to kill using homemade ricin and how to make poisons from tobacco and potatoes, and the Manual of Afghan Jihad (also known as the al-Qaida Manual), which explains how to plan, finance and execute terror attacks. Courts have handed down custodial sentences for possession of these and similar documents. Last year Khalid Khaliq, a friend of two of the 7 July 2005 suicide bombers, was jailed for 16 months for possession of the al-Qaida Manual. Kavvadias says he is a pacifist and has no sympathy with Islamist extremism, but wants to use art to reclaim something that is lost right now: freedom of publishing and freedom of expression. He argues that most of the texts he proposes to feature are accessible on the internet and is keen to point out that the broad wording of anti-terrorism legislation criminalises thousands of people who have no criminal intent. The Met's director of legal services told him the police are duty bound to investigate acts relating to the commission , preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism 2026 this includes offences about the possession, collection or record-keeping of information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism. However , Carlile, the government's independent reviewer of anti-terrorist legislation since 2005, has offered cautious encouragement to the project. I am sure there is a visual arts context into which counter-terrorism legislation can be put , he advised. The best and shortest answer to your question is that you are unlikely to be prosecuted , and if prosecuted not convicted, if you do not break sections 57 and 58 of the Terrorism Act 2000 2026 I am sorry that I cannot answer your question more directly than that, but I am afraid that the law is no less conceptual than fine art. Carlile told the Guardian: Nobody is going to give him a yes or a no on any particular item. If he shows anything that shows somebody who does not know how to make a bomb , then that would be a bad decision. Kavvadias also placed documents in secure cases in a current exhibition at the 10 Vyner Street gallery , east London. Now he wants to have whole books on display with a reading table and public discussion. I think having these books in a forum like that and in an art context is something essential for an open and free society , he said. My grand project is to design a library [of banned books] for each country to create a portrait of a country's demons and fears. He said the law as it stands means thousands of people who have downloaded copies of terrorist-related tracts and handbooks , are inadvertently putting themselves at risk of prosecution, even when they don't have any criminal purpose. Unless he can secure assurances that he will not be prosecuted under laws that proscribe recklessly inciting others to commit terrorist acts, with a maximum jail term of seven years, he will try to stage the show in the Netherlands.

   "input": "People look at a street art graffiti by elusive British artist Banksy, as part of his month-long exhibit in New York. Photograph: Emmanuel Dunand AFP Getty Images He is the anonymous street art vigilante who uses the nondescript walls of cities to stage million-dollar exhibitions. In many places around the world, Banksy's graffiti art, with its strong political motifs, has become a cultural symbol and a community treasure. This month he is in New York, for what is expected to be a month-long residency featuring several new projects. However, with great artistic acclaim and value comes a surge in commercialization. Many of Banksy's murals 2013 prized greatly by art fans but even more so by private property owners 2013 have been displaced and auctioned. In Los Angeles in August, a Banksy Flower Girl piece was removed from a gas station and put up for auction. The starting bid was $300,000. In February, a piece entitled Slave Labour disappeared under mysterious circumstances from a North London Poundland store, only to turn up in a Miami auction later that month, with an asking price of $700,000. And then there are the Banksy pieces that have been put at risk simply because of their public nature. In Bristol, Gorilla in a Pink Mask was painted over by a building's new owners, who thought it was just a vandal's graffiti. In New York this week, Banksy's first mural was tagged by other artists within hours 2013 before being erased entirely. Regarding such threats of removal or damage to public art, cities are faced with two questions: should they protect the art? And if so, how? Banksy's murals are most often public art drawn 2013 illegally, in some cases 2013 on private property. This raises issues of ownership and preservation. Amy Adler, professor of art law at New York University, suggests that amendments to planning legislation are therefore a possible next step , in order to empower public authorities to preserve art in public spaces. In Los Angeles, legal proceedings were brought when a large mural by the artist Ed Ruscha, on private land, was suddenly painted over. This was one of the few instances in which a work of public art was protected under federal visual artists rights regulations, preserving the work even if the ownership of the physical property changes. Adler contends, however, that in Banksy's case, for this to apply , Banksy himself would have to file for protection, which given his penchant for anonymity and illegality of his graffiti, he does not do. When a mural has been put on a publicly owned space , local authorities have greater power to decide what to do 2013 in some cases, they have taken on the task of preservation themselves. In 2006, Bristol city council polled residents when a Banksy image appeared on a public clinic: 97% said they wanted it to stay. However not everybody agrees that the art should be preserved. In New York, authorities reacted less kindly to a Wall Street rat painting, critical of corporate America, and Let Them Eat Crack was ordered to be painted over. Banksy's Pulp Fiction bananas suffered the same fate after Transport for London claimed it employed cleaners and not professional art critics. If we condone this then we might as well say that any kid with a spray can is producing art , Robert Davis , the chairman of Westminster Council's planning committee, said at the time. To go and deface other people's property is graffiti. Just because he's famous doesn't give him that right. Steven Thomas , a partner at the Irell & Manella law firm in LA, lends supports to this stance, as the moral rights of Banksy are trumped by the fact trespass on the property took place. The building owner or local council can do as they wish. Local governments find themselves powerless when the piece is on private property , where the retention depends on the owner. The recent removal of Slave Labour from a convenience store wall in London was a sting to the local community who regarded it as a source of pride to an otherwise degenerate area. The local Haringey Council protested that public works should not be for private enjoyment. It was eventually sold in London, though not reinstalled on the wall. In 2011 John Webster of the University of Bristol, in Banksy's home town, suggested the addition public art to national historic registries. In the US, though, the National Register of Historic Places considers pieces of historical interest or great artistic value , but only after at least 50 years. The UK only considers significant work after 15 years 2013 but does protect it under a National Trust Lottery fund. Webster therefore proposes that an extension to criteria would have to be considered to incorporate protection for future generations. Regarding the situation in the US, Phillipa Loengard, director at the Columbia Kernochan Center for Law and Arts, says: The problem with the register is that the whole building would have to be listed resulting in more bureaucracy with developers and owners. She cites a recently overturned ordinance by the Los Angeles city council that now allows street artists to paint murals in public. Cities should instead adopt something like the California Civil Code 989 which allows any community group to ask for protection by the building owner , if they fundraise for the preservation. The legislation requires recognized quality and substantial public interest which is yet to be tested , but this could prove to be the way forward for many different communities. Successful preservation has happened when local groups work directly with the artists and property owners to come to an agreement 2013 something which is hard to do with a mysterious artist like Banksy. Adler says: The real problem we have is the rich irony of cultural preservatio. The intention of the work is social change and vandalism. By trying to preserve it , it is contrary to the ethos of the work and subversive street culture.  ",

   "input": "Yesterday morning, at about 3 1 2 o'clock, a boy left in the business office of the TIMES three pages of thin paper, upon which was written what purported to be a proclamation, signed by President LINCOLN, and countersigned by the Secretary of State. It was at once sent to the editorial rooms, and put into the hands of the night Editor. It resembled somewhat the copy usually sent from the office of the Associated Press, though its handwriting was not that which usually comes from that office -- and a perusal of the document led the editor to doubt its authenticity. On inquiry he learned that it was not inclosed in the envelope bearing the stamp of the Associated Press, or in any other, and that the boy who left it had, after throwing it upon the counter, instantly left the office. The editor then sent the manuscript to the office of the Associated Press, with an inquiry as to its origin, and received from the person in attendance the following perfectly satisfactory reply: DEAR SIR: The Proclamation is false as hell , and was not promulgated through this office. The handwriting is not familiar. The document was accordingly denied publication in the columns of the TIMES. It appeared , however, in the columns of the World and the Journal of Commerce. We print the pretended proclamation in another column. Its purport is to order a day of fasting and prayer in consequence of reverses sustained by our arms in Virginia and the probable triumph of the rebellion. It was probably concocted and sent to all the newspapers, at so late an hour as to preclude any close scrutiny into its authenticity, in order that it might go to Europe by the Cunard steamer Scotia, and produce its natural effect upon the foreign markets and foreign sentiment. The object will probably be thwarted, in part at least, by the fact that it was published only in two of the City journals, and those the two most conspicuous for their hostility to the Administration. Nevertheless, all possible use will be made of it by the agents and allies of secession on the other side, and it will undoubtedly produce an effect. Its appearance created a marked excitement and indignation in the City. Gold in Wall-street rose five or six per cent., but fell again as soon as the forgery was exposed. Both the World and the Journal of Commerce posted upon their bulletins a disclaimer of the document, and offered rewards for the detection of the forger. Last evening possession was taken by the military authorities of the offices of both the papers which published the Proclamation, and their publishers and editors were put under arrest, so far as they could be found. It is understood, though not officially known, that this was done by order from Washington; that the World and Journal of Commerce will not be permitted to appear this morning, and that the persons arrested will be tried by a military tribunal on charge of having treasonably attempted to give aid and comfort to the enemy. So far as intent enters into the essence of crime, we do not believe that the editor of either of the journals in question is in the least amenable to so grave a charge. It may be deemed necessary, however, to enforce, by some signal example, upon the conductors of the public press, the necessity of greater caution than has hitherto been exercised in matters of this kind. We are quite sure, however, that Secretary SEWARD, at least, will not exact at the hands of editors a degree of intuitive knowledge as to the authenticity of pretended official documents which even a Secretary of State does not always possess: but it is undoubtedly true, that every newspaper should have an editor who may be held responsible for whatever finds admission to its columns, and that this responsibility should be enforced. The Associated Press has offered a reward of ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS for the discovery of the forger. We think the Government ought to join in the effort for his detection.  ",

Menino, who as mayor worked to lure biotechs and other cutting-edge companies from neighboring cities. Leaders from the five municipalities are set to gather at the Museum of Science Tuesday to formally launch the effort, called the Life Sciences Corridor initiative. They say the alliance could be a springboard to other regional partnerships in economic development, housing, and transportation, ranging from subway improvements to affordable housing for life sciences workers. 201cThere 2019s a lot of talk about Boston operating as a silo, but it 2019s important that our sister cities are strong as well, 201d said Mayor Martin J. Walsh. 201cI don 2019t intend on going to Cambridge and saying to companies, 2018I want you to come to Boston. 2019 201d Under Menino, the city took a Boston-first approach toward businesses seeking to relocate, expand, or establish a presence in the region. When Menino learned of opposition in Cambridge to a proposed new site for Millennium Pharmaceuticals two years ago, he quickly invited the cancer drug maker to the South Boston Waterfront. Ultimately, Cambridge approved the Millennium plans. Last year, Menino bristled at a decision by Partners HealthCare to move its administrative staff from Boston to Somerville, bypassing a parcel in Roxbury that he favored. Conversely, there was displeasure in Cambridge when Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. decided to move its headquarters to a new complex on the South Boston Waterfront. While the new alliance does not explicitly forbid one municipality from soliciting businesses based in another, it appears to make it less likely. Cambridge is already home to more than 325 of the roughly 500 life sciences companies located in the five Life Sciences Corridor communities. The city 2014 especially Kendall Square 2014 is often considered the industry 2019s national hub. While Cambridge might seem to have the most to lose if other biotech and medical technology clusters grow elsewhere, City Manager Rich Rossi said regional expansion will help everyone. 201cCambridge is doing well and will continue to do well, 201d Rossi said. 201cBut I don 2019t think there 2019s room in Cambridge for every aspect of life sciences. There may be some companies where the cost of the land and buildings in other communities are more within their budgets. The less we 2019re fighting with each other, the better for the region. 201d In recent years, representatives of Boston, Cambridge, and Quincy have jointly met with officials from out-of-state and foreign companies in the Massachusetts pavilion at trade conventions held by the Biotechnology Industry Organization. That process will be formalized, and joined by Somerville and Braintree representatives, at next month 2019s BIO gathering in San Diego, which will be attended by businesses from around the world. The five municipalities will also market the region together at other industry events. Business leaders say a regional approach could help attract companies with different needs. While research firms might gravitate to locations near the academic medical labs in Cambridge or Boston, for instance, businesses looking for less expensive space, more land, or manufacturing sites could consider Braintree, Quincy, or Somerville. 201cEach community has certain assets and attractions, 201d said Quincy 2019s mayor, Thomas P. Koch, whose city is home to a massive distribution center for the medical device maker Boston Scientific Corp. 201cWe have land that might not be available in more densely populated communities. 201d Those involved in the Life Sciences Corridor say it can knit together disparate communities along the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority 2019s Red Line that, historically, have not collaborated. 201cThe notion of the Red Line makes it a very interesting proposition because it 2019s not that easy to get into Kendall Square, 201d where many companies want to go to collaborate, said Glenn Batchelder, chairman of the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council and founder of Civitas Therapeutics in Chelsea. 201cAs you see Kendall Square get more and more developed, the challenge of transportation becomes more important. 201d Alan Fein, executive vice president at the Broad Institute at MIT and Harvard and president of the Kendall Square Association, said he hopes the regional approach can help spur Red Line improvements 2014 such as more trains and better signaling technology 2014 and a push to develop affordable real estate for life sciences companies. 201cTo be a sustainable innovation district, you have to have space that companies at each stage of the development cycle can afford, from startups to very established companies to all the companies in the middle, 201d Fein said. 201cIf you don 2019t have affordable space for the middle companies, you won 2019t have the startups. 201d Somerville, whose life sciences companies include Bioengineering Inc., which designs bioreactors for cultivating cells used in making protein-based drugs, is eager to attract the spillover from the Kendall Square cluster, said Mayor Joseph A.

   "input": "The La Brea tar pits in Los Angeles are the final home of countless ancient animals that became mired in its primordial ebony goo. The more the poor animals fought to free themselves, the more hapless they became. American Honda 2019s headquarters sits just 20 miles south of the tar pits, but the company has exhibited signs of stickiness in recent years, unable to recover the sense of youthful spunk it once commanded. Indeed, the more the company has struggled to recreate its earlier success, the worse its situation has become. For every shining success like the Accord sedan and CR-V crossover, there is a slow-selling disappointment, including the second-generation Insight and CR-Z, the Acura ZDX and RL from Honda 2019s Acura luxury subsidiary, and some less incriminating nameplates such as the Ridgeline and Crosstour 2013 all of which have prompted former Honda fans to wonder what became of the company that once promised to 201cmake it simple 201d. To this, Honda answers with a redesigned Fit 2013 marketed in Asia and Europe as the Jazz 2013 a car armed with all the quantifiable improvements that attend a big global relaunch. There 2019s an 11% rise in horsepower (to 130), a 7.5% increase in torque (to 114 pound-feet), 14% greater range of ratios in the new continuously variable transmission (CVT) and a 16% uptick in fuel economy. These numbers are abetted by improvements to the flipping, flopping and folding Magic Seat, now 21.7% more magical than before. Hocus pocus aside, there is in fact more rear leg and cargo room when the ingenious seat is employed. Kudos to Honda for its unrelenting focus on delivering safety, even in this, its entry-level model. The company expects the Fit to be named a Top Pick by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), a nonprofit financed by the insurance industry, when that group smashes a new Fit into its test barricade. Additionally, the car has a rear back-up camera as standard 2013 years ahead of US government legislation that mandates such equipment 2013 a convex driver 2019s side auxiliary mirror and a passenger 2019s side blind spot camera to help reduce collisions. The 2015 Fit scores 36mpg in EPA combined driving with the automatic CVT and 32mpg with the slick six-speed manual, numbers that move the car from near the bottom of the subcompact class to the top. The CVT 2019s 41mpg highway rating delivers the kind of efficiency that justifies choosing a smaller, rougher-riding subcompact over a bigger, more comfortable one in a way that the old car 2019s averages simply couldn 2019t. As has been true of other recent Hondas, the CVT is fairly unobtrusive when the car is driven gently, even mimicking gear changes at times. Driven harder, though, and the engine drones as the CVT lets it rev eternally at the peak of its power band. The result is aurally displeasing, even if the computer says it is for the best. Salvation is as simple as selecting Honda 2019s excellent six-speed manual transmission, with its light, quick throws and accuracy. So good is it that it reminds a driver of the fun that can be had even in a 201cbudget 201d car. Headlight illumination, a shortcoming in the previous Fit Jazz, has been addressed, as the new car 2019s lights actually do their job on the low beam. Honda boasts of improvements made to hush the usual small-car racket inside the Fit, with an array of sound-deadening mats applied throughout. The effort is successful, although the engine 2019s new direct fuel injection system, an inherently noisy technology, can give the impression of a farm tractor going about its chores in the distance. Does this mean the Fit has powered free of Honda 2019s tar pit? For all the car 2019s many admirable and quantifiable virtues, it is frustrating and disappointing to find it let down by little faults that coalesce into a greater lament. The relative quiet in the cabin serves to highlight the noisy ventilation fan, whose roar drowns out the music (and the engine) even at middle speed settings and not just at full blast. The dashboard continues Honda 2019s current theme of mixing colours, shapes and materials in a seemingly random m 00e9lange that could be best summarised as cluttered. It is the same on the instrument panel, where a panoply of colours and designs vie for the driver 2019s attention. Honda touts the car 2019s 7in infotainment display in the middle of the dash, but while it features iPad-like touch controls, the thing can be quite user-unfriendly, especially while driving. A finger swipe is not the most intuitive way to adjust volume, for example, or to toggle through radio stations. Drivers would do well to isolate such actions to the smart steering-wheel-mounted control buttons. The system does provide good mobile device integration, with support for apps like Pandora in addition to iTunes music. When the Fit is parked, video can even be played through the HDMI cable. But these same features could have been included in a stereo with actual volume and tuning knobs a driver could easily operate while driving. Outside, the Fit carries over its essential efficient shape, with some clear influence from the current Civic around the grille. The resulting car remains recognisably a Fit, but so similar to the original that its styling has to be considered stagnant, even in the test car 2019s resplendent Milano Red finish. On balance, the Fit 2019s progress out of its tar pit is incremental. So many solid upgrades, undermined by less-than-intuitive infotainment controls and cluttered interior styling. This is unquestionably a better Fit, which immediately makes it one of the best subcompact hatchbacks on the market. It 2019s not enough to redeem an entire brand, but it is a confident step out of the oozy morass.

   "input": "If your Starbucks barista had an arm tattoo, would it stop you from ordering your daily espresso? Probably not, but Starbucks, at least for now, won 2019t allow baristas to have tattoos that are visible to customers. But the coffee giant is considering relaxing its dress code in the coming weeks in recognition that fashion tastes have changed. Starbucks SBUX is part of a growing list companies that are grappling with reality that their workforces and customers are increasingly tattooed, pierced and at home in casual clothes. For example, PetSmart PETM recently started letting employees show off their tattoos at work while retailing giant Wal-Mart WMT will soon let its workers wear black pants instead of just khakis. Dress codes are a delicate balancing act for retail and food-service companies, which try to project an image to customers but not be so strict as to make employees quit. For instance, shoppers in Home Depot 2019s massive stores can easily spot employees wearing orange aprons, which also help to reinforce the corporate color scheme. But err into too-strict territory and it could mean an employee exodus. Turnover is already high at retail stores and restaurants, which raises recruiting costs. Research suggests that the cost of replacing workers can reach as high as 50% to 60% of their annual salary because of the extra training required and time human resources spends setting them up to get paid and start their benefits, according to a report by the Society for Human Resource Management. Starbucks says it is considering changes to several employee-related policies, including the dress code, pay, and vacation scheduling. The policy review could result in changes in the next few weeks, a spokesman said. 201cWe are always actively engaged in discussions with our partners to determine how to make their experience better and more valuable, 201d said Zack Hutson, a Starbucks spokesman said. In the company 2019s corporate lingo, 201cpartners 201d are employees. Hutson said retention plays 201ca big part in all the work we do to create the best experience possible for our people, 201d and added the company 2019s retention rate is about half the industry average (Starbucks declined to share the specific figure). Starbucks 2019 review of its dress policies closely coincides with an online petition started by a Starbucks employee intended to pressure the company into changing the dress code to allow visible tattoos. But Starbucks says it was already mulling a change to the policy before that petition appeared. Starbucks has adjusted employee policies in the past following critical news coverage. In one case, it revised how it scheduled work hours for baristas after a The New York Times article showed how a single mother struggled with the erratic hours assigned to her by automated software. Companies have long had dress codes that have shifted with the times. Decades ago, some businesses banned facial hair, which few people consider a problem today. On the other end of the spectrum, are some contemporary retailers that don 2019t seem to have much of a policy beyond wearing the corporate t-shirt. On a recent day at a Walgreens in downtown San Francisco, for example, a cashier with a tattoo of a shooting star on his face, more tattoos up his arms and a red stud piercing below his mouth, quietly worked the cash register without customers paying much attention. PetSmart 2019s policy to allow visible tattoos kicked in earlier this year. But the more liberal policy comes with some fine print that says the body art must be appropriate 2013 as in not containing profanity or nudity. Peet 2019s Coffee & Tea, which also allows visible tattoos, also has a policy in place that the ink must not display anything offensive. Wal-Mart said its took employee feedback into consideration when it updated its dress code, but that the change 2013in particular adding a required blue vest 2013was needed to help customers more clearly spot employees. The new dress code, which goes into effect Sept. 29 at all of the company 2019s large U.S. stores, lets employees wear black pants instead of just khakis. Some employees are complaining about the new look and the financial burden they 2019ll have to take on to buy new clothes to adhere to the new standards. , Richard Reynoso, a Wal-Mart employee, wrote a letter to Wal-Mart 2019s corporate headquarters saying that he couldn 2019t afford to comply with the new dress code, according to the Huffington Post. Retention wasn 2019t a major motivating factor behind Wal-Mart 2019s new dress code policy, according to a spokesman. Instead, the focus appears to be more about the customer experience, though Wal-Mart says its new vests 2013which return to the store after a multi-year hiatus 2013have been well received. 201cThis was really about helping the associates serve customers better and making them more identifiable in the store, 201d said Wal-Mart spokesman Kory Lundberg.

That fact, and many other things nerdy will be celebrated at the San Diego Comic-Con starting later this week, so be sure to check that out if you want semi-spoilers for all your favorite shows. Also nerdy: A raft of tech sector earnings due later today. Here are five things you need to know in business news today. 1. Big guns come out on tech earnings. As earnings continue to roll in, two of the biggest tech companies in the world report today after the close of trading: Apple and Microsoft. It is an interesting time for both of them: Microsoft announced the biggest layoffs in its history last week, while Apple is busy preparing for yet another mammoth iPhone launch (more on that below!). 2. Existing home sales are out today. We 2019ll find out later today how the market for selling existing homes did last month. Experts expect an increase of 2% year-over-year. 3. Apple places biggest-ever iPhone order. Hold on to your hats, the iPhone mammoth is charging out of Cupertino later today, and it 2019ll stomp all over any other news. The Wall Street Journal reports that Apple has placed its biggest-ever iPhone order with its manufacturers, and that the new version of the phone will indeed come in both 4.7 and 5.5 inch versions. Start lining up outside your nearest Apple Store. 4. Is Bill Ackman hosting a live execution of Herbalife? That 2019s kind of the way he 2019s making it seem. The hedge fund guru from Pershing Square is holding a 10 a.m. ET press conference where he promises to detail an 201cincredible fraud 201d at the nutrition products maker. He 2019s not shared any details yet on just what that is, so I guess we 2019ll have to tune in. 5. Note to companies and government agencies: Don 2019t let interns run your Twitter accounts. Look, I 2019m not offering any judgment on someone who plays the Kim Kardashian iPhone game. Posting your status on a government Twitter account, though, probably isn 2019t the best idea. That 2019s what happened to the EPA Water account last night. The tweet was eventually deleted, but the damage was done. And this is only a C-list celebrity, so its not even like it was something worth bragging about.  ",

   "input": "If any company embodies the Age of the Unicorn (the subject of Fortune 2019s latest cover story), it 2019s Slack. The business software maker can easily serve as an example of why we 2019re in a tech bubble. Its namesake product is only eight months old and the company is worth $1 billion. How is that even possible? Is money even real in Silicon Valley? But Slack just as easily serves as an example of how big an opportunity there is. Slack has grown as much as 7% each week since it launched 2014a pace large companies aspire to hit each year 2014adding thousands of new users who pay for the service. The company has 100 employees and it 2019s only burning $100,000 per month. Sure, it 2019s not even a year old. But it 2019s clearly going to be huge. This is how you get to $1 billion so quickly. After ignoring daily inquiries from venture capitalists all summer, Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield decided in September to take a week 2019s worth of investor meetings, 201cto see where things were at. 201d Slack had launched in February, a year after the company shut down a gaming product that never took off. The new product, a collaboration tool for desk workers, was an immediate hit. By April, Slack 2019s early traction was enough for it to raise $42.8 million, valuing the company at $250 million. The news stoked the hype around Slack. Venture capitalists witnessed its rapid adoption at their portfolio companies. The emails from investors had swelled to 10 new funding offers per week. Sometimes it from was investors Butterfield knew. (He had previously co-founded the photo-sharing site Flickr, which sold to Yahoo in 2005.) Often they were from complete strangers hoping he 2019d take their money. Slack didn 2019t need the money, but Butterfield decided to test the waters because he believed this era of easy venture capital high valuations would not last forever. 201cI 2019m one of those people who think the other shoe has yet to drop from 2008, 201d he says. 201cI lost a shitload of money in 2008, and I saw the fundraising environment tighten up. I 2019m aware of the cycle. It 2019s difficult to call a top, but it 2019s pretty obvious we 2019re far from the bottom. 201d There 2019s another, slightly less rational reason Butterfield decided to raise more money: He wanted a $1 billion valuation. If Slack couldn 2019t get that, he wouldn 2019t raise anything. The cachet of the figure is meaningful in an intangible way, he says. It means 201cwe 2019re a part of that conversation about companies worth $1 billion. 201d He elaborates: 201cIt 2019s definitely a psychological threshold and it helps for certain kinds of customers. When [we 2019re] negotiating with a Fortune 500 company on legal terms of service for some detail about what sort of deal they will get in the third year, then having the comfort of knowing we 2019re highly valued and financially secure, that really helps. 201d A billion dollars goes a long way with big hires, too. 201cThere is a class of employees who are more risk-averse and work at some company like Google or Facebook and they have a mortgage and kids, 201d he says. 201cIt helps a lot of those kinds of people as well. 201d But is the $1 billion valuation actually based on any real metrics? Were any numbers crunched, any spreadsheets analyzed, or any public comps selected? Not really. 201cThere are fairly precise methods for putting a value on future cash flow given steady business, 201d Butterfield says. 201cWe 2019re not in that position, obviously. 201d Put another way: Slack is growing too quickly for projections. At its last public announcement,45,000 teams with 365,000 daily active users were paying to use Slack. 201cEvery single day except holidays is a record for that day, 201d he says. 201cEvery Tuesday is the best Tuesday we 2019ve had. 201d So why not pick the big, round number that helps with customers and recruiting? Butterfield acknowledges there 2019s quite a bit of growth baked into Slack 2019s valuation. 201cYou have to choose some numbers, 201d he says. 201cOne billion is better than $800 million because it 2019s the psychological threshold for potential customers, employees, and the press. 201d Slack had no problem getting investors to agree to the $1 billion valuation, by the way. Butterfield only wanted to raise $100 million; he ended up with $200 million in commitments and closed the round at $120 million. In the three months since raising the money, Slack has just about doubled everything 2014customers, revenue, users 2014and Butterfield expects it will repeat the feat in the next four months. So far Slack has only spent around 1% of the money it raised, Butterfield says. He 2019s confident that even if the economy turns south, Slack will be fine. 201cWe 2019re able to weather pretty much any storm, 201d he says. 201cYou 2019d have to be in a meteors-hitting-the-earth scenario before Slack as a business would get into trouble. 201d For more on Slack and the phenomenon of billion-dollar startups, read 201cThe Age of Unicorns. 201d Watch more of our coverage on business Unicorns from Fortune 2019s video team:  ",

   "input": "This post is in partnership with Entrepreneur. The article below was originally published at Entrepreneur.com. Selling a business is never an easy or simple process. However, the rewards can be great, and ultimately, life-changing, so if you do decide to sell there are six key things you need to be aware of that will help you prepare and maximize your chances of success. Getting it wrong before you start can ruin any hopes of a sale and can mean many months of your time wasted. While I specialize in the sale of online businesses and refer to those as examples, these points still apply to business sales whether offline or online. Experienced buyers will see straight through you and the business you are selling and will quickly pass over your offering if they see any red flags. I regularly speak to business owners who believe they have a potential gold mine and expect to command a high selling price based on perceived potential alone. This isn 2019t how it works. If a business is simply a concept without a proven revenue stream then there isn 2019t any value in the eyes of the vast majority of potential buyers. If they were interested in developing their own business from the ground up there are numerous resources to help them get started and they would not be looking to buy something already established in the first place. Buyers want to acquire something that is already successful, not an unproven concept. Another common misconception is that buyers are impressed with revenue figures. Sure, they can sound good, but when it comes down to it the only number that matters is the profit a business turns (see last week 2019s column for more on why revenue is a vanity metric). Take a look at these two scenarios: The monthly revenue for the first site is three times more than the second business, but the actual profit is almost half. Experienced business buyers want to see profit numbers, not revenue. If you are going to claim revenue from a specific source, you need to have verifiable proof. For example, if you are selling advertising space directly, be prepared to show invoices as well as bank statements that show matching deposits. If you are generating revenue through affiliate offers or third-party ad networks with an online business, be prepared to show deposit records and even access to your accounts online so both parties can see the accounts live. I advise clients to use TeamViewer or Skype as a practical way to verify financial claims on smaller business sales where using an accountant is not always practical or cost-effective. The previous success of a business is largely irrelevant at the time of sale, especially if it has been struggling lately. Buyers are interested in recent performance (usually the last 12 months) and future sustainability and viability, especially if you operate in a dynamic space (such as with websites). I commonly hear sellers talk about how successful their business was in the past after a recent drop and 201call it needs is a little work to get back on track 201d. Unfortunately, buyers don 2019t see it this way. They aren 2019t interested in fixing and recovering your business, especially if you are expecting them to pay a premium. However, don 2019t be afraid to show previous years if the business has been growing steadily. Buyers love to see growing revenue and profit figures, especially if you have already made future plans for the business that seem realistic based on past performance. The truth is going to always surface, so be upfront about everything from the beginning. Experienced investors understand that every business is going to have positives and negatives. There is no such thing as a perfect business. If you are honest and transparent from the start there is less risk of a deal going sour because the buyer uncovered something during due diligence that wasn 2019t accurate or an instance where the truth was stretched. Honesty is the best policy in all business transactions and selling any business is no different. Businesses 2014 especially those run 100 percent online 2014 are forever becoming more popular, with so many people looking to become independent and quit their nine-to-five jobs. Consequently, it has lead to a lot of inexperienced buyers inquiring about businesses for sale, which can be a significant time drain, unless you use a broker whose job is to handle questions and vet buyers for you. Selling yourself will lead to a lot of questions 2014 and you need to be prepared to answer them all, regardless of how simple they may sound. Never judge a buyer. You never know whom you are dealing with or the buying power they possess. Someone asking what appears to be a simple question could potentially be a buyer that is new to the specific industry and have deep pockets for investing. Experienced buyers will often hammer the seller with questions in an attempt to turn up inconsistencies and red flags.  ",

   "input": "Fortune 2014 In finance, there should be a three-strikes-and-you 2019re-out rule. If there were, credit default swaps would be headed for the graveyard. Indeed, when JPMorgan Chase JPM announced its $2 billion and counting trading loss a month ago, there seemed to be little explanation of what exactly credit default swaps, the financial contracts the London Whale had been trading, were. Instead, many stories used this short-hand description for the financial contracts instead: the same things that caused AIG to go bust. On Tuesday morning, Jamie Dimon will be in front of Congress again, this time to answer questions from the House Financial Services Committee. Dimon is expected to stick to the same script, literally. Save a few small changes, Dimon 2019s opening remarks are expected to be nearly word-for-word identical to those he delivered when he testified in front of the Senate 2019s banking committee last week. Like last time, there will be a lot of questions about financial regulation and whether banks should be allowed to place risky bets. But once again it 2019s unlikely there will be a lot of questions about credit default swaps and why they are allowed, mostly unregulated, to continue to exist. MORE: The bank that rising amid Europe 2019s ashes Credit default swaps, or CDS, are contracts that allow investors and traders to bet on whether a company, a country or a group of companies, countries or individuals will pay back their loans. In theory, CDS work like insurance contracts. Sellers promise to cover the losses of the buyer of the contract if the loan the CDS is based on isn 2019t repaid. In fact, CDS aren 2019t really used that way. CDS are rarely held until a default occurs. Instead they are traded, in theory rising and falling based on the credit worthiness of a borrower or borrowers. Of course, just because CDS have been at the heart of a number of recent blow-ups isn 2019t a reason to ban them. Stocks weren 2019t banished after 1987, or 2000. The reason to get rid of CDS is that it doesn 2019t work. Reuters recently reported that trading by the London Whale, and the hedge funds that were looking to make money off of the unwinding of JPMorgan 2019s outsized trades, caused the price of certain CDS contracts to jump and fall, even though the actual credit worthiness of the companies the contracts were based on hadn 2019t changed. Bank analyst Dick Bove for Rochdale Securities says the London Whale trades show that the CDS market is manipulated. 201cThere 2019s something wrong with this market, 201d says Bove. MORE: How JPMorgan made its mult-billion dollar blunder Earlier this year, CDS contracts tied to McDonald 2019s MCD , for instance, rose 19%, during a period when there was almost no news about the restaurant company, and certainly no reason to suspect McDonald 2019s would have a harder time paying back its debt. In the same time, McDonald 2019s stock price barely moved, down 1.1%. Markets can become out of touch with reality for some time. That 2019s how we get bubbles. But the problem with the CDS market is that it 2019s so thinly traded that the actions of one player can cause market distortions. That 2019s supposed to be left to the idiocy of crowds. The best question for proponents of the CDS market is when have the contracts actually worked. The CDS contracts sold by AIG only paid out because of Uncle Sam. And you can 2019t even count on bailouts. When Greece was 201cvoluntarily 201d bailed out by the rest of Europe, the country 2019s government bonds were written down by 50%. Yet, the group that governs the CDS market ruled that CDS holders couldn 2019t collect on the insurance they had bought. Voluntary bailouts, as if Greece had a choice, were not covered by CDS. It was just another loophole in a Swiss cheese market. What 2019s more, it 2019s not clear any of this would change under Dodd-Frank. The new financial regulations state that most CDS trades will have to be run through a clearinghouse. But much of the other investor protections that are supposed to rid stock and bond markets of manipulation and fraud still don 2019t apply when it comes to CDS. The recent four-part Frontline PBS documentary on the financial crisis starts with a long description of the CDS market and how it got started. CDS contracts were created at JPMorgan.

   "input": "While sipping vodka sodas at a downtown bar in New York 2019s East Village roughly a year ago, a friend told me he prefers the beverage because it had 201cno calories. 201d That 2019s wrong. Vodka, distilled from grains or potatoes, always contains calories. And making matters worse is the fact that the beverage my friend was drinking was a vanilla vodka, leading me to the next unpalatable fact: Flavored spirits pack even more calories than their unflavored sibling brands. Diageo, the world 2019s largest liquor company, has led the charge to change misconceptions about what exactly can be found in alcoholic beverages. Look at the label of an alcoholic beverage sold on liquor shelves today and you 2019ll see information about the beverage you are consuming is fairly limited. The U.S. Treasury 2019s Alcohol Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) allows labels to announce the classification of the beverage (gin, vodka, etc.), as well as the alcohol content, the brand name and a health warning statement. There isn 2019t much more information beyond that, and certainly no details about what 2019s in the liquid. Diageo last week announced it will begin adding nutritional information 2014 including protein, fats, calories, and carbohydrates 2014 to labels in the U.S., following the TTB 2019s approval in May 2013 that the serving facts could be included, after previously not allowing alcohol companies permission to do so. Diageo, which has fought for such approval for more than a decade, said it can list information in ideal 201cstandard sizes, 201d meaning it can print labels on spirits for a 1.5 fluid ounce size, comparable to a 5-fluid ounce serving of wine and a 12-fluid ounce serving for beer. Diageo has been more vocal than most about giving more information about the nutritional content of alcoholic beverages. The company has run a website called DRINKIQ since 2006 to give consumers more information. The company plans to make changes to the labels in the coming months as brands change or update their labels. It is an arduous process, as the TTB must sign off on each individual label, for each bottle size and every single different flavor that Diageo sells. The U.K. company wants to take this initiative global. It has aspirations to provide nutritional details to all nations it serves, though so far outside the U.S., the company can only provide limited information about alcohol content in a few markets like Australia, Thailand and Great Britain. There 2019s also a broader industry effort to change labeling standards in Europe. The Brewers of Europe, a trade organization that represents more than 5,000 breweries across the continent, on Thursday announced brewers would commit to voluntarily listing ingredients and nutritional information on their brands. 201cWe want Europe 2019s consumers to know the ingredients in beer and how these beers can fit within a balanced lifestyle, 201d said Pierre-Olivier Bergeron, secretary general of The Brewers of Europe. Major brewers, including Anheuser-Busch InBev, Heineken, SABMiller and Carlsberg were among those that endorsed the proposal, although it will likely take some time before labels will feature such information as it is a costly endeavor for such big brands to change the labels on their packaging. In Europe, while Diageo supports the move to add nutritional information on labels, it contends that the 100 milliliters of liquid basis 201cdoes not reflect the reality of the way drinkers consume alcohol, and is therefore misleading. 201d For example, the 100 milliliters basis in Europe is a third of a typical beer serving, two-thirds a typical glass of wine and three times more than a serving of a spirit. The company is fighting for more typical serving size details to spare drinkers from doing complicated math in their heads. 201cTo this end, Diageo will work with the EU to establish a standard alcohol unit across the 28 Member States to provide an effective way of communicating alcohol content to consumers, 201d Diageo said.

   "input": "A large labor union is seizing on merger negotiations between Boston Medical Center and Tufts Medical Center as an opportunity to increase its membership among hospital workers. The Service Employees International Union Local 1199 is trying to organize about 1,000 Tufts workers in service, clerical, and technical jobs, from housekeepers to surgical technicians. The union already represents such workers at Boston Medical Center. SEIU 2019s push to organize at Tufts comes as activists around the country prepare to rally Tuesday to urge employers to pay at least $15 an hour. In Boston, the Fight for $15 movement plans to march past universities, property managers, fast food chains, and health care providers. Tufts Medical Center is on the route. Union organizers are using both the Fight for $15 event and merger talks to launch an organizing campaign at Tufts Medical Center. BMC and Tufts have not yet agreed to merge, but they are working to complete a deal this year. The union sent a letter to leaders of the two hospitals, asking them to commit to supporting workers 2019 rights to organize 201cIt 2019s a historic moment for these two vital institutions, 201d said Veronica Turner, executive vice president of 1199SEIU, which includes 52,000 health care workers in Massachusetts. 201cOur goal is to make sure the missions of the hospitals are upheld through the merger process and that workers have a voice in the process. 201d Local 1199 has members at dozens of hospitals and other health care businesses across Massachusetts. In 2009, the union reached an agreement with the former Caritas Christi Health Care -- now Steward Health Care System -- in which the hospital chain agreed not to interfere with workers 2019 efforts to unionize. SEIU later organized workers at several Steward hospitals, including St. Elizabeth 2019s Medical Center and Carney Hospital in Boston. The union is urging Tufts to follow Steward 2019s example and come to a similar agreement. Tufts, so far, has not. The hospital 201chas a long history of working with both non-union and union employees, 201d Tufts vice president Brooke Hynes said in a statement. Hynes said the hospital would include workers in shaping the new health system, should the merger go through. Tufts 2019 workforce includes 1,056 union nurses who belong to the Massachusetts Nurses Association. The nurses union also represents 461 nurses at Boston Medical Center. SEIU has about 2,500 members at Boston Medical Center, including nurses. 201cWe have a positive, collaborative relationship with the unions who represent our workers, including SEIU, and a history of open dialogue that we expect to continue, 201d Jennifer Watson, chief of staff at BMC, said in a statement. Boston and Tufts have discussed a potential merger for months, but have not signed an agreement. Leaders of the hospitals, which both serve large populations of low-income patients, say they could offer an attractive alternative to higher-cost competitors in Boston. They have not detailed how a merger would affect their operations or workforces. Together, the hospitals employ 11,500 people. 201cLike every health care organization in the current environment we would be focused on operating as efficiently as possible, 201d Watson said. She added that a merger would also lead to 201csignificant growth opportunities. 201d Union officials predict a merger will result in layoffs, and they are asking hospital leaders to ensure that affected workers get help for training and job searches. But neither the SEIU nor the Massachusetts Nurses Association are opposing a potential BMC-Tufts merger. 201cWe support the merger so long as it ensures full access to all needed services by the communities these two facilities currently serve, 201d said David Schildmeier, spokesman for the nurses union. As merger talks continue, SEIU is also asking Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh to support workers 2019 rights. 201cCreating quality jobs with good wages is a priority for the city, and therefore a top priority of any possible merger talks, 201d Walsh said in a statement. 201cA fair unionization process is central to achieving the goal of good jobs. 201d  ",

   "input": "IT takes more than $41,000 to earn an undergraduate degree at Yale, but a Briton can get a degree of comparable value at Oxford for virtually no cost at all. The disparity exists because Britain is one of many European countries that offer higher learning cheaply through heavy Government subsidies. While access to higher education in many European countries is on a democratic financial basis, with governments picking up much of the students' tab, stringent scholastic requirements can filter out many potential applicants. In both Britain and Switzerland, stiff academic demands keep the number of students relatively low compared to other European countries. In Italy, on the other hand, virtually anyone who has completed school can spend a few years at a Government-supported institute. In West Germany, for example, tuition for students at any of 284 institutes of higher education is free; students in France pay less than $100 a year to attend that country's 70 state universities, and the Government plans a $2.76 billion higher-education subsidy next year. About half the undergraduates at the University of Geneva in Switzerland pay just $60 a year, and a large proportion of the rest pay no more than $385. Britain expects during this academic year to funnel just over $3.6 billion, almost 2 percent of its annual budget, into its 470 degree-granting institutions. Italy is giving its 52 public universities $1.3 billion this year. In Spain, 30 state universities and four private institutions of higher learning will get a total of $276 million from their government. Low-cost higher education has not always been accessible throughout Europe. In Italy, for example, it was not until 1969, after months of student agitation for ''the right to study,'' that the country's previously elitist institutions were forced by law to lower their costs and open their doors to virtually all students. Six years earlier in Britain, a higher education committee headed by the eminent economist and professor Lord Robbins declared that universities should be made available ''to all who are qualified by ability and attainment to pursue them and wish to do so.'' The concept, known as the ''Robbins principle,'' then became a keystone of Britain's higher education philosophy. But in the last few months many observers of the education scene here have expressed the opinion that the Robbins principle may be in jeopardy. It is widely expected that more than 20,000 and perhaps as many as 50,000 university places will be lost over the next four years because of a cutback of more than 8 percent in Government grants. Taking into account the recent removal of Government subsidies to foreign students, who now have to pay full fees, the overall loss of university resources by 1984 is estimated at between 11 and 15 percent of the current figure. Moreover, 30 polytechnics, which are financed by local authorities and are somewhat like American state universities, may lose 13 percent in subsidies in just one year if proposed cuts are carried out. British students are not alone in their plight. Although every West German who has achieved the necessary scholastic level has a right to attend a university, there are now as many as 50,000 applicants waiting a year or two for admittance. In dentistry, there are seven applicants for each slot. In Italy, students have inundated the state universities, which do not generally restrict admission since study and maintenance grants were introduced in 1969. But because the support grants, called ''presalarios,'' have not risen in 12 years, most students have had to turn to a regional assistance offices for further aid. The ''free,'' or semi-private, universities limit their enrollment through tests and higher costs. In Rome's Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, for example, the medical school this year admitted only 189 of the 722 students who applied. Switzerland's 10 university-level institutions, which are subsidized either by the Government or by the eight cantons, or Swiss states, prevent overcrowding by winnowing students out at a lower level. According to Henry Kerr, an American who teaches at the University of Geneva, ''only the brightest of the bright can survive here because of the severe selection system imposed at the secondary level.'' In Switzerland as in Britain, where tough scholastic standards keep the number of first-year students in universities to only 12 percent of the total, high standards relieve some of the educational headaches. A Swiss student who is renting his living quarters may pay up to $6,800 a year, and maintenance grants in Switzerland are rare. But most undergraduates live at home, commuting short distances to the universities, which provide no housing. In West Germany, by contrast, living support is widely available, though usually in small amounts. The most common source of support is Government aid of as much as $280 a month for a student living away from home, depending among other factors on his family's income. As in Switzerland, no West German universities provide housing. Although Government aid is curtailed once the student's family's income reaches $12,0, there are 10 major institutions - including political parties -and 100 private foundations to which students can turn for support. In Britain and France, student grants are also graduated according to family income and living arrangements, with French students receiving a maximum of $1,500, and those in Britain $2,775 for a year. One reason British maintenance is higher than in many European countries is the difficulty students have getting part-time work. The French students' union estimates that as many as 60 percent of university students have to work at least part-time to manage their expenses. In West Germany the academic year lasts only seven months because students often need five months to finance their education. Could the higher education crisis in Britain be eased by having the students pay their own way, as in private American universities? David Aaronovitch, president of the National Union of Students, doubts it. ''That would be against our tradition,'' he said. ''We have no student loan programs in Britain comparable to those in the United States, partly because we have a different concept of credit. Working people here don't like to be in debt.'' Lord Beloff, who five years ago broke tradition by pioneering Britain's only private institution, the University College of Buckingham, said in an editorial in July that widespread talk of students' rights to higher education in this country was misleading. His students pay nearly $2,000 for each of two years of intensive study. But Simon Ellis, the academic registrar, said in a reference to private universities in the United States that ''the American system is regarded with some horror by many Britons, who feel that is undemocratic.'' ''Education in this country is a right, not a privilege,'' he asserted. This philosophy was underscored in a recent London Times editorial, which commented that ''it defeats the understanding of many, even among the Government's most loyal supporters, why at this time cuts should be imposed'' during record unemployment among young people. More than 100 years ago Benjamin Disraeli told the House of Commons that ''a university should be a place of light, of liberty, and of learning.'' Many still are, but the task of combining low-cost tuition with adequate facilities is proving to be difficult. b Illustrations: photo of Magdalen College  ",

   "input": "T HIS has to do with Martin Luther King, the Marx Brothers and Count Dracula. It has to do with Elvis Presley, Pat Paulsen's run for the Presidency and the ''Human Cannonball.'' It has to do with a Laurel and Hardy wiper blade campaign, and, if carried all the way back to its legal roots, it has something to do with baseball trading cards. What Pat Paulsen's Presidential hankerings have to do with Dracula boils down to a person's so-called right of publicity - that is, his right to cash in on his likeness by licensing furry toys or endorsing toothpaste - and to the fuzzy question of whether this right can be left to heirs, in the way that a house or silverware can. ''The question is whether you can use someone's persona without paying for it,'' says Justin Golenbock of the Golenbock & Barell law firm. The issue has been cast into the spotlight as a result of a flurry of lawsuits seeking to block unauthorized exploitation of celebrities. The ramifications embrace millions of dollars racked up by marketers and producers that may rightfully belong in the banks of heirs. It throws into doubt such tricky matters as whether a company can introduce a Humphrey Bogart cigarette without the go-ahead from the actor's survivors. The answer, according to the courts, is yes, and no, and maybe. A major and controversial ruling came just last month, when a Federal court in Manhattan declared that a Broadway musical called ''A Day in Hollywood A Night in the Ukraine'' violated the right of publicity inherited by relatives of three of the Marx Brothers (Harpo, Groucho and Chico). The musical did so, the court ruled, by including imitations of Marx Brothers routines without permission from the heirs. The concept of a ''right of publicity'' is not new. The actual phrase was first coined in a 1953 case that had to do with rival bubble gum companies that had obtained exclusive agreements to put the mug of New York Giants catcher Wes Westrum on their baseball cards. The court recognized that there was a right of publicity that can be assigned to one bubble gum concern. But while it's long been obvious that everyone has this right, it's gotten increasingly unclear how far it extends or how much protection a star has. There is fairly clear agreement about the scope of protection for the living. A sports-car manufacturer, for instance, can't run an ad featuring Paul Newman without Mr. Newman's assent. Courts made this kind of protection clear as far back as 1907, when Thomas Edison stopped a company from peddling medicinal goods bearing his name. Still, there have been some awfully muddled areas. Some years ago, Goodyear cooked up a campaign for a Wide Boots tire that featured a singer in the background crooning, ''These boots are made for rolling.'' Now, Nancy Sinatra had cut the hit tune, ''These Boots Are Made for Walking.'' She sued. She lost. The judge said the singer was not sufficiently recognizable as Nancy Sinatra. As a stunt, the sour-faced comedian, Pat Paulsen, once declared himself a candidate for President. A company promptly started hawking Pat Paulsen for President posters, without recompensing Mr. Paulsen. He sued. He lost. The court said the First Amendment shields fair comment on a Presidential contender, even one as farfetched as Mr. Paulsen. Where things get truly muddy is when a star is no longer among us. Can fame be inherited? Courts have had trouble making up their minds. The first notable case to treat this question occurred in 1963 in California. Universal Pictures began marketing Count Dracula figurines, jigsaw puzzles and whatnot. Though the vampire's black cape had been donned by an array of actors, the late Bela Lugosi was most commonly linked to the role. Mr. Lugosi's widow and son sued. Eleven years later, they won, only to have the California Supreme Court, in late 1979, topple the ruling, asserting, among other things, that Mr. Lugosi had to have exploited his right of publicity while alive (by licensing T-shirts and other novelties) for it to survive him. The judge felt that he had not. The next big case took a different turn. It involved scalpscratching Stan Laurel and chubby Oliver Hardy. Back in 1960, Larry Harmon Pictures had acquired the comedians' licensing rights. Nonetheless, Hal Roach Studios, which produced the early Laurel and Hardy films, licensed a man named Richard Finer to market Laurel and Hardy wares - toys, ash trays, even a jam. Mr. Harmon, who was the original Bozo the Clown, and the widows of the comedians sued. After all, he recalls Stan Laurel, on his deathbed, telling him: ''Listen, lad, you're going to walk in my shoes now. Don't hurt them or let anybody hurt us or our widows.'' In 1975, a Federal court decided not to hurt them. Since then, Mr. Harmon and his lawyers have been vigilant in guarding the Laurel and Hardy persona. Soon after the ruling, for example, Mr. Harmon learned that Anco was planning a wiper blade ad campaign featuring Laurel and Hardy characters. He quickly interceded and nailed down a license. ''If anyone uses the name Laurel and Hardy anywhere where it involves a right I own,'' Mr. Harmon vows, ''I will be there right in front with my lawyer saying, 'No, no, no, no.' ''  ",

   "input": "The Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, which expired this month, had run through 14 years, five Presidents and $7.7 billion. While it earned a reputation as a bureaucratic white elephant, it was also sadly misunderstood. The L.E.A.A. was created during the Johnson Administration to help state and local criminal justice agencies make law enforcement more effective. The Nixon Administration imposed bolder plans: it promised victory in a war on crime and generously endowed L.E.A.A. to serve as chief supplier of arms and technology. The war lasted only a few years before it became clear that the chance of victory was remote. Crime remained a complex social problem, stubbornly resistant to SWAT teams and computer-equipped patrol cars. L.E.A.A. turned back to a research path - only to discover a mortal problem. The Nixon era oratory had pumped up expectations. If L.E.A.A. couldn't reduce crime, people wanted to know, what good was it? Boondoggle stories didn't help. One famous L.E.A.A. study actually sought to determine why convicts want to get out of prison. But news that the agency had wasted large sums, and the attendant derision, obscured a more important point. Whatever it did not do, L.E.A.A. advanced public understanding of criminal justice out of kindergarten and through some primary grades. Until the publication of President Johnson's crime commission report in 1967, and L.E.A.A.'s establishment a year later, few people had recognized how much criminal justice is a ''hydraulic'' system in which solving a problem at one level (tougher sentences) may only displace it to another (crowded prisons). L.E.A.A. projects discovered that the number of police officers on patrol may have little to do with the amount of crime, demonstrated the value of prosecutors focusing on ''career criminals,'' found ways to reduce court delays and developed a range of community programs for convicts. None of the applied research necessarily reduced crime. Even the soundest new approach may only deal with a small part of the problem, and then only when carried out on a scale that can challenge traditional political and economic barriers. But using crime rates to validate such activity is unfair. Crime rises and falls with broad economic, demographic and cultural trends. Criminal justice agencies may never defeat it; their task is to hold the line, without sacrificing their own commitments to fairness and decency. During the L.E.A.A. years, that task was especially difficult. Funds for criminal justice declined even as fear of crime rose, putting ever more pressure on the police, prosecutors, courts and prisons. In such a bind, the criminal justice agencies were well served by the fresh ideas and management tools developed by L.E.A.A. The Reagan Administration, preoccupied with deficits and inclined to duck the crime issue, may prefer to remember L.E.A.A. boondoggles. But the successes demonstrated that Washington can in fact do much to help local law enforcement. Not many police departments would have developed rape squads without leadership and encouragement from L.E.A.A. Few communities could have found the resources to set up programs for victims. The best Federal role is to help localities conduct and apply criminal justice research, with its powerful implications for management. L.E.A.A. may be dead, but the need for such help is greater than ever.  ",

   "input": "NEW HAVEN IN a comfortable, Victorian-vintage dwelling on the Yale campus, lawyers, sociologists and university students are investigating what they say is perhaps the least understood aspect of American society - the behavior of hundreds of thousands of educational, scientific, cultural or civic groups operating as nonprofit organizations. These organizations - their ranks include schools, museums, libraries, antipoverty agencies, hospitals and garden clubs - are collectively referred to as the independent or voluntary sector. ''The nonprofits have been a nonsubject for American scholars,'' said Prof. John G. Simon, who has directed the undertaking since it began four years ago. The Yale program on nonprofit organizations is the only one of its kind in the country, although it has spun off a few related research ventures at other universities. The program, conducted within the Institute for Social and Policy Studies at Yale, also has working relations with scholars in 11 countries. Until recently, the work of the researchers moved along at a leisurely pace and, as Professor Simon acknowledged, had gone largely unnoticed by government, business or the philanthropic community. But in the last few months interest has quickened as a result of President Reagan's budget cuts in spending for welfare, education and the arts, which have sent nonprofit organizations working in these fields scurrying to find alternative financing. The impact of these developments on the nonprofit community was a recurrent theme recently when Professor Simon and his program participants came together for a brown-bag luncheon discussion, or, the way he describes it, a ''show-and-tell hour.'' As resources, the nonprofits can expect there will be a greater demand for their services, said Professor Simon, underscoring that the next few months are likely to see community leaders trying to pull together information on local needs. Business leaders in Stamford, for example, have asked members of the program to help conduct an audit of the human resource needs of that city. One side effect of the budget developments has been to underscore the scarcity of reliable data about the nonprofit sector as a whole, including how it is supported or operated and its relations to government and to the community. As far as scholars are concerned, it has been the ''dark side of the moon,'' said Professor Simon. Even the dimensions of the sector are uncertain. There are at least 800,000 nonprofit organizations that report to the Government and are accorded tax exemptions. But there are many more that do not seek exemption, or operate as informal neighborhood aid groups or are formed only to work during an emergency and are then dissolved. The total around the country may run into the millions, according to Professor Simon. The Yale program is an attempt to uncover as much reliable data as possible and also to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the sector, and it is hoped lead to its more effective functioning. From a modest beginning, the program has grown into 112 separate inquiries engaging the energies of 140 researchers. The study was initially launched with a $253,000 gift from the late John D. Rockefeller 3d, and contributions from 17 foundation or company donors for a total of $2 million. five-year cycle. To date, 44 studies have been completed and others are nearing the final stage. One recent report has furnished the first in-depth inquiry into the economic significance of the nonprofit groups. It was undertaken by Gabriel Rudney, an economist on leave from the United States Treasury Department, who documented the growth of nonprofit activities, showing that the sector has become a major contributor to the economy. Among other findings, he concluded that the philanthropic sector spent $129.2 billion in 1980, a total exceeding the budgets of every country except the United States, France, West Germany, Britain, Japan, China and the Soviet Union. The philanthropic sector employed 5.6 million workers, more than either the construction or automotive industries. It spent $42.6 billion to purchase goods and services. Some other areas of inquiry under the Yale program are the operations of public broadcasting, the role of nonprofit groups on human rights questions and the impact of public funding on the arts. In addition, researchers are looking into the issue of fund-raising abuses and assessing the potential of corporate philanthropy to assist the financially threatened nonprofit groups. The Yale scholars are breaking ground in a number of areas likely to prove controversial. An inquiry by Susan Rose-Ackerman, a Yale faculty member, is looking into the growing practice by nonprofit organizations of turning to income-producing ventures to augment their resources. She has examined the trend among museums to open gift shops and universities to engage in profitable research projects. Some groups are even running travel services - all activities that seem to blur the line between nonprofit and forprofit operations. The pattern is leading to growing protests that nonprofit groups enjoying tax-exemption, favorable postal rates and other benefits are competing unfairly with business. Those engaged in the Yale program are encouraged to present the facts as they find them and not to be concerned about causing controversies. A case in point was the publication of a study by Robert Clark, a former member of the Yale law faculty, who questioned whether there should be nonprofit hospitals. He concluded that voluntary hospitals were ''elitist,'' saying they tended ''to frustrate both political ideals of consumer participation and economic ideals of rational, coordinated policymaking about health care.'' This brought a response from the American Hospital Association that was less than enthusiastic. Professor Simon himself has insisted that the free-inquiry rule be observed consistently. On one occasion, his own view supporting the Federal tax system of allowing charitable deductions for itemizing taxpayers drew objections from a former law student who contended the practice favored an elite group. Professor Simon agreed but defended the practice on other grounds. He also decided the challenger deserved an opportunity to prove his case and arranged that the Yale program sponsor and pay the costs so the rebuttal could be properly researched.

   "input": "A roster of today 2019s hottest startups would have to include Airbnb and Uber, which allow anyone to become a hotelier or chauffeur, and Pinterest, which lets you create virtual pinboards tied to topics you care about. SpaceX has visions of becoming the FedEx and JetBlue of outer space. Dropbox makes it easy to store files online and get access to them from any device, and Snapchat lets you send photos that are visible only for a short of time. Two threads connect that circle of startups, all of which are privately held and have valuations of $10 billion or more. The first is skepticism that the profit potential of these disruptors justifies the sky-high valuations. Investors, for example, think Airbnb is currently worth $24 billion. Can a website for renting vacation homes and spare bedrooms really be more valuable than Marriott, with a $20 billion market capitalization and more than 3,700 hotels around the world? The second thread is Boston 2019s Fidelity Investments, whose mutual funds own shares in each of them. Fidelity is either helping its shareholders get in on the next Facebook 2014 whose stock Fidelity bought before the social network landed on the Nasdaq exchange 2014 or helping pump up a new bubble in the tech industry. Or a bit of both. It 2019s not hard to find media reports expressing shock at discovering that mutual funds like Fidelity, Janus, and T. Rowe Price are buying chunks of risky startups, a couple hundred million dollars at a time. But rules set by the Securities and Exchange Commission allow stock in private companies to compose up to 15 percent of a mutual fund. Fidelity says its house rules limit those holdings to 10 percent. The job of a mutual fund manager is to hunt for better-than-average returns, and the reason some Fidelity funds are buying shares of these companies is simple, says Andy Boyd, head of global equity capital markets at Fidelity. Tech companies are waiting longer to go public, and if you sit on the sidelines until the initial public offering, you 2019ll have missed out on much of the appreciation of their value. How do these deals go down? Sometimes, the companies or their venture capitalists approach Fidelity. Other times, Fidelity initiates discussions after its analysts identify fast-growing private companies that don 2019t have comparable peers in the public stock markets. Boyd said his group tries to get in on young companies that have the potential to be 201clong-term winners 201d by creating new marketplaces or software platforms that could endure for decades. He sets up meetings with the management teams, often in Boston so that Fidelity fund managers can pepper the executives with questions. Fidelity makes several dozen investments in private companies each year, with individual fund managers ultimately making the decisions about whether to buy shares of a Dropbox or a Pinterest. Boyd asserts that Fidelity is conservative about the price it will pay for shares; there 2019s always plenty of internal debate about whether a given company has what it takes to succeed over the long haul. 201cIf the price is too high, we just don 2019t buy it, 201d he says. Instead, Fidelity may choose to wait until the IPO or later. The day before I spoke with Boyd, one of Fidelity 2019s private holdings, SpaceX, suffered a setback when one of its cargo rockets exploded en route to the International Space Station. Isn 2019t a rocket-building startup that plans to put humans on Mars by 2026 the classic example of a high-risk venture? He compared SpaceX to Fidelity 2019s initial $74 million investment in Facebook, which people thought might be a passing fad with limited revenue potential. (Fidelity today owns more than $5 billion of Facebook shares.) 201cTen years from now, we 2019ll have another conversation 201d about SpaceX, Boyd says. Todd Dagres is a founder of Spark Capital, a Boston venture capital firm that was an early backer of companies like Twitter and Wayfair, the home goods e-commerce site. Private company valuations, he says, may have sprinted too far ahead of public companies, based on revenues and cash flow. But Dagres says timing is everything: 201cInvestors that get in early tend to do well as momentum builds and private company valuations take off. 201d Those who join in closer to the end of a boom cycle 201cget their heads handed to them, 201d Dagres says, and are left holding illiquid assets that plummet in value. 201cAre we there yet? Probably. 201d Boyd says that Fidelity has been looking at more private investments, but getting more selective, in part because valuations have continued to rise. 201cOur hit rate has gone down, 201d he says. Boyd believes we 2019ll have reached the peak of this current boom when Fidelity stops making these investments, 201cbecause everything will be priced ridiculously. 201d Most Fidelity funds own none of these young, private companies, spokesman Charles Keller says. For the funds that do, private shares represent 1 or 2 percent of their total assets. Still, funds like Fidelity 2019s Blue Chip Growth own more stock in Uber than they do in stalwarts like Boeing Co. or Bank of America Corp. (Fidelity doesn 2019t disclose what it pays per share when it buys into private companies, though it does report estimates of the value of each mutual fund 2019s holdings in monthly reports.) If you buy shares in Fidelity 2019s Contrafund, you 2019ve got more exposure to Dropbox, which was founded in Cambridge before it moved to San Francisco, than Dunkin 2019 Brands Group Inc. of Canton. And if investors care about how much Fidelity and other mutual companies are putting into startups? Well, it 2019s easy to read the complete list of a fund 2019s holdings before you buy in.  ",

Fiscally-disciplined Germany has been pushing austerity as a way to bring the euro zone's economy back on track, making Berlin the target of Greek anger from both the public and politicians. Conversely, the German public are angry at what they see as insults and ingratitude from Greece when they have been the country's largest euro zone creditor.

As such, the prospect of the Grexit has returned to the fore , according to Daniele Antonucci, European economist at Morgan Stanley. Contrary to many commentators , we don't think that the probability of a euro exit has diminished, Antonucci said in a note Tuesday , adding that Morgan Stanley put the probability of a Grexit at one in four over the next six months.

The chance to see a quick compromise has diminished. Read MoreGreece lashes out as pressure to reform rises The economic and financial tensions have been matched by an increasingly frosty political atmosphere as Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' appears to becoming increasingly isolated in Europe. The Greek government faces a dire financial situation in the coming weeks , especially as lenders are unlikely to relent on the conditions of last month's loan extension, Wolfango Piccoli , managing director of risk consultancy Teneo Intelligence said in a note Tuesday. Leaving aside the cash crunch challenge , the government's nationalist strategy is setting the stage for a period of intense turmoil and uncertainty, he added , saying that Tsipras' lack of experience in power was starting to show as he faces a divided party at home and isolation abroad. Tsipras will raise the issue of increasing the amount of cash available in Greece's economy at his meetings with top European Union leaders at the margins of this week's summit in Brussels, the government's spokesman told Reuters Wednesday. Despite this difficult outlook and recent toughening rhetoric on all sides , there was still an appetite to keep Greece in the euro zone, Piccoli noted, saying a euro exit is still unlikely (20 percent probability). Greece frustrated its main creditors further on Tuesday by refusing to update euro zone peers on its reform progress at a scheduled teleconference , according to a Reuters report, insisting instead that the discussions should be escalated to a European Union (EU) summit scheduled for Thursday. Showing that patience with Greece is running thin, the EU's financial affairs chief said in a newspaper interview on Wednesday that the EU is not prepared to keep Greece in the euro zone at any price, although he said that a Greek exit would inflict great damage on the currency union. The Eurogroup (of euro zone finance ministers) has an overwhelming will to keep Greece in the euro zone , Pierre Moscovici , the financial affairs chief, told German daily Die Welt.

Pew polled 1,692 adults in the U.S., as well as 1,700 in Germany and 1,516 in Italy. Pew researchers were looking at how families in different countries support the elderly. Only 24 percent of Americans said the government should bear the greatest responsibility for people's economic well-being in their old age compared with 48 percent of Germans and 58 percent of Italians. That the elderly should bear the greatest responsibility for their own economic well-being was the most popular answer in the U.S. with 31 percent of Americans agreeing with the statement while 28 percent of Germans and just 4 percent of Italians concurred.

The charges served as counterpoint to other police killings of unarmed black men over the past year in cities including Ferguson , Missouri, and New York, where authorities cleared the officers involved. Those cases also led to sometimes violent demonstrations across the country.

He and three others also face a charge of involuntary manslaughter and all must further answer to other lesser charges.

In fact, Cramer would argue that the biotech group has gone from being hit or miss to being totally predictable just based on what the CEOs are saying on Mad Money. For instance , BioMarin racked up a 12 percent gain after a successful trial of a drug that combats dwarfism in children. The results of the trial triggered price target bumps from all of the research houses that follow the stock. Cramer was shocked when he saw this. Not because of the results of the study, but the fact that these results seemed to be much of a surprise in the first place. BioMarin CEO J.J.

But most importantly , when looking back at all of these CEO interviews, Cramer saw a pattern.

   "input": "Sometimes a small book with a limited number of pictures can be a better way into an artist's work than a large one, particularly when it comes with notes from the artist himself. Since the early 1960s, William Christenberry has made paintings, drawings, sculptures, installations and photographs inspired by the landscape and history contained within a small stretch of land between Hale and Perry Counties in his native Alabama. In its intensity, and the way he returns again and again to familiar objects and familiar territory, Christenberry's approach is reminiscent of Morandi, or even C 00e9zanne. Periodically Christenberry has spoken about the motivations behind his work, about the importance of his family history, and of his sense of deep attachment to the places where he photographs. Now these texts have been collected and edited by the writer and curator Susanne Lange into a book of stories, which, with photographs of some of his most seminal pieces, provides a narrative to over 40 years of work. When art historians discuss the way artists use photography as references for other works, to record scenes they have staged, or as an inquiry into the nature of photography itself, they often cite Ed Ruscha, Gerhard Richter, or Cindy Sherman. Less frequently do they mention Christenberry, who began to make small colour photographs with a box Brownie camera as a reference for his artworks when he was studying painting at the University of Alabama in the 1950s. In those days Christenberry was influenced by abstract expressionism, and the photographs were less figurative models than spiritual markers, part of an attempt, he said, to come to grips with my feelings about the landscape and what was in it. He had no interest in photography as a craft and developed his films at the local drugstore. Colour photography , in any case, was considered vulgar by serious art photographers who, with rare exceptions, avoided it. Christenberry was born in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, in 1936, the same year that Walker Evans and the writer James Agee spent a month in nearby Hale County, living with three white tenant farming families, researching an article for Fortune magazine. When it failed to run the article, Evans and Agee turned the research into a book, published in 1941, called Let Us Now Praise Famous Men. It was republished in 1960, by which time it was acknowledged as a documentary masterpiece, and it was perhaps this edition that Christenberry saw in a bookshop in Birmingham, Alabama, that year. It was a book that changed his outlook entirely. He recognised not only the places, and some of the people, but more importantly he realized the strength of the emotional links he felt to the landscape it described: the old wooden buildings, simple churches, storefronts, billboards and signs he had grown up with. He went back to Hale County and photographed what he could find from Evans and Agee's trip 25 years before. The memory of a building in one of Evans's photographs inspired a painting, Tenant House 1 (1960). Though it suggested De Kooning's influence, it was recognisably a building, with a black roof and windows and a gaping black hole for a door. It turned him away from abstract expressionism and set him on a path he has barely deviated from ever since. What the stories in this new collection make clear is how Christenberry's subject matter has developed and deepened over time. From small colour photographs came paintings and drawings and, later, three-dimensional miniature constructions, called dream buildings because the first one was inspired by a dream (I got up and I thought to myself that if Jasper Johns , an artist I respect very much, dreamed that he painted the American flag, and then did it, I could make my dream building, he wrote). In 1977 , Christenberry's friend Lee Friedlander suggested he try using a large-format 8x 10 view camera on a tripod. Since then he has used the camera to make more formally composed photographs , and in turn this has given them a more dominant role in his work. Yet Christenberry's subjects remain rooted in the same territory: basic, functional buildings, mostly of wood, as well as old metal signs and billboards, which he collects and sometimes incorporates into his works. In certain cases he has made photographic typologies of the same building, which, shown together, illustrate the gradual changes, in colour, patina and structure which mark the passing of time, and signify the shift from reality to memory. With repetition, the basic shapes of these buildings become iconic. The Green Warehouse (Newbern, Alabama, 1978) is a corrugated iron-clad building with a central pitched roof and two lower, sloping roofs extending on either side, shaped like a stealth bomber. The Red Building in Forest (Hale County, Alabama, 1983) was once a one-room schoolhouse and looks like a child's drawing of a house without windows. It is clad in red-brick-patterned asphalt sheeting, including the door. Sprott Church, between Selma and Marion, is a lonely little white church with 2026 two towers , which he has known since childhood. In 1974 he began to build a version of it in his studio. In 2005 he made a second version. The real church and the landscape do not look at all like they did years ago , he explains. But I want to keep them as memories 2026 Some day I hope they will be seen side by side. It sometimes seems that , by reworking the same territory, Christenberry creates his own dynamic circle, inside which strange coincidences can occur. Even the titles of his photographs - the House Built by Man with One Arm; the House Painted Only as High as One could reach; the Palmist Building - have a fabulous ring to them. But there is another aspect of his work, still rooted in the south, which is altogether more sinister and surprising. One evening in 1960, in Tuscaloosa, Christenberry decided to go to a meeting of the Ku Klux Klan. Halfway up a dimly lit staircase in the local courthouse, he saw a Klansman in full robe and hood standing guard on the landing above. He didn't move, but their eyes met for a few moments before the photographer turned and ran. Soon afterwards, Christenberry began work on an installation which is still evolving: it includes Klan dolls, Klan paintings, drawings and other objects, laid out in a separate room, lit with eerie red light, which reflects his lifelong hatred of the racism, prejudice and violence that the Klan represents. In little over a hundred pages, this modest book provides an entry to an entire world. It includes stories about his friends, including Walker Evans, whom he first met in New York in 1961, and William Eggleston, whom he met after he went to teach in Memphis in 1962. At that time Eggleston was still photographing in black-and-white. He was interested in and supportive of my little Brownie snapshots , Christenberry recalls. Our involvement with colour photography developed early on. In 1968 , Christenberry became professor of drawing and painting at the Corcoran College of Art in Washington DC, where he has lived ever since. But every year he returns to Alabama to work. It was on one such trip, a journey to Hale County in October 1973, that he took Walker Evans with him. It was the first time Evans had been back since 1936. He is just visible at the edge of one of Christenberry's pictures of an old green clapboard house, with a palm-reader's sign at the window, the wrong way up. Christenberry had photographed the building for years 2013 it had once been his great-uncle Sydney's general store 2013 and he would return to photograph it again every year as it collapsed and finally disappeared. Since then, he has returned to photograph the site where it once stood. It is a story that captures the significance of Christenberry's work: his commitment to place. It is a rare and valuable quality in an atomised world, and it gives his work a depth that is reinforced by reiteration.  ",

Mogherini said the so-called elections in eastern Ukraine were illegal and illegitimate and would not be recognised by the EU. There was a risk they could end chances for rebel dialogue with Kiev and dialogue between Kiev and Moscow , she said.

Between a raucous rally inside the State House and a march to a nearby McDonald 2019s, several workers testified in front of the Joint Committee on Labor and Workforce Development, whose cochairman, state Senator Daniel Wolf, is the sponsor of the $15-an-hour act. Dunkin 2019 Donuts worker Theresa Pennington said that a pay bump to $15 an hour would help her save enough money to get her own place in hopes of regaining custody of her 5-year-old daughter. Dan Burke, a server at Temple Bar in Cambridge, spoke in favor of a bill that would do away with the tipped minimum wage, raising wait staff from $3 to $9 an hour. A woman wearing a Dunkin 2019 Donuts visor joined the crowd of protesters during the rally and march. One Dunkin 2019 employee said a pay bump would bolster her savings.

During a meeting with Obama at the White House, Joko Widodo risked the ire of economic nationalists at home and pledged to join the pact. Indonesia is an open economy and with a population of 250 million , we are the largest economy in Southeast Asia, Widodo said in the Oval Office on Monday. Indonesia intends to join the TPP. Twelve countries are currently party to the Trans-Pacific Partnership - including Australia , Canada, Japan, Mexico, Vietnam and the United States - creating the world's largest free trade area. The deal is seen by some as a counterbalance to growing Chinese economic clout in the region. Widodo's endorsement is a political victory for Obama, who is steering the already completed pact through a hostile Republican-controlled Congress and without the full backing of his Democratic party. Hillary Clinton, the 2016 election frontrunner, has said the deal falls short of the high bar she had set for helping US interests. Obama has claimed the TPP has the strongest labour and environmental standards of any trade deal signed by the United States. Widodo's comments will also raise hopes that he will help catalyse the world's most populous Muslim nation , allowing Indonesia to finally punch its weight. Sketching out a key strategic partnership Obama - who lived in Indonesia for nearly five years as a child - said the US needed good relations with Jakarta. Obviously I have a very personal interest in Indonesia , given the fact that I spent a bit of time there as a child and have relatives who are Indonesian, Obama said. But what is also true is that our partnership is very much in the interests of the United States , given Indonesia's large population, its leadership in the region, its democratic traditions, the fact that it is a large Muslim country with a tradition of tolerance and moderation, and its role in trade and commerce and economic development. Widodo's visit to the White House was the first by an Indonesian president in a decade and came exactly a year after the former furniture salesman became president. In the Oval Office , Obama offered his own endorsement, praising the economic reform efforts of a fellow 54-year-old who, like him, swept to power as an outsider promising change. Indonesia's notoriously protectionist economy has been stymied by systemic corruption, lower commodity prices and China's economic slowdown. Unemployment among the vast ranks of Indonesia's youth stands at more than 20 per cent, and efforts to attract investors have been undercut by economic nationalism, vested interests and red tape.  ",

Strauss once described Wagner 2019s 201cTristan und Isolde 201d in similar terms. He saw it as one of a select few works 201cthat reveal the most exalted truths of the soul, which are not 2018invented, 2019 but are 2018lent in a dream 2019 to those favored with them. 201d In preparing his Tristan-inspired song cycle 201cLove Fail 201d 2014 which was performed with cool clarity and superb skill by the Lorelei Ensemble at the Gardner Museum on Sunday afternoon 2014 the composer David Lang spent time researching the Tristan myth and culling moments from its retellings by writers as disparate as B 00e9roul, Gottfried von Strasburg, Marie de France, and of course Wagner. To form his libretto, Lang adapted their poetry and prose with his own words, and then interpolated brief short stories by Lydia Davis. The vocal settings Lang then fashioned for his 15 songs manage to ring with both ancient and modern sensibilities. This helps confer a sense of through-line even as the antique truths expressed, for instance, by the 15th-century English writer Sir Thomas Malory ( 201cthe joy of love is too short, and the sorrow thereof, and what cometh thereof, dureth over long 201d) open onto the sharp-eyed contemporary prose of Davis, whose words in the very next song (titled 201cA Different Man 201d) describe the play of distance and intimacy hidden beneath the surface of a modern romantic partnership. In this way, centuries of Tristanesque meditations are enfolded in a world of dreamlike and almost incantatory music. 201cLove Fail 201d was originally composed for the vocal quartet Anonymous 4, which recently disbanded after decades of accomplished music-making. It was a wise move for Lang to create an expanded choral arrangement, which here received its first performance. There is now a fullness to the sound achieved without altering the work 2019s sense of ritual austerity. It also could not have hurt that the Lorelei Ensemble, its members standing in a circle and led by artistic director Beth Willer, performed the new arrangement on Sunday with impeccable musicality and pure-voiced precision. Ultimately, for a score about tragic love, the sense of pathos in Lang 2019s music does not emerge as one might expect. It certainly does not rush at you like, for instance, the passion and unsublimated yearning of the 201cPrelude und Liebestod 201d from Wagner 2019s 201cTristan. 201d It does not even surface per se through any one individual song. Rather, it builds slowly through this cycle 2019s consolatory sense of repetition, its coolly hypnotic meditations on cycles of love and loss which turn out to be as ancient, and as dependable, as the tides.

   "input": "Spotify founder Daniel Ek. (AAP) Music streaming service Spotify netted $3 billion revenue last year but is still in the red, according to its earnings report. The report revealed the Swedish company's losses deepened last year, even as its revenue increased amid the global boom in online music. Spotify was founded in 2008 and has been at the forefront of the music industry's turn to streaming, which offers unlimited music on demand, yet it has never turned a profit itself. The Luxembourg-based holding company Spotify Technologies submitted its annual earnings report yesterday, and said its revenue jumped 80 per cent to 1.95 billion euros (AU$3.03 billion) last year. The growth rate is significantly stronger than the 45 per cent it charted in 2014 and slightly higher than the 74 percent seen in 2013. In many ways , it was our best year ever, the company said in a message to shareholders , describing Spotify as the top driver of growth for the entire music industry. The company said its revenue from advertisements nearly doubled and that its user base also grew significantly. Spotify said it had 89 million active monthly users by the end of last year, up from 60 million in 2014. It had 28 million subscribers, who were paying for the service. The company's founder, Daniel Ek, had said in March that Spotify reached 30 million paying subscribers. But the growth did not erase losses, with Spotify putting a priority on investments at a stage when streaming is increasingly becoming mainstream. The company's net losses totaled 173 million euros (AU$268 million), nearly seven per cent more than a year before. We believe our model supports profitability at scale , the company said. We believe that we will generate substantial revenues as our reach expands and that , at scale, our margins will improve. We will therefore continue to invest relentlessly in our product and marketing initiatives to accelerate reach. Spotify's growth is all the more remarkable as last year marked a pause in its international expansion. It resumed its global push this year , adding Indonesia as its 59th country. But Spotify also faces growing competition - tech giant Apple launched its own streaming service last year and rap mogul Jay-Z has spearheaded rival Tidal, adding to a market that also includes French-based Deezer and US-based Rhapsody. Deezer's revenue stood at 142 million euros (AU$220 million)in 2014, well below Spotify. The company, which put off a market listing in October, has not released figures for last year. Apple does not break down its revenue from streaming. Rhapsody, which also operates as Napster, posted US$202 million (AU$279 million) in revenue last year. Spotify has sought to expand its offerings, starting video content and recently launching a tie-up in the US with Starbucks aimed at bringing in new subscribers. But it has also faced prominent holdouts including Taylor Swift, Adele and Radiohead, who have kept some or all of their music off the service, in part due to objections to its free tier. The soaring growth of subscriptions to Spotify and its rivals led the global music industry to post significant growth for the first time in nearly two decades last year, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. But with an accompanying fall in sales of CDs and digital downloads, some players in the music industry wonder whether streaming will offer healthy margins in the long term. Spotify remains a private company under the control of its founders, Ek and fellow Swede Martin Lorentzon, and has financed its commercial push on its own through investors. A listed shareholder, Swedish telecom firm Telia, last year made it known that Spotify was valued at US$8.2 billion (AU$11.3 billion).  ",

   "input": "TIME passes. Jane Jacobs, the great lover of cities who stared down Robert Moses' bulldozers and saved many of New York's most precious neighborhoods, died last week at 89. It is a loss for those who value urban life. But her death may also give us permission to move on, to let go of the obsessive belief that Ms. Jacobs held the answer to every evil that faces the contemporary city. Don Hogan Charles The New York Times BIG BUT NOT BAD The plaza at Lincoln Center, silence amid chaos. For New Yorkers, Ms. Jacobs's life remains suspended between two seismic events: The publication, in 1961, of The Death and Life of Great American Cities and her showdown in the late 60's with Mr. Moses over a proposed Lower Manhattan Expressway that would have reduced much of SoHo's handsome cast-iron district to rubble. The expressway was killed by Mayor John V. Lindsay in 1969. By then , Ms. Jacobs had fled for Toronto, and Mr. Moses, who died in 1981, had lost much of his power and prestige. But in the popular imagination, the two are forever at odds: the imperious city planning czar versus the tireless public advocate. Today, the pendulum of opinion has swung so far in favor of Ms. Jacobs that it has distorted the public's understanding of urban planning. As we mourn her death, we may want to mourn a bit for Mr. Moses as well. Her argument was simple enough, radically so. Horrified at the tabula rasa urban renewal strategies of the 1950's, she argued for a return to the small-scale city she found in Greenwich Village and the North End of Boston 0097 the lively street life of front stoops, corner shops and casual personal interaction. Mr. Moses, tellingly, once dismissed her and her ilk as nobody but a bunch of mothers. He was partly right. By standing up for the intricate , individual relationships that define the inner life of cities, she allowed a generation to challenge the authority of patronizing 0097 and uniformly male 0097 city planners in gray suits. An urban fl 00e2neur of the first order, she reminded us that cities could only be fully understood with our eyes, feet and ears 0097 not from the distant abstraction of architectural drawings. But the problems of the 20th-century city were vast and complicated. Ms. Jacobs had few answers for suburban sprawl or the nation's dependence on cars, which remains critical to the development of American cities. She could not see that the same freeway that isolated her beloved, working-class North End from downtown Boston also protected it from gentrification. And she never understood cities like Los Angeles, whose beauty stems from the heroic scale of its freeways and its strange interweaving of man-made and natural environments. The threats facing the contemporary city are not what they were when she first formed her ideas, now nearly 50 years ago. The activists of Ms. Jacobs's generation may have saved SoHo from Mr. Moses' bulldozers, but they could not stop it from becoming an open-air mall. The old buildings are still there, the streets are once again paved in cobblestone, but the rich mix of manufacturers, artists and gallery owners has been replaced by homogenous crowds of lemming-like shoppers. Nothing is produced there any more. It is a corner of the city that is nearly as soulless, in its way, as the superblocks that Ms. Jacobs so reviled. Nor did Ms. Jacobs really offer an adequate long-term solution for the boom in urban population, which cannot be solved simply through incremental growth in existing neighborhoods. Just as cities change, so do our perceptions of them. Architects now in their mid-40's 0097 Ms. Jacobs's age when she published Death and Life 0097 do not share their parents' unqualified hatred of Modernist developments. They understand that an endless grid of brick towers and barren plazas is dehumanizing. But on an urban island packed with visual noise , the plaza at Lincoln Center 0097 or even at the old World Trade Center 0097 can be a welcome contrast in scale, a moment of haunting silence amid the chaos. Similarly, the shimmering glass towers that frame lower Park Avenue are awe-inspiring precisely because they offer a sharp contrast to the quiet tree-lined streets of the Upper East Side. Perhaps her legacy has been most damaged by those who continue to treat Death and Life as sacred text rather than as what it was: a heroic cri de coeur. Of those , the New Urbanists are the most guilty; in many cases, they reduced her vision of corner shops and busy streets to a superficial town formula that creates the illusion of urban diversity, but masks a stifling uniformity at its core. This is true in large-scale projects as diverse as Battery Park City or Celebration, Fla., where narrow streets and parks were supposed to create an immediate sense of community. As it turns out, what the New Urbanists could not reproduce was the most critical aspect of Ms. Jacobs's vision, the intimate neighborhood that is built 0097 brick by brick, family by family 0097 over a century. For those who could not see it, the hollowness of this urban planning strategy was finally exposed in New Orleans, where planners were tarting up historic districts for tourists, even as deeper social problems were being ignored and its infrastructure was crumbling. The answer to such superficiality is not to resurrect the spirit of Robert Moses. But in retrospect his vision, however flawed, represented an America that still believed a healthy government would provide the infrastructure 0097 roads, parks, bridges 0097 that binds us into a nation. Ms. Jacobs, at her best, was fighting to preserve the more delicate bonds that tie us to a community. A city, to survive and flourish, needs both perspectives. The lesson we should take from Ms. Jacobs was her ability to look at the city with her eyes wide open, without rigid prejudices. Maybe we should see where that lesson leads next.  ",

   "input": "You've finally bought a little patch of Mother Earth that you can call your own. Then you discover your neighbor is encroaching. Perhaps his fence is two feet over the property line, or the dying limb of his sugar maple is overhanging your garage, or his barking dog is keeping you up all night. How can you deal with such encroachments? First, let's clarify a couple of terms. An easement is a right of access that has been agreed-upon by the property owner, in writing, or mandated by a government decision. Perhaps the first owner of your house granted your neighbor access to a dock on your property in perpetuity, or the city has retained an easement to access power lines that run across the back border of your property. If the easement is recorded, you don't have much recourse. An encroachment is tresspass without permission, and you can do something about it. If your neighbor has taken a few feet of your land when building his fence, you can take steps to take back your land. A caveat, however; make sure you know where your true property boundaries are. For example: the back edge of my property is fenced, and the fence has a four-foot jog where two abutting properties meet. When I moved in, my neighbor told me that one of those landowners had moved his fence to take four feet of my land before I moved in, and I intended to require him to move it back. To my chagrin, when the property was surveyed, I found that the previous owner of my house had, in fact, taken four feet of my neighbor's property. If you are confident about the borders of your property, you could approach your neighbor and politely request that he honor these lines. Property owners often become unreasonably confident that the customary boundaries reflect their title, though, so sharing the survey information could help greatly in this discussion. Also, modern surveying techniques are much more accurate than older methods, so in comparing property titles there may be some overlap. These inaccuracies are usually settled by dividing the land in question. You should also be aware of the laws of adverse possession. If a person has used a portion of your land for a period of time, as identified by state law, he could claim title to it when the statute of limitations for ejection has passed. This often protects fences built off the property boundaries. At this point, consulting an attorney is money well spent. According to Consumer Reports, should a neighbor's tree limb falls on your house, obtaining a satisfactory settlement often depends on your ability to prove that your neighbor knew and ignored the hazard. If you see the potential for such a problem, take an escalating approach to head it off, documenting each step. Politely express your concern to your neighbor. If he disagrees, offer to share the cost of bringing in a tree surgeon or other professional for an opinion. If your neighbor doesn't respond, follow up with a politely written letter reiterating your concern. Document both. Take photos of the subject of your concern. Consult your insurer to determine coverage should the limb fall on your house. If the worst does come to pass, you still might have to go to small claims court to get satisfaction. There, your documentation should serve you well. Noise encroachment is perhaps the most common inspiration for a neighborhood war. To combat it, first familiarize yourself with the local regulations. Make sure you aren't also violating code with your leaf-blower or lawnmower. Then talk to other neighbors. If they are similarly put out, one of you should approach the transgressor as a representative of the group. This might convince them to address the problem. Keep in mind that they may not even be aware that the dog is yapping or their child's 50 Cent tunes can be heard two states away. Here, a recording might come in handy, and most of us have the capability, with our cell phones, to record the sounds. If your neighbor is unresponsive, begin a journal of sounds and times. You may discover that the occasions are infrequent, and your best route to neighborhood peace is to live and let live. If calling the cops seems like your only remaining option, make sure that you have recordings, your log, names of like-minded neighbors and details of the transgressions ready for the officer, to prove that you aren't a grouch with unreasonable expectations. Don't stand on your stoop and watch the cop call the neighbor to task; this will only cause more resentment. And for God's sake, don't take your frustrations out on the dog. It is barking for a reason, and that reason is that your neighbor is not treating it properly. All of these problems are more easily dealt with when neighbors are familiar with one another, so a block party or similar ice-breaker can pay enormously in avoiding a street war. So think about meeting your neighbors there, rather than waiting until you're mad enough to spit.  ",

   "input": "Illustration by Goran Factory for Fortune Of all the Silicon Valley IPOs in the past couple of years, Lending Club 2019s might have been the surest bet of all. The San Francisco peer-to-peer lender is a star in the world of 201cfintech, 201d a growing sector made up of financial technology companies bent on disrupting the traditional banking sector. Its backers include venture capital royalty such as Kleiner Perkins and Union Square Ventures, not to mention Google GOOG and Alibaba BABA . The startup 2019s gold-plated board of directors includes luminaries such as John Mack, the former CEO of Morgan Stanley MS ; former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers; and Mary Meeker, the one-time doyenne of Internet IPOs who is now a Kleiner partner. In other words, Lending Club LC had assembled a very smart-money crowd. Its much-buzzed-about offering was viewed, understandably, as a slam dunk. In December 2014, led by underwriters at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs GS , Lending Club priced its shares at $15, above the high end of the proposed range of $12 to $14. The IPO was 20 times oversubscribed and instantly gave the company a market value of nearly $6 billion. On the first day of trading, Lending Club 2019s stock jumped almost 70% before pulling back to close at $23.42 a share, a one-day pop of 56%. For shareholders who got out quickly, it went in the books as another very successful offering. Then reality set in. Lending Club 2019s stock peaked about a week after its IPO, at nearly $26 a share, and has been retreating ever since. Never mind that the startup delivered extraordinary financial results in its first year as a public company: Lending Club 2019s operating revenue was up more than 100% in the first nine months of 2015 compared with the same period in 2014, and its Ebitda, a measure of earnings before subtracting expenses such as interest and taxes, was up more than 200%. The stock recently traded around $8 a share, nearly 50% below its $15 IPO price.

It now trades well below the IPO price.Photo: Richard Drew 2014AP Naturally, Lending Club CEO and co-founder Renaud Laplanche wishes the stock price were higher. But he 2019s trying to look past short-term vicissitudes. 201cPart of the main reason for going public was to continue to establish Lending Club 2019s brand and credibility, 201d he says. 201cWe 2019re building a big company. It 2019s going to take a very long time, but we want to do it in the public eye with full transparency. I think from that standpoint, we got rewarded. I think the Lending Club brand is a lot more established now than it was a year ago. 201d That may be true with customers and bankers, but ask any retail investor who made a bet on Lending Club at around $20 a share about the company 2019s brand today, and the response is likely to be a grimace followed by a torrent of vitriol. Unfortunately the Lending Club story is not an isolated case. Time and time again during the current IPO cycle, Wall Street underwriters 2014egged on by ambitious CEOs, hungry venture capitalists, and favored institutional investors 2014have hyped one technology IPO after another. The bankers price the offerings for perfection, watch them soar on the first day of trading to deliver the coveted first-day spike, and don 2019t stick around to offer an explanation after the shares plunge below the first-day price. (Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs declined to comment for this story.) Welcome to the world of zombie tech stocks 2014once-highflying IPOs wandering aimlessly in the wasteland of the public equity markets and understandably unloved by investors. Many have familiar names, such as Zynga (down about 75% from its IPO price) znga , Twitter (down 30%) twtr , and Groupon (down 85%) grpn . Online craft marketplace Etsy etsy recently traded 56% below last year 2019s price at IPO and 77% under its first-day close. Others that are less well-known 2014like Nimble Storage (67% below IPO price) nmbl 2014have been just as disappointing. To be fair, some major tech IPOs have soared in recent years, among them LinkedIn lnkd , Tesla Motors tsla , and, after a rocky and controversial start, Facebook fb . But these are the exceptions. The detritus far outnumber the success stories, raising the question, Is the method by which companies go public as broken and inequitable as it ever was? That would certainly seem to be the case. And the problem is especially acute when it comes to tech companies for which relentless forward momentum is key not only to pleasing investors but also to attracting talent and keeping their competitive edge. This set of facts doesn 2019t bode well for the current wave of talked-up technology companies in the IPO pipeline 2014the so-called unicorns, or private startups valued at $1 billion or more by their investors. This once-rare species of startup has proliferated lately in Silicon Valley and beyond 2014from headliners such as Uber and Airbnb to lower-profile newcomers like Apttus and HelloFresh. Last year Fortune identified more than 80 unicorns for a cover story on the phenomenon; by our most recent count, that number has grown to 173. (Click here to see the new Unicorn List.) According to CB Insights, a research firm that tracks venture capital investments, private investors have plowed some $362 billion into startups in just the past five years. That means that a tremendous backlog of potential technology IPOs is building up just as the stock market is beginning to look very wobbly after its nearly seven-year bull run. Indeed, U.S. stock indexes began 2016 with their worst first-two-week period in history. The S&P 500 fell 8% in the first 10 trading days, and the S&P tech sector underperformed the broader market by a full percentage point. For an already weakening tech IPO market, the turbulence in stocks is a punch to the stomach. In mid-January, IPO research specialists Renaissance Capital put out a special report called 201cExploring the Disappearing Technology IPO. 201d The trends it identified were not encouraging. From 2012 through 2014, according to Renaissance, there were an average of 36 venture-backed tech IPOs per year. But in 2015 that number dropped to 23, and only seven of those offerings happened in the second half of the year, partly because of a stock market correction in August. Though the average time from founding to IPO reached a high for tech deals in 2015, the profitability of the typical technology company going public has plunged into negative territory over the past couple of years. The median Ebitda for tech companies going public in 2015 was 2013$9 million. All signs point to a continued slowdown in tech IPO activity in 2016, says Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance and the company 2019s manager of IPO-focused ETFs. She says it won 2019t take long for the unicorns to feel the chill as well. 201cWhat 2019s happening now is just going to take the bottom out of these private valuations, many of which are imaginary, 201d says Smith. 201cAnd this valuation reset is going to have a very negative effect on new funding. 201d It appears that a reckoning is coming in the tech world. The combined value ascribed to the 173 unicorns by their investors is a stunning $585 billion 2014an especially astonishing figure given that so many of them aren 2019t even close to profitable. Sky-high valuations 2014driven in part by unicorn mania and an influx of money from nontraditional (and less disciplined) venture investors 2014have limited the number of potential acquirers for a lot of the buzziest companies. (For more, read 201cThree Unicorns to Bet On. 201d) A number of startups may have hoarded enough capital to ride out the rough patch, but even those that survive could experience mass defections and morale-killing 201cdown rounds. 201d In mid-January, for example, check-in app company Foursquare raised $45 million in new venture funding but was forced to accept a valuation of less than half the $650 million value it was given by its investors a few years ago. 201cI imagine there 2019s going to be some pivots in some business models, 201d says John Gabbert, founder and CEO of VC data provider PitchBook. There is also certain to be increased pressure from the VC community for any tech company on the verge of readiness to seek the 201cexit 201d of the IPO process even as it is shrinking. But every IPO currently trading below its IPO price creates a negative feedback loop, making the odds of the average unicorn getting out a little longer every day. And it doesn 2019t help that the process is fundamentally rigged against them. To appreciate the extent of the tech IPO problem, it helps to understand a bit about the IPO process itself. The system has long been designed to benefit the Wall Street underwriters and their favored clients 2014venture capital and buyout firms, as well as the big institutional buyers of IPOs 2014at the expense of individual and retail investors, who have been brainwashed into thinking they are getting their hands on the Next Big Thing. The venture capitalists or private equity investors 2014who finance the company while it is private 2014also have a big say in the IPO process. They want to make money on their investment, of course, and generally the most they possibly can. They push the underwriters relentlessly to get the highest price possible for the IPO, securing for them the biggest profit. But near the end of the process they begin to remember that they 2019re not selling all their shares in the IPO. At that point they actually prefer a dynamic in which the stock is actively hyped 2014to generate enthusiastic demand for it 2014but the 201cfloat, 201d or the percentage of the company 2019s shares sold in the IPO, is kept small (say, around 15%) to curtail supply. High demand for something in short supply leads to one outcome: a higher and higher price for the stock when it finally hits the market. That way the VCs can double dip: They can crow a bit and notch a big gain on their initial investment (perhaps even selling some shares in the offering), but can also know that they were clever in hanging on to most of their stock, especially when the stock moves up smartly on the first day of trading. The big Wall Street underwriters set the rules of the game. 201cMorgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs will tell you it 2019s not a successful IPO unless there 2019s a 20% to 30% pop, 201d says John Buttrick, a partner at Union Square Ventures. 201cThat 2019s the way they get graded with their clients: Did the stock trade up after pricing? Much of the IPO machine is focused on generating a sugar-rush spike in the trading price during the two to four weeks after IPO. After that, the market takes over: 2018Sorry, not my problem. 2019 They profess to take a long-term view, but the data shows post-IPO stocks are very volatile in the case of tech IPOs, and that is not a problem the underwriters try to address. 201d Another important constituency for IPOs is the big institutional buyers of them 2014mutual fund firms such as Fidelity, T. Rowe Price, and the Capital Group. They like the first-day pop too, because that means they make money instantly. Twenty-five years ago Peter Lynch, when he was running Fidelity 2019s Magellan Fund, used to refer to IPOs as 201csunset stocks 201d 2014as in, 201cthe sun never sets on an IPO in my portfolio. 201d Interestingly, it 2019s a system that has also defied innovation. In the past decade or so, some clever new ways have been created for companies to raise the equity capital they need without going the IPO route. There are now a number of secondary markets where equity capital can be raised privately and where insiders can sell their stock to new investors in order to get some liquidity in ways that were never before available. The JOBS Act, which took effect in 2013, allowed smaller companies to file prospectuses privately and raise capital much more discreetly than in the past, as a way to get some of the benefits of a public offering without the many negatives of excessive scrutiny and regulation. These changes have in fact helped enable the rise of the unicorns. And yet Wall Street hardly appears to have lost its leverage in the IPO process. If anything, the opposite is true. The aftermath of the financial crisis 2014a world in which there are fewer and fewer underwriters, and many of the European banks have all but disappeared from the underwriting market 2014has reinforced the power of the established IPO underwriters to keep the status quo working for them and their best customers. That means that despite the hype that still surrounds them, the growing universe of unicorns out there has little choice but to submit to the IPO cartel if it wants to raise a significant amount of equity capital. For every Uber, which seemingly attracts as much capital as it wants in the private market at increasingly stratospheric valuations, there are a hundred companies that must submit to the powers that be when it comes to raising new money. As an example of how regular investors get the short end of this process, consider the cautionary tale of GoPro gpro , the company behind every adventure athlete 2019s favorite digital camera 2014perfect for attaching to your head so that you can record your wild-ass snowboarding and base-jumping exploits. Remember how cool Nick Woodman, GoPro 2019s founder and CEO, seemed in all those interviews that cropped up before and after his company 2019s IPO? When GoPro went public, in June 2014, at $24 a share, the company raised $491 million, and the lead underwriters at J.P. Morgan Chase, Citigroup, and Barclays pocketed more than $28 million in fees. Right on cue, GoPro 2019s stock sprinted up nearly 50%, delivering that all-important pop. Within three months, on Sept. 30,2014, it was near $95 a share, giving the company a market value of more than $13 billion. These days Woodman isn 2019t talking so much. (He declined a request to be interviewed for this story.) For months GoPro 2019s share price has been plummeting faster than a mountain biker on a headlong descent. In mid-January, trading in GoPro 2019s stock had to be temporarily halted after the company warned of disappointing fourth-quarter results and said it planned to lay off 7% of its workforce. Lawyers representing shareholders quickly slapped the company with class-action lawsuits. GoPro 2019s shares recently traded for less than $12, more than 50% below its IPO price. It 2019s been a painful reversal. But many of GoPro 2019s institutional investors from the IPO probably still have fond memories of the stock. That 2019s because they got to buy it at $24 and watch it soar to $36 2014then unload it for a quick 50% gain. What 2019s not to like? And if both the venture capitalists and the institutional investors are happy with the first-day pop, then the underwriters are happy too, because their biggest repeat customers are both the private investors and the big institutional investors. To be sure, their high fees 2014the underwriting charge in the GoPro IPO was 6% 2014are nice too. But the real goal is making sure that their customers are happy and do business with them again and again. At Goldman Sachs, one of the firm 2019s mantras is to be 201clong-term greedy, 201d and the IPO underwriting process is a perfect example of how it puts that philosophy into practice. It 2019s one of the few businesses in the world today that has remained virtually impervious to disruption by Silicon Valley. William Hambrecht has been talking about changing the way IPOs are underwritten and priced for close to 20 years, since he left his firm Hambrecht & Quist (which was then sold to what is now J.P. Morgan Chase) and started W.R. Hambrecht & Co. in 1998 with the hope of upending the way the Wall Street cartel manages and markets IPOs. One of the firm 2019s high-water marks came early in its existence when it was one of the underwriters of the Google IPO, in August 2004. (There were 31 underwriters in all, led by Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse First Boston.) Eleven years on, people may no longer remember how controversial it was at the time for Google to have adopted Hambrecht & Co. 2019s auction strategy for what became the most important company in a generation. After conducting an online Dutch auction for the Google shares, in which investors named the price they would pay and orders were filled in the order of those who bid the highest price, the underwriters priced the Google IPO at $85 a share, below expectations. The stock closed on the first day at about $100 a share, up 17%. (In the end the lead underwriters didn 2019t strictly adhere to the auction strategy in its purest form.) Experimenting with a different IPO pricing model certainly didn 2019t hurt Google. The tech giant 2019s stock is up some 1,500% from its IPO, and the company (renamed Alphabet last year) has a market value approaching $500 billion, second only to Apple 2019s AAPL . Its stock chart looks like one side of the Matterhorn. But very few other companies have been willing to go public the way Google did, through an auction process. (Some have, including Morningstar morn , up more than 400% from its IPO, and Interactive Broker Group ibkr , up about 50%.) Rather than a turning point, the Google IPO is remembered more as a historical footnote. Hambrecht thinks the way IPOs are manufactured and sold remains a problem. 201cIt really is a system that is broken, 201d he says. He thinks the 201ctraditional approach 201d needs to change but knows that the big underwriters won 2019t do it, despite their understanding, intellectually, that the auction approach is a fairer system. They just make too much money as things currently stand. 201cThe underwriters stick to the traditional approach because, first of all, it allows them to discount the pricing, 201d he continues. 201cIt gives them selective allocation to their best customers. And they 2019ve tried to keep a knowledge advantage, so it 2019s really a proprietary product through the first six months or a year of the trading. All of those things enhance the profitability to the underwriter. 201d He says that when, say, Alibaba pops from $68 a share to $115 a share, as it did in the first few months after its IPO, the underwriters cash in because their institutional clients have made a lot of money and pay them back in kind over time. 201cThe people who buy it in the aftermarket are the shareholders who end up, in effect, holding the bag, 201d he says. Hambrecht doubts that the system will ever change unless a reform is forced on the banks legislatively (as was briefly considered after the Facebook IPO) or their vicelike grip on the large IPO business is disrupted. 201cIt 2019s deeply entrenched, 201d he says. In fact, Hambrecht is so resigned to the inevitable power of the name-brand underwriters that he 2019s decided he won 2019t try to fight them anymore. Instead, he 2019s returned to what he did once upon a time at Hambrecht & Quist: Taking smaller startups public. His latest eponymous firm, Hambrecht & Co., specializes in underwriting for companies that have valuations below the unicorn threshold and garner less interest from the big banks. Despite the deck being stacked against them during the underwriting process, some executives at newly public companies say they wouldn 2019t change a thing. In this camp are James Park, the co-founder and CEO of Fitbit fit , and William Zerella, its chief financial officer. Last June, Fitbit, a maker of fitness tracking devices, priced its IPO at $20 a share, above its indicated range. Morgan Stanley was the lead underwriter. The stock opened up 52% right away and ended up about that much, giving the company a market value of $6.5 billion and making Park nearly a demi-billionaire. In November the company completed a secondary offering, at $29 a share 2014below the $31.68 a share where it had closed the day before 2014in which 14 million of the 17 million shares sold came from its VC financiers. It was, in part, a move to reduce the downward pressure on the stock as the expiration of the six-month lockup period loomed. These days, after a poorly received new-product offering, Fitbit trades below its IPO price. Fitbit CEO James Park outside the NYSE on the day of his company 2019s IPO in June 2015. 201cThe pop on the first day really gave the company a lot of great momentum in the press and with employees. 201dPhoto: Richard Drew 2014AP But despite the stock 2019s roller-coaster ride, Park and Zerella say they couldn 2019t be happier with how the IPO was handled. Zerella credits his bankers for the way they ran the process. 201cThey understood our story and were very helpful in articulating it to the Street, 201d he says, although it also helped that Fitbit is a leader in its space and very profitable. Park says that he and his management team were excited by the IPO and by being on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange when the stock first traded. He has no regrets about not pricing the IPO higher to get more of the offering proceeds for the company. Park says he understands the players at the table have to get their cut. 201cI think the worst outcome would have been for it to trade below the offering price [in the days after the IPO], 201d he says. 201cIt was a delicate dance, and I feel that we struck the right balance in the price of the deal. And the pop on the first day really gave the company a lot of great momentum in the press and with employees. 201d Other perks: Park says the Fitbit IPO let the world know just how profitable his company is 2014with Ebitda margins of around 23% 2014and how, despite some formidable competition from Apple and others, Fitbit remains the industry leader. He points out that Fitbit now has a currency to use for potential acquisitions and says that going public has given the company 2019s employees something to root for together 2014its stock price. 201cIt 2019s been a great event, 201d he says. 201cIt really cements us as a world-class company. 201d Laplanche of Lending Club, for his part, tries to put his company 2019s IPO experience in the most charitable light. But he can 2019t help scratching his head about how the stock has traded since those hype-filled early weeks after the IPO. He says that if the stock hadn 2019t jumped past $25 a share and had just traded at around $15, there would have been less disappointment, especially for the retail investors. 201cThat being said, if they made a long-term investment, then I 2019m very confident that we 2019re going to continue to deliver great results, 201d he says. No thanks to the standard IPO process. One of the reasons behind the volatility of Lending Club 2019s share price is the simple matter of supply and demand. The underwriters at Goldman and Morgan Stanley argued for a float of between 10% and 15% of the shares outstanding, and in the end it was around 15%. That created scarcity value initially, leading to the coveted opening-day pop. That 2019s the good news. The bad news came at the end of the six-month lockup period, when the Lending Club 2019s VC investors started selling their shares into the market. Whether it 2019s a coincidence or not, Lending Club 2019s share price moved from about $19 in early June 2015 to a low of around $11 three months later 2014in effect tracking the increase in supply of stock during the year as the venture capitalists started unloading their stakes in the company. Laplanche, of course, understands these supply-demand dynamics. But he 2019s not sure less sophisticated investors appreciate the subtleties of lockup periods and floats. 201cIt can be a bit frustrating, particularly for people who wonder, Okay, what 2019s wrong with the company? Is there something there that drives the stock price? 201d he says. 201cI think we 2019re a good case study for it because we continue to report good news after good news, so there 2019s really no fundamental you can point to to explain the stock performance. Really, all that 2019s left is supply and demand of shares. 201d All indicators point to Lending Club being more than strong enough financially to soar past its post-IPO doldrums. In an increasingly tough environment for tech companies, some of its peers may not be.

   "input": "We told the story about one man 2019s extreme experience of time warping; when he entered the shower, water droplets seemed to freeze in the air 2013 an experience that he compared to bullet time in the The Matrix films. Since some researchers suspect the strange feeling of a time warp may be surprisingly common, we asked our readers to send us their own experiences of time slowing down. We were amazed by the response. Phill Healey, for instance, described a terrifying car crash: I turned a corner to see a tow truck stopped suddenly in front of me. I put on the brakes just in time , only for my passengers to tell me we were about to be hit by a bus from behind. I recall looking at them listening to their explanation and then looking behind me to see the bus hit the car and knock us into the tow truck. The event seemed to happen very slowly yet our actions occurred at normal speed. How I was able to talk to my passengers and see the bus hit us and then turn around and see the tow truck in front of us come closer, I do not know. I've always described it as time appearing to go slowly. Ijuaigi Emmanuel , felt something similar while sitting with some friends under a live electric cable. Hearing a spark above them, he looked up, to see it falling in slow motion, before they ran to safety. Some researchers suggest that when we are confronted with danger, the rush of stress hormones could accelerate our thought processing, which makes the outside world seem to move slowly in comparison. The idea would certainly tally with Andrew Arthur Prescott 2019s lightning-quick reactions that saved his son. As he put it: I do not have good reactions and am somewhat uncoordinated , poor at sports. When my son was small we put him on a high playground slide, when he was still too top heavy. He seemed to fall to one side and over the edge, and I seemed to have all the time in the world to move to catch him. Occasionally , the feeling of super-human power can end in bathos, as Wendy Crossley describes: My foot gave way , which it is apt to do from time to time. I felt I was flying like superman, arm out stretched. It seemed like a lifetime that I was floating in air slow motion. I eventually collapsed in an unladylike manner onto the pavement in a heap with a twisted ankle and hurt pride. For most people , a time warp is a one-off experience, but David Bull says he has seen the world in slow motion on numerous occasions. Like Healey, he saw a car crash in excruciating detail, and saw everyone on the stairs in the London Underground moving abnormally slowly. He also describes a more prolonged experience, after surfing, where he found it strangely difficult to judge the speed of his car. 201cI would drive at 100 kph which for the first 30 minutes of driving felt like about maybe 5-10 kph. 201d If you have never seen the world stand still, Olumide Olaoye points out an illusion that is a little more mundane, but that everyone can do: Sometimes it seems to my eyes that the 'second hand' of the clock stops for a second or less. Or at other times it seems to move backwards before it picks up again. This is known as the 201cstopped-clock illusion 201d and is thought to be caused by tiny eye movements , known as saccades, that temporarily slow our perception, leading it to look like the hand of the clock is jammed before it picks up again. As the patient in our original article pointed out, it doesn 2019t take much for us all to get the feeling that we are living in an altered reality.

   "input": "Retirement planners like to relay best practices to clients via simple, easy-to-understand rules. Whether it 2019s sticking to a 4% yearly withdrawal rate or having your bond exposure match your age, these rules-of-thumb have translated into investing strategies for years now. Of course, these tips come with plenty of research to back them up 2013 a 4% withdrawal rate has a strong chance of lasting a lifetime, for example. But sometimes these rules get turned upside down. One rule undergoing such an evolution has to do with stock exposure during retirement. For a long time, conventional wisdom has held that your stock exposure should steadily decline as you age. But a growing number of experts think that today 2019s retirees need to keep much more of their portfolio in the stock market than they might expect. In the past, when the typical retirement lasted 10 to 15 years, there wasn 2019t a huge need for stocks in the portfolio. But, the 201cretirement time horizon has gone up, 201d says Stuart Ritter, vice president at T. Rowe Price Investment Services and a financial planner at the firm. With people living longer, the need to take on the risk of stocks (in return for the potentially greater reward) has increased. Though inflation has been low lately, its threat to the value of your retirement savings grows with greater longevity: While a dollar 2019s value may not decrease much in a decade, it will decrease a lot over 35 years. These trends have led a growing number of financial planners to advocate a rising equity 201cglide path. 201d While this idea isn 2019t as easy as others to sum up with a platitude, the basic idea is that your exposure to stocks should increase, rather than decrease, as you age in retirement. Working with the American Institute for Economic Research, Luke Delorme conducted a study to determine the ideal asset-allocation strategy for retirees, assuming a 4% withdrawal rate. The best strategy, he found, was to begin with a 20% allocation of stocks as you enter retirement at age 65, and then increase that allocation gradually every year, over 30 years, until you have a 70% equity exposure at age 95. 201cThe time that people need to be most conservative is not in retirement, 201d says Delorme. 201cbut at the beginning of retirement. 201d Here 2019s why: Your portfolio is most vulnerable to risk right after you retire. If the market takes a tumble during the first few years of your extended vacation, then it 2019s difficult to rebuild your portfolio without going back to work. So keeping stock exposure low at that point protects you from the potential of losing out in the beginning of retirement. But since stocks have historically risen an average of 7% a year over the long-term, gradually increasing your exposure over time increases your odds that your portfolio will last into your later years. If you have a pension, you can take a bit more risk, says Delorme, who now works as director of financial planning at American Investment Services. You can have a higher allocation of stocks when you leave the workforce, and you can increase stock exposure to 80% within retirement. T. Rowe Price 2019s Ritter explains the glide path concept differently. He places client assets into two buckets 2013 one for the first 15 years of retirement, the other for the second 15. In the 201cfirst 15 201d bucket, assets be concentrated in on safe, short-term investment vehicles like bonds and fixed income. The second 15 years 2019 worth of savings goes into stocks. Placing clients 2019 money in the two buckets, Ritter says, 201chelps put the short term volatility 201d of the market into the context of a broader strategy; investors who know their short-term needs are taken care of are less likely to get scared and pull money out of the market. While they may not use the term 201crising equity glide path, 201d more financial planners are latching on to the idea of increasing stock exposure in retirement. You often hear of a 50-50 stock to bond ratio for retirees these days. And if you have a higher withdrawal rate, chances are you will also need to take on more risk (unless your nest egg is truly massive). 201cThe biggest driver is less around the allocation of risk, 201d says JPMorgan Private Bank 2019s David Lyon. Instead, it 2019s based on 201chow much you 2019re spending on your balance sheet. 201d In other words, if you have expensive tastes, then you may want to get used to living with more risk. That 2019s not a clich 00e9; it 2019s life.  ",

   "input": "Hedge funder Christopher Hansen 2019s Valiant Capital Management has gotten a big boost from its lineage. Hansen is an alumnus of a hedge fund of someone who once worked for Tiger Fund Management 2019s Julian Robertson 2014earning Valiant the nickname inside the industry, like a number of other firms, of Tiger Cub, though Valiant is technically a grandcub. But it 2019s another animal, itself legendary, that could be his undoing 2014the unicorn. About one-quarter of the fund is invested in private companies, including seven so-called tech unicorns 2014companies valued at over $1 billion. The unicorns had helped propel the San Francisco-based Valiant 2019s returns in recent years, but this year have landed the fund in the red, as a number of blow-ups have caused investors to grow more cautious about the richly valued start-ups. Valiant told investors last month that its main fund is down slightly under 10% through April, according to an individual familiar with the performance. Write-downs on its big portfolio of private investments appear to be a major factor, according to investor documents Fortune has obtained. But a thorough analysts of Valiant 2019s documents seems to show that Hansen 2019s fund may actually be down more than he is letting on. According to the documents, Valiant appears to have failed to fully write down the value of a number of his unicorn holdings. As a result, the fund is valuing those holdings at inflated prices, at least compared with where other similar fund say those investments are now worth. That likely means Valiant performance, even its poor performance, is inflated this year as well. The Securities and Exchange Commission is concerned with how funds are marking their holdings of the highly valued tech start-ups and whether they may be deceiving their investors. Last last year, the SEC began investigating mutual funds to audit their procedures for valuing the private holdings. In a March speech at Stanford Law School, SEC Chairwoman Mary Jo White said that the SEC was committed to protecting investors in the so-called unicorns no matter how sophisticated or high net worth they are. Hedge funds typically cater to high net worth individuals. 201cNearly all venture valuations are highly subjective, 201d White said during the March speech. 201cThe concern is whether the prestige associated with reaching a sky high valuation fast drives companies to try to appear more valuable than they actually are. 201d Hansen,47, launched Valiant in 2008 after leaving $5 billion Blue Ridge Capital, one of the storied Tiger cub hedge funds run by the notoriously reclusive John Griffin. The Blue Ridge scion began investing in venture capital in 2009 and scored some big hits with Facebook and Alibaba, which he quickly sold out of with 31% gains in each. Valiant ramped up its venture investing and now has 23 investments, including big names like Dropbox, Evernote, Pinterest, and Uber, according to its investor documents. The investments are held in a separate side pocket, and investor capital is locked in until Valiant exits the privates, via IPOs or other sales. Valiant doesn 2019t take performance fees on the privates until that time either. A big drop in the value of the private tech companies would hurt Valiant more than other hedge funds as it is believed to have more in privates than most of its peers. At leading tech-oriented Tiger Global, for example, privates account for less than 8% of the firm 2019s $8 billion hedge fund, as it invests in startups in separate private equity funds. Tiger Global was down 21% through March, but only about 10% of the losses are attributable to write downs of its private investments, according to an individual familiar with the fund 2019s results. Even by its own numbers, Valiant is having a bad year. The stock market is basically flat for the year. But if Valiant was marking it holdings where other funds are, its performance would be even worse. Take Dropbox one of the most troubled of Valiant 2019s big VC holdings. Last year, mutual funds Fidelity and T. Rowe Price began writing down their holdings of Dropbox, which has been struggling to justify its $10 billion valuation. As of the end of 2015, Valiant said it valued its Dropbox stake at $50.4 million, or $18 per share, according to calculations from investor documents. Others weren 2019t so charitable. By end of last year, Fidelity had written down Dropbox to $13.50 per share and T. Rowe Price had slashed it to $9.40, nearly down to where Valiant 2019s purchased the shares at $9.05. If Valiant had valued its Dropbox stake where T. Rowe Price did, the fund would have had an additional $24 million in losses on that stock alone. 201cDropbox has greatly exceeded all of Valiant 2019s expectations and guidance to date, 201d Hansen wrote in an investor presentation at the time, though he added that the company has 201cslightly underperformed on the enterprise side. 201d Evernote, a cloud-based note taking and storage app that Valiant said was worth $1.4 billion at year-end, is in even worse shape than Dropbox. Last year, Business Insider wrote a story about the company 2019s 201cdeep troubles. 201d Valiant invested in several financing rounds of Evernote, and at the end of December it valued Evernote at $12.56 per share, which was a little above break-even for the hedge fund, documents show. Even so, it may have been too optimistic: T.Rowe Price marked Evernote down to $7.66 at year-end. While others in the industry are questioning Evernote 2019s future, Valiant claims that 201cthe company is cementing its leadership position in the space 201d with 1 million new users each month. Valiant declined to comment for this article. It could very well be that the fund has adjusted the value of those holdings and others this year. But according to a source, Valiant had only cut the value of its overall private portfolio by 10%. But you would have expected that group on investments to have tumbled more. T. Rowe, for instance, further cut its price of Dropbox to $7.91 at the end of March, according to the Wall Street Journal. By that measure, Valiant 2019s investment in the storage company has plunged 56% from where it marked it at the end of last year. Its Evernote stake, appears to have tumbled as well. T. Rowe now values that company at $6.04, a 52% below where Valiant had valued the stake at the end of 2015. Valiant uses third-party valuation agent Duff & Phelps to help determine the marks, which it makes quarterly. Since Valiant is not collecting performance fees on the private states until the companies are sold or go public, Valiant may argue that it doesn 2019t matter where it values the stakes now as long as it gets them right at the IPO or sale. But that 2019s not correct. Since the value works into the overall performance of the funds, inflated values can cause the fund to look like it is doing better than it is, giving Hansen the ability to raise more funds, which it has recently started doing. The hedge fund, which told investors it wants to keep assets near $2.5 billion, opened the door this year to new money, hoping to offset redemptions, according to a February Reuters report. On top of that, while Valiant isn 2019t collecting performance fee on the private investments, it is collecting its 2% management fee on the value of all the assets in his fund. Inflated valuations of those unicorns will boost what Valiant collects from its management fee. Valiant still has big gains in Uber and Pinterest, valued at $64 billion and $11 billion respectively. Although Pinterest has been mentioned as a 2016 IPO candidate, Valiant seems to have slightly cooled on the social media company, writing it down 3% during the fourth quarter to $6.97 per share. Funds run by two investment companies Hartford and The Principal have dropped the value of their Pintrest stakes to $6.43 per share. Overall, Valiant had an annualized gain of 9% since inception through 2015. But if the unicorns keep spearing this tiger, that number is going to get smaller.  ",

   "input": "Overcoming years of poor health and crisis, the euro zone economy grew at its fastest pace in five years in the first quarter, driven by unlikely stars such as France and Spain. It now stands larger than it did at its peak before the financial crisis, albeit having taken eight years to recover. The bloc also slipped back into deflation in April. Blowing past both the U.S. and British economies, the latter weighed down by uncertainty over possibly leaving the Europe Union, euro zone growth doubled from the previous quarter, beating even the most optimistic expectations on healthy household consumption and a rebound in investments. But the surge, a welcome relief less than a year after Greece was nearly ejected from the bloc, may be just a blip; Europe is still weighed down by high debt, weak bank profits, high unemployment and vast excess capacity in the economy. Nonetheless, growth among the 19 countries sharing the euro jumped 0.6 percent on the quarter, well past expectations for 0.4 percent and ahead of Britain 2019s 0.4 percent. The U.S. economy grew 0.5 percent on an annualized basis in the first quarter, implying only slightly more than 0.12 percent for the three months. Annual euro zone growth held steady at 1.6 percent, more than three times the U.S. rate in the same period. The numbers defied expectations for a slowdown and were as improved sentiment, plunging energy costs and a slow but steady fall in unemployment and buoyed spending. 201cThe first months of the year were tumultuous with large stock market declines, growth concerns in the US, China and many emerging markets and plummeting confidence among businesses and consumers, 201d ING economist Bert Colijn said in a note. 201cClearly, businesses and consumers have not acted on their gut feelings, 201d Colijn said. 201cDomestic strength in the Eurozone economy is key to current economic growth. This is mostly because of improvements in the job market. 201d Indeed, unemployment in the euro zone, though still high, fell to 10.2 percent in March from 10.4 percent a month earlier, its lowest in over four years, with Spain among the most improved. The news was not all positive, however, as fresh inflation data showed the bloc was back in deflation in April, giving the European Central Bank its single biggest headache as it struggles to boost prices. Consumer prices fell by 0.2 percent compared to a year earlier, moving down from an unchanged reading March, even after the ECB unveiled fresh stimulus in December and March in hopes of boosting inflation, which has undershot its 2 percent target for more than three years already. In a perhaps more worrying sign for policymakers, core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, also slowed, raising fears that low energy prices are feeding into the price of other goods and services. The ECB is especially worried about this so-called second round effect of low crude prices because once they feed into wages, breaking the cycle of low inflation becomes especially difficult. Still, ECB chief economist Peter Praet defended the bank 2019s measures on Friday, arguing that only a significant worsening of the inflation outlook would warrant more stimulus. 201cDeploying negative rates again in the future would require a distinct worsening of the inflation outlook, 201d Praet told Spanish newspaper Expansi 00f3n. 201cI don 2019t think we 2019re going to see these conditions materializing in the near future. 201d 201cWe shouldn 2019t be talking of new instruments, 201d Praet added. Heading into the second quarter, the euro zone appears to remain on solid footing. Indeed, sentiment improved more than expected in April, driven by across the board optimism among industry, services, construction sector and households. Preliminary purchasing managers 2019 data and Germany 2019s Ifo business climate index also pointed to continued expansion as did fresh lending data showing the most robust expansion since 2011. Growth could also get a fresh boost from the ECB 2019s corporate bond buys and new round of ultra cheap loans. Still, the first quarter could ultimately turn out to be a peak for growth, with most projections indicating flatlining growth over the next several years as Europe remains weighed down by the legacy of its crisis.

Original Coors 2019s volume is less than one-third the level of the mid-1980s. Budweiser, which accounts for more than half Anheuser-Busch 2019s $8.7-billion-a-year in beer sales, saw its volume sink 9% from 1990 through last year, while Miller 2019s heavyweight brand, Lite, was off 16%. With big-brand images in trouble (see box), beer bosses are cutting prices to lure consumers even as they scramble desperately to develop or buy the types of beer that American drinkers will pay more for 2014 imports, whose sales rose 11% last year, and microbrews, whose tiny 1% market share is nonetheless expanding at an eye-popping 50% annual clip. The result of all this ferment, says Michael Bellas, president of Beverage Marketing in New York City, is that 201cthe U.S. beer industry is going through a sea change I haven 2019t seen in 20 years. 201d And when change of that magnitude roils a market, heads usually roll as well. At No. 2 Miller, owned by Philip Morris, and at Coors, at least 70% of the top 15 or so management positions have changed occupants in the past year alone. More than half the newcomers are from outside the beer business. For new and old alike, the central question posed by beer 2019s new brand game is this: How does a multibillion-dollar company create products to compete against little guys 2014 and simultaneously protect its big established brands? The answers are relevant to marketers in any industry. Obvious Step One: Innovate. True, no one sees anything revolutionary on the horizon. Says Anheuser-Busch CEO August Busch III, 57: 201cI don 2019t think there 2019s going to be a completely new way to make beer or a breakthrough as there was in the Seventies with light beer. 201d But this year the industry has introduced about 40 2014 count 2019em 2014 new 201cice 201d beers. Pure gimmickry? You bet. Ice beers, first developed in Canada, are beers produced at temperatures just a few degrees colder than ordinary brew, which gives them a slightly above-average alcohol content. Still, 201cice 201d has turned out to be one cool marketing ploy. The products have captured almost 6% of industry sales 2014 more than all imports combined. Among the major players, the most dynamic 2014 and desperate 2014 transformation is taking place in the malt-scented valley of Golden, Colorado. Here Coors last year imported the first nonfamily member in its 121-year history to run its beer business. As head of a vulnerable No. 3 in a flat market where more than 700 companies have gone out of business in the past 50 years, CEO Peter Coors,47, admits that he 2019s pursuing a survival strategy. Of his decision to seek outside help, he explains simply, 201cI wasn 2019t smart enough to know what to do. I needed professional management. 201d Miller CEO Jack MacDonough holds a hot product, his new Icehouse beer. YOU 2019D SURE never mistake new president W. Leo Kiely III for a Coors family member. Unlike that skinny, conservative, low-key crowd, Kiely,47, is a rambunctious independent with a beer-barrel body. Despite appearances, though, he 2019s no lifetime brew man. Kiely spent the previous 11 years at PepsiCo 2019s Frito-Lay unit, where he rose to president of the central U.S. division and was a candidate to head the entire Frito-Lay company. Hired with a mandate to shake Coors up, Kiely has replaced seven of the top nine managers (one position, chief financial officer, is yet to be filled). His goal: to pump up Coors 2019s unpredictable but consistently lousy return on investment (4% last year) to at least 10% in three years. To do that, says Kiely, 201cwe need to be innovative in everything we do. 201d Coors, already an impressive technical innovator (it introduced the first aluminum can and the first cold-filtered beer, both in 1959), especially needs to become a more creative marketer. Kiely has scored a minor hit by launching the Colorado Silver Bullets, the first all-female professional baseball team since the 1950s, to promote Coors Light. The team 2019s record is terrible (5-37 against all-male, minor-league, and semipro opponents). But unexpectedly large crowds are turning out to root for the underdogs. Hitting a home run looks much less likely. A possible model: George Killian 2019s Irish Red, a thoroughly American beer that gets no TV advertising but by dint of its clever name (Coors licensed it from a long-defunct brewer in Enniscorthy, Ireland, in the early 1980s) is stocked in retailers 2019 import cases and commands a high price. Killian 2019s is now neck and neck with Samuel Adams as the largest specialty beer in the U.S. Coors 2019s bigger bet is Zima, a clear drink whose zigzag performance shows just how risky product development can be. 201cZima is a sexy new product, 201d insists Kiely, who accelerated its rollout this year. Cleverly advertised as a mystery drink with 201czecret ingredienz, 201d fizzy, foam-free Zima is tremendously successful in new markets, where 70% of alcoholic-beverage consumers 2014 including women who don 2019t drink beer 2014 typically try it. But sales quickly sink because, sigh, people don 2019t like the stuff very much. Some choice samples from an informal FORTUNE survey conducted over the Internet: 201cZima zucks, 201d and it tastes like 201ctonic water, antifreeze, and crushed SweetTart candies mixed with skunked (translation: spoiled) Molson. 201d Zima may give Coors a brief but pleasurable buzz. Wall Street is projecting a 50% rise in profits this year, thanks mainly to its national debut and the 50%-plus growth of Killian 2019s. But even Pete Coors holds little hope that Zima is anything more than a fad. 201cAnheuser-Busch and Miller have sophisticated market research, and if they thought that (clear malt drinks) were going to be a major category, they 2019d be in it today, 201d he says. They 2019re not. And they don 2019t plan to be. When it comes to finding new ways to grow by developing, testing, and delivering new products more quickly and efficiently, the people at Miller have the smartest ideas these days. Says CEO Jack MacDonough: 201cI have two rallying cries: fast cycle time and very local marketing attention. 201d Miller certainly needed a kick when MacDonough,50, a former top marketer at Anheuser-Busch, came aboard two years ago. The company 2019s market share has been stuck in the low 20s since 1980. MacDonough swiftly broadened Miller 2019s portfolio of brands by buying Molson Breweries U.S.A. (the import arm of the Canadian brewer) and raised its output of new brews from an average of two per year toseven this year. Jack is nimble. Jack is quick. By getting Miller 2019s new Icehouse and Lite Ice widely distributed before Anheuser-Busch launched comparable brands, MacDonough has captured over 50% of ice beer sales in supermarkets. Anheuser 2019s share is 29%. Coors, late to the market with its Arctic Ice, is available in only 30% of the U.S. That quickness reflects fundamental changes MacDonough made in the way Miller markets. Case in point: a shift to momentum marketing, so-called because the process gets new beers flowing to consumers quickly. This enabled Miller to test its Icehouse beer inexpensively 2014 $500,000 vs. $12 million for a comparable new product tryout last year. WITH MOMENTUM marketing, instead of mounting one or two full-scale product trials each year 2014 which require costly TV commercials and retail displays 2014 you conduct half a dozen simple tests. Through its wholesalers, Miller ships prototype brew and promotional materials to 15 or so bars and restaurants in a few select cities. Miller marketers unobtrusively hang out at the test sites, observe, interview bartenders, and then do phone surveys of customers who fill out cards at the bar. Most products fail initially. In July, Citro, a lime-flavored beer, flunked its first eight-week momentum marketing tests in San Diego and Gainesville, Florida. So Citro has gone back to Miller 2019s laboratories to get revamped. MacDonough 2019s second change was to decentralize his sales organization. Says Richard Strup,41, Miller 2019s marketing chief: 201cPractically every decision used to be approved by the senior vice president of marketing in Milwaukee. I knew when I got a request to okay 15 neon signs in El Paso that this was no way to run a business. 201d That feeling was reinforced when Miller last year benchmarked companies that sell through distributors 2014 Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Gallo, the automakers 2014 and found that the most successful allow local managers to run their own shows. In January, Miller divvied up the U.S. into 19 regions and will give this shift added oomph by linking each general manager 2019s pay to his region 2019s performance. Says President John Bowlin, 43: 201cIn the spirit of empowerment, when we launched Icehouse, we didn 2019t set a price. We asked each market, 2018How much can you get for this product? You price it. 2019 201d The sales teams in the southeastern U.S. opted for an atypically high, almost import-level price, and the Southeast is now Icehouse 2019s hottest market. Coors 2019s new all-female baseball team, the Silver Bullets, is one way it hopes to propel its marketing into a league of its own. The third big change at Miller is moving to a more flexible manufacturing system. 201cFor years we had essentially two brews, Miller High Life and Miller Lite, and production was nice and straightforward, 201d says Bowlin, who was president of Philip Morris 2019s Oscar Mayer company until last year. 201cNow we have to think, 2018How can we produce to order? 2019 201d To get ideas, Bowlin and some operations managers traveled to the small town of Capehill, England, on the outskirts of Birmingham. There they studied how Bass Brewers, Britain 2019s leading beermaker, had refashioned its brewery to handle multiple, low-volume products. They concluded that Miller didn 2019t need a new brewery with small kettles and flexible production lines. Instead, the company is spending more than $500 million through 1998 to retool the six big plants it 2019s got (a seventh, in Fulton, New York, is shutting down on September 30). One early sign of progress: Shifting production from one beer to another, which used to take four hours, now takes one. Left unanswered by this frenzy of innovation and proliferation, however, is the critical question of how you expand a venerable but tired brand. Miller 2019s 21-year-old Lite (38% of company volume) has lately been losing drinkers to 12-year-old Bud Light, which has better advertising and is winning new light- beer drinkers. For now Miller is propping up the franchise with Lite Ice and shifting national marketing money to the local level to compete more nimbly against regional brands. That means, for instance, that Lite now gets plenty of television ad support in Houston, where it is the market leader. But in Portland, Oregon, where regional and European-style microbeers are the craze, local bosses have chosen to spend zero on TV ads touting their company 2019s mainstay. One thing is certain: While throwing money at a market may not capture much extra share for older brands, in a business that 2019s built on froth, cutting your marketing investment sharply is a sure-fire formula for disaster. Just ask Coors, which until recently had been supporting Coors Light, its best seller, and Zima at the expense of Original Coors. Indeed, last year 2019s $4 million in ad support was a mere one-tenth of what it spent on its flagging flagship brand in 1985. Drawing the obvious conclusion, senior vice president of marketing William Weintraub,51, a newcomer from Tropicana, is tripling Original Coors 2019s ad budget this year. Says he: 201cThis industry seems consumed by the vortex of doom phenomenon 2014 the belief that every old brand is going to die. But I genuinely think ours can be turned around. 201d That vortex of doom is Worry No. 1 at Anheuser-Busch, which has the most big, aging brands to protect. Behaving typically market leaderlike, Anheuser, with a commanding 44% of U.S. beer sales, has laid relatively low in the new- products game. Says August Busch IV,30, vice president of brand management, son of August III, and heir apparent (the family still controls 8% of the stock): 201cThe breweries that we have are designed to produce big brands. Our system is set up to sell big brands. Our competition can 2019t compete with big brands. That 2019s why they 2019ve had to introduce lots of little brands. 201d Tough talk for an unproven marketer whose ascension happened sooner than planned last March, after his predecessor unexpectedly departed. And even Busch admits that the kind of ferocious price war now under way in California, while it may intimidate smaller rivals, is hardly the message he 2019d like to send consumers about his company 2019s franchise Budweiser brand. Says he: 201cIt 2019s the worst thing in the world for brand image. 201d Critics contend that young August, though eager and reasonably smart, isn 2019t up to the job of turning Budweiser around. But August III, whom his son calls 201cChief, 201d is confident his boy can help Bud develop a much needed younger image. So far, though, he hasn 2019t done much to draw twentysomethings to the brand. What he is doing is spending $2 million to sponsor the current U.S. concert tour of the wizened but durable Rolling Stones 2014 201cthe kings of rock & roll with the king of beers, 201d he says 2014 and scrapping a disappointing 18- month-old TV campaign with the theme 201cProud to be your Bud. 201d Of the new one, due out in October, August IV spills few details. 201cIt 2019ll focus more on quality, 201d he says. 201cIt 2019s a variation of 2018this Bud 2019s for you 2019 for the Nineties. It 2019s awesome. A really cool idea. 201d As Busch strives to meet his goal of arresting Bud 2019s market share slide by next year, his company has hedged its bets by buying a minority stake in Redhook Ale Brewery, a Seattle microbrewery that sold 76,000 barrels of beer last year, vs. Anheuser 2019s 90 million. Still, the deal has drawn cheers from Anheuser 2019s distributors, who are desperate to push higher-margin, prestige brands. FOR REDHOOK, the largest microbrewer without national distribution, Anheuser 2019s investment is a ticket to coast-to-coast selling. CEO Paul Shipman,41, says that during negotiations early this year, August Busch III 201cgrabbed a pad of paper, and with one quick sweep he drew a map of the U.S. Then he said to me, 2018Put X 2019s where you want to build breweries. 2019 201d Shipman, intoxicated by opportunity, drew five. Since Anheuser disclosed its Redhook deal, other giants 2014 among them Miller and Seagram, which is not even in the beer business 2014 have reportedly been sniffing out investments in microbrewers. That prospect troubles specialty beermaker Jim Koch,45, whose Boston Beer Co. makes Samuel Adams and who has no interest in hawking his brew with Fortune 500 help. 201cI 2019m afraid of the big guys, 201d he says. 201cThey have the power to dominate any segment they want. Still, my faith is that better beer will win out. 201d Relax, Jim. The good news is that 2019s exactly what seems to be happening as consumers migrate away from the bland megabrands to tastier prestige labels. So if the beer barons really do draw the right lesson 2014 and either ape your 2013 success or buy out guys like you 2014 well, shouldn 2019t beer lovers all raise a glass to that?  ",

   "input": "The Trump campaign just opened an office in Burlingame, Calif., south of San Francisco and on the northern fringes of Silicon Valley. One recent afternoon, two volunteers were running a phone bank. Trump lawn signs were piled up, as were T-shirts. Mr. Trump has no meaningful opposition in the California primary on June 7. 201cI have great respect for Silicon Valley and all of the people in Silicon Valley, 201d the candidate said in an email message through an aide. Silicon Valley technophiles cannot necessarily claim the same. In April, as Mr. Trump was wrapping up his quest for the nomination and beginning to look ahead to the general election, a handful of people who work in tech around the country gave a grand total of $5,395 to his campaign, according to figures that will be released Thursday by Crowdpac, a start-up that tracks donations. Add that paltry sum to the $16,420 that Mr. Trump raised since last summer from people who work in tech and it is still nowhere near enough to cover the cost of a year at Stanford. Hillary Clinton has raised $2.7 million from tech donors since beginning her campaign, while Bernie Sanders has raised $6 million, according to new Crowdpac research. Mr. Trump was largely self-funding his campaign. Now, however, he requires cash 2014 and lots of it. 201cOut of the millions of people who work in technology, from engineers to Uber drivers, just 52 have given to Trump. He 2019ll need many more if he truly intends to build a world-class finance organization, 201d said Mason Harrison, a Crowdpac spokesman. 201cMitt Romney raised over $8 million from the technology sector in 2012. That 2019s a lot of money to leave on the table. 201d Whether those tech backers are out there, however, is an unsettled question. Scott Slinker, a 55-year-old entrepreneur in San Jose, Calif., gave the candidate $250 last summer. 201cI know Trump 2019s supporters are here, 201d he said. 201cThey 2019re just not vocal. They don 2019t want to be stereotyped and pigeonholed and labeled. 201d In at least some cases, this is correct. One employee at a software firm declined to speak on the record, saying it would be a bad career move for a Google search of his name to turn up any Republican connection, let alone one with Mr. Trump. Mr. Slinker, whose latest start-up, Paradata, uses big data to help brands find suppliers, said Mr. Trump was a candidate very much in the spirit of Silicon Valley: 201cHe 2019s a start-up kind of guy. He has a lot of ideas and pivots away from them if they don 2019t work, just like the Valley does. He 2019s more viral than Facebook ever was. 201d Still, even Mr. Slinker says there is good reason for the lack of enthusiasm. 201cSilicon Valley is an extremely disruptive place, but the one thing it doesn 2019t want disrupted is Silicon Valley, 201d he said. 201cAnd so it 2019s pushing back on Trump. 201d The venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who backed Mr. Romney in 2012, said on Twitter that he was supporting Mrs. Clinton. Meg Whitman, a former candidate for governor in California who now runs Hewlett Packard Enterprise, labeled Mr. Trump 201cunfit to be president. 201d When Mr. Thiel was revealed as a Trump delegate, a columnist for the tech news site Pando said he was 201cutterly ashamed 201d that Mr. Thiel was a Pando investor. Mr. Thiel declined to comment. Another Trump supporter in Silicon Valley, Tyrone Pike, had some business dealings with the candidate many years ago in Atlantic City, N.J., and was favorably impressed. As for Mr. Trump 2019s more extreme pronouncements, 201cI kind of write them off, 201d said Mr. Pike, who sold a software start-up to Citrix and is building another company. 201cHe 2019s more of a moderate than any of his words. 201d Earlier in the primaries, Mr. Trump suggested boycotting Apple if the company did not help the government crack the iPhone used by one of the attackers in the mass shooting last year in San Bernardino, Calif.; clashed with Mr. Zuckerberg over immigration; and posted on Twitter that if Amazon 201cever had to pay fair taxes, its stock would crash. 201d Bobby Franklin, the president of the National Venture Capital Association, thinks Mr. Trump will pick up support among tech people as he moderates his views. 201cThe Trump we have all witnessed for the past several months is probably not the Trump we will all be thinking about as we go into the voting booth, 201d said Mr. Franklin, whose organization does not endorse presidential candidates. 201cA general election candidate has always been different than a primary candidate. 201d Yet a few weeks ago, after Mr. Trump 2019s primary opponents all dropped out and he might have been expected to make conciliatory noises, he unloaded again on Amazon and Mr. Bezos. Mr. Trump said, among other things, that Mr. Bezos has 201cgot a huge antitrust problem because he 2019s controlling so much. 201d Mr. Bezos owns The Washington Post, which has covered Mr. Trump intensively and critically. The internet tycoon said at a Post-sponsored tech conference that he was 201cvery, very comfortable with all of Amazon 2019s approaches and behaviors, 201d The Post reported. Mr. Trump 2019s comments signal a turnabout from Amazon 2019s experience under President Obama. The retailer helped instigate and was the major beneficiary of an antitrust case the Justice Department brought against Apple and the major book publishers. Jay Carney, a former press secretary for Mr. Obama, is now senior vice president for corporate affairs at Amazon. He declined to comment. The Obama administration was even closer to Google, drawing several staff members from the search giant, including Megan Smith, the chief technology officer of the United States. Mrs. Clinton is a closer fit with Silicon Valley than Mr. Trump, both ideologically and culturally, but she is not campaigning as tech 2019s champion. Whoever wins in November, the tech community is likely to look back longingly at the last eight years. 201cThat tech is now a flash point in campaign debates is a reflection of the industry 2019s power and ubiquity in American life, 201d said Patrick Ruffini, a Republican strategist who has worked with the tech industry. 201cSilicon Valley will need to learn to expect that it won 2019t be seen as a benevolent actor in every quarter, and prepare accordingly. 201d In other words, he said, 201cthe era of Silicon Valley exceptionalism is over. 201d A version of this article appears in print on June 2,2016, on page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: Few Likes for Trump From Silicon Valley.

   "input": "SAN FRANCISCO 2014 Indus International, a computer software maker, moved to Atlanta from the frenzy of Northern California's high- technology scene earlier this year, after it paid $4.3 million to settle a passel of investor lawsuits accusing it of fraudulently overstating revenue. Executives of the once-profitable company, which sells software and services to help large corporations manage their assets, say they are confident that its revenue growth is back on track and that its bookkeeping problems are history. But Indus International ( news quote ) is not out of the woods. Not yet. Back in San Francisco, officials of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department are completing parallel investigations of the accounting methods used by the company in late 1999 that led to the investor lawsuits. They are expected to announce their findings late this month. People close to the investigation said that both civil and criminal charges against the company and former employees were under consideration in the case. Indus, in a document filed last week with the S.E.C., disclosed that it had been cooperating with the S.E.C.'s formal investigation and had offered to settle the matter without admitting or denying wrongdoing. J. Michael Highland, chief financial officer of Indus, said the company otherwise had no comment on the S.E.C. and Justice Department investigations. As if things were not difficult enough for Indus and other technology start-ups that managed to survive the Internet collapse through brutal restructuring and job cuts, many are now under investigation by law enforcement authorities for the way they recorded the ringing of their cash registers during the feverish competition of Nasdaq's bubble years. Responding to widespread concerns that investors were not always given reliable financial information in that time of frantic revenue growth, regional offices of the S.E.C., the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States attorney's office here are cooperating in a legal crackdown on accounting violations. A tough law-enforcement response to accounting irregularities, of course, is not new. In the past year, federal investigators have pursued cases of irregularities at companies like Waste Management ( news quote ), Cendant ( news quote ) and Sunbeam. But now the government is turning up the heat in Silicon Valley, home to a preponderance of questionable accounting, particularly among software companies, during the Internet boom. Over the last four years, nearly one in five accounting restatements 2014 red flags for potential misconduct 2014 have been by companies in California, according to a study by Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm. (Arthur Andersen was itself the recent subject of an S.E.C. civil sanction for the way it audited the books of Waste Management, the trash-disposal company, and agreed to a settlement without admitting or denying civil fraud allegations.) In the same four- year period, the total number of restatements for all industries has nearly doubled, Arthur Andersen's report said. So far in the technology sector, federal investigators and prosecutors here have set their sights on relatively small companies, where a high proportion of problems center on what accountants call improper revenue recognition 2014 the recording of revenue that does not exist. It could be , for example, from a pending sale that is misclassified as completed, or a service contract in which money has not yet changed hands. The Arthur Andersen study of accounting restatements from 1997 to 2000 showed that 27 percent of the restatements nationwide had been filed in the software and computer industries. About 62 percent of the software companies involved had annual gross revenue of less than $100 million. The rise of accounting fraud investigations, specifically related to overstatement of revenue, reflects a serious white-collar crime trend in the high-technology sector in recent years, said Leslie B. Caldwell, chief of the securities fraud section for the United States attorney's office here. The pressure to do this in the technology industry was intense because the expectation for growth was so high , and it wasn't sustainable, she said , without commenting on specific cases. The inquiry at Indus International focused on revenue for the third quarter of 1999. According to the shareholder lawsuits against the company and former executives, the revenue total included sales derived from irregular contracts , money that was not received during the quarter in question. Last October , Indus International agreed to settle the suits for $4.3 million without admitting or denying wrongdoing. Previously, Ms. Caldwell said, her office waited for the S.E.C. to refer cases for criminal investigation. But now, we're taking the bull in our own hands , she said. There are a number of matters under investigation of corporations that cooked their books to meet Wall Street's expectations 2014 expectations that the companies themselves created , she added.  ",

   "input": "The coastal fog along the Californian coast has declined by a third over the past 100 years 2013 the equivalent of three hours cover a day, new research shows. And it is not just bad for scenery, the reduction in the cooling effect of the fog could damage the health of the huge Redwood Forests nearby. Since 1901 , the average number of hours of fog along the coast in summer has dropped from 56 per cent to 42 per cent, which is a loss of about three hours per day, said the study leader Dr James Johnstone at the University of California. He said that it was unclear whether this is part of a natural cycle of the result of human activity , but the fog is receding because of a reduction in the difference between the temperature of the sea and the land. A cool coast and warm interior is one of the defining characteristics of California's coastal climate , but the temperature difference between the coast and interior has declined substantially in the last century, in step with the decline in summer fog, he added. His findings , published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, came from weather records kept at airports along the coast. Professor Todd Dawson, co-author, said the decline could be disastrous for the nearby ecosystems. Fog prevents water loss from Redwoods in summer , and is really important for both the tree and the forest, he said. If the fog is gone , we might not have the Redwood forests we do now.  ",

Abbe Diaz , who spent several years as a maitre d' at some of Manhattan's poshest restaurants, has the dish on stars' bad behavior - and the regal Country Strong star is among those she roasts on her PXThis blog and the books it has spawned. So while Paltrow tries to recast herself as a relatable mom (see the new Good Housekeeping cover) , Diaz maintains she's got some work to do. After serving Paltrow about a half dozen times in her years as a maitre d' (from 2000 to 2004), Diaz says the actress has a passive-aggressive comportment 2026 meant to unnerve the plebeians. If you're not worthy , it's like you're not there, the author tells us , although she adds, Paltrow likes boys - servers , that is - as long as they're cute and sweet. Diaz first made a splash with insider restaurant gossip on her blog , PXThis. PX stands for personne extraordinaire - French for VIP and restaurant code for celebrity bookings. She turned her experiences into the diary-style book PX This. A second , PX Me: How I Became a Published Author , Got Micro-Famous, and Married a Millionaire, arrives in June. It will describe Diaz's brushes with Internet infamy , including feuds with Gawker and former employer Jean-Georges Vongerichten. Her celeb stories aren't all bile, however. She says Will Smith is a huge , huge tipper - like 100%. Stars like that seem to remember what it's like to struggle a little bit for your cash , she concludes. But not all do: Ex-restaurateur (and a former Diaz boss) Brian McNally once expressed surprise that Ellen Barkin wasn't nicer to the staff - because he'd dated the actress back when she was waiting tables. Diaz dealt with Barkin several times when she dined with Julianne Moore , who was polite to the point of being apologetic. Overcompensating , Diaz speculates. Some stars aren't even nice to each other. Diaz recalls seeing designers Marc Jacobs and the late Alexander McQueen , each with an entourage, at adjacent lunch tables 2014 and each table acting like the other wasn't even there. The toughest customers , she says, are niche VIPs, like magazine editors, who go unnoticed by most NYers but are used to royal treatment within their worlds. Real A-listers hesitate to wield clout. Once, for example, a colleague of Diaz's failed to recognize Hilary Swank and turned her away. She was a little surprised , Diaz says , but clearly didn't want to say anything. Fortunately, the misunderstanding was sorted out. Celebrities can count on happy endings - or at least a table.

I've been so moved lately by the tragic loss of life and I hoped for a positive statement that would bring us ALL together. ONE LOVE. 2014 Remigio of TheTenors (@RemigioPereira) July 13, 2016 Born in Boston, Pereira and his Portuguese parents moved to Ottawa before his first birthday. Instead of enrolling their son in music lessons, his folks focused on getting him on the ice. 201cIn Canada, it is hockey by day and hockey by night, 201d Pereira told the Metro West Daily News in 2013. 201cAs a boy, all I did was play hockey. As a teenager, though, I sustained an injury that made me realize that my dreams of one day playing competitive hockey in the NHL were squashed. 201d At 21, Pereira was studying classical guitar at the University of Ottawa. After being approached by fellow musicians, his pipes came into play. 201cWhile I was at University, there were some singers who had heard something in my speaking voice and so they approached me and said, 2018Hey, do you sing?' 201d Pereira shared with Poll Star in January. 201cSure enough, by the end of the year they convinced me to sing for them.

Well, he 2019s all grown up now, and Sir Richard Branson wants him to relive his youth with Sex Pistols credit cards, which were launched on June 7 and feature the cover the band 2019s 1977 album 201cNever Mind the Bollocks, Here 2019s the Sex Pistols. 201d Branson got his start with Virgin Records in 1973, and four years later, the seminal British punk band, the Sex Pistols, joined the label. After such successes as Virgin Atlantic and Virgin Mobile, Branson launched Virgin Money, a bank and financial services company originally called Virgin Direct and founded in 1995. Virgin Money is backing these new Sex Pistols cards, which come with a variable 18.9 percent APR. Some may be tempted to cry 201cSellout! 201d However, at least one Sex Pistol has been involved in a commercial venture before. Former frontman John Lydon 2013 known back then as Johnny Rotten 2013 appeared in a 2008 British television spot for Country Life butter. And apparently, it was good business 2013 Country Life 2019s parent company, Dairy Crest, reported that Lydon 2019s advertisement had helped sales increase by 85 percent in just one quarter. It also wasn 2019t the first time legendary punk rock artists had their music used to hawk a brand 2019s wares. Here 2019s a look at a few more. Nike (Iggy and the Stooges 2013 201cSearch and Destroy 201d) 201cSearch and Destroy 201d is the lead track on the 1973 album 201cRaw Power 201d by Iggy and the Stooges. The band broke up before punk took hold, but they 2019re considered a primary influence and lead singer Iggy Pop has been called 201cThe Godfather of Punk 201d countless times. 201cSearch and Destroy 201d was used to promote Nike Air sneakers during the 1996 Summer Olympics, just as the 1977 Iggy Pop heroin anthem 201cLust for Life 201d was used in a Royal Caribbean Cruises TV spot. The latter commercial caused the satirical publication The Onion to run an article titled 201cSong About Heroin Used To Advertise Bank. 201d Diet Pepsi (The Ramones 2019- 201cBlitzkrieg Bop 201d) The Ramones have been called 201cthe first punk rock band 201d by MTV and a great many others. Their two-minute, three-chord songs recall a hybrid of Black Sabbath and the Beach Boys, and though every single original member of the band is no longer with us, they continue to influence bands to this day. Diet Pepsi used their 1976 song 201cBlitzkrieg Bop 201d in a 2005 commercial, but they weren 2019t the only ones to do so. It has also been used to advertise the Coppertone Sport Pro Series, the Cartoon Network and Taco Bell. Watch the 2005 ad here: AARP (The Buzzcocks 2013 201cEverybody 2019s Happy Nowadays 201d) The Buzzcocks are less well-known than the Stooges and the Ramones, but no less significant. The British band shared stages with the Clash and the Sex Pistols during punk rock 2019s heyday, and even had the distinction of seeing their songs banned by BBC radio. In 2007, AARP, formerly known as the American Association of Retired Persons, used one of their songs in a commercial. The song was 201cEverybody 2019s Happy Nowadays 201d and the commercial depicted energetic people of various ages at a birthday party, with a tag line that read, 201cAn organization for people who have birthdays. 201d Since it opened up its membership to anyone over 50, retired or not, the song may have been used as a gambit to disabuse people of the notion that it 2019s an organization for mildewed pensioners. Dunlop Tyres ( 201cVenus In Furs 201d 2013 The Velvet Underground) The repertoire of punk forerunners the Velvet Underground includes such tracks as 201cSweet Jane, 201d an upbeat number ideal for promoting any product. But Dunlop Tyres, a British subsidiary of Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, decided to use the S&M anthem 201cVenus in Furs 201d instead for a 1993 spot. According to the advertising publication Campaign, this was not an oversight. 201cTyres are invariably distress purchases, making branding difficult, 201d it said. 201cDunlop attempted to change that with a visual tour de force aimed at fixing its name firmly in drivers 2019 minds 2026 Set to the Velvet Underground 2019s Venus in Furs, the ad had a nightmarish quality and was one of the most original and controversial creations of the 90s. 201d Nissan (The Clash 2013 201cPressure Drop 201d) The Clash 2019s 1979 recording of 201cPressure Drop 201d found its way into a commercial for the 2008 Nissan Rogue, presumably because it 2019s the most punk rock mid-size crossover SUV in automotive history. Prior to that, their song 201cLondon Calling 201d had appeared in commercials for the Jaguar X-Type, but writer Rob Walker said in The Boston Globe that anti-capitalist punk songs are as good as any other when it comes to advertising. 201cWhere you or I might hear a counterculture anthem, there is also a collection of sounds and lyrical bites ready to be stripped for parts, 201d he wrote. 201cFrom an ad-maker 2019s point of view, even the most edgy rock 2018n 2019 roll is just so much musical wallpaper. 201d Daniel Bukszpan is a New York-based freelance writer.

On the other side is the camp that wants to engage with the companies, particularly through shareholder proxies, to push for action on climate change. The issue can be overwhelming. The science is complicated. We get it. This is your cheat sheet. Groups like the Tri-State Coalition for Responsible Investment, as well as New York State and City officials, recently presented at Exxon Mobil 2019s annual shareholder meeting proposals that would require the company to assess the business risks of meeting the Paris climate goals and to 201cacknowledge the moral imperative 201d to keep global temperatures from rising by more than two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) since the start of the industrial era; they also helped to pass a resolution giving shareholders greater say in corporate governance. Shareholder action has improved corporate responsibility on many fronts, said Sister Patricia Daly, a Dominican sister of Caldwell, N.J., who is the executive director of the Tri-State Coalition for Responsible Investment. 201cCompanies know the work we have put on their desk is beneficial, 201d she said in a recent interview, and cited the emergence of sustainability directors and efforts by many companies to reduce their emissions. 201cI 2019m confident we have really initiated that over the decades, 201d she said. More fundamentally, a split is growing between the large, traditional environmental groups that try to work with companies and the scrappy campaigners who stand proudly outside. Naomi Klein, an author on environmental and economic issues, has sharply criticized what she called 201ca very deep denialism in the environmental movement among the big green groups, 201d like the Environmental Defense Fund, which has worked with fossil-fuel companies to research methane leaks and to pursue market-based solutions to the climate crisis, like putting a price on carbon. Ms. Klein argues that capitalism inherently worsens climate change. Working within the system as the institutional players do, she has said, is 201cmore damaging than the right-wing denialism in terms of how much ground we 2019ve lost. 201d Mr. McKibben said the kind of noisy activism that characterizes the work of organizations like 350.org helps correct what he sees as the institutional inertia of the established groups. He said the lack of mass-movement activism was a key reason behind the failure of legislation like the 2010 effort to develop a system to limit and put a price on greenhouse gas emissions. 201cIf we 2019re going to win the climate fight, it will come with a change in the zeitgeist, 201d he said. 201cAnd that 2014 not particular pieces of legislation 2014 is the ultimate point of building movements. 201d Fred Krupp, the president of the Environmental Defense Fund, disagreed. Working with industry, he said, had helped deepen the understanding of such issues as methane leakage, which could produce remedies. 201cMore and more businesses want to be part of the solution, 201d Mr. Krupp said. Collaborative efforts helped lead to last month 2019s bipartisan passage of an overhaul of toxic substances legislation, he said, adding, 201cAnd we 2019re getting close to being able to do it with climate change. 201d Given these fault lines on various issues, a question naturally arises: Are they hurting the overall environmental movement? Even on that question, there are disagreements. For Matthew Nisbet, an expert in environmental communications at Northeastern University, there is a risk that differences of opinion within the movement could lead to greater enmity over time, resulting in a lack of focus. Progress could be lost, he said, 201cif they start to see each other as rivals and opponents, and they lose sight of broader climate goals and their true opponents. 201d But many in the various factions of the movement say that there is more agreement than it may seem from afar. Mr. Krupp said that although tactics and technologies may differ, consensus has emerged on many points. 201cWe have to keep most of the fossil fuels in the ground, 201d he said. 201cWe all agree with that. The math dictates that. We all agree that the conversion to clean energy should be as quick as possible. 201d Of natural gas, he said, 201cit 2019s an exit ramp, not a bridge. 201d The movement to combat climate change is building an even bigger tent as more nations, businesses, religious groups and even conservatives have committed to dealing with the threat of rising seas and changing weather. The number of Republicans speaking out in favor of climate action is growing, with the emergence of climate-oriented conservative groups like R Street and the efforts of Jay Faison, a philanthropist who has pledged millions of dollars to support candidates willing to buck the party 2019s orthodoxy on climate change. Ellen Dorsey, the executive director of the Wallace Global Fund, which has promoted the divestment of fossil-fuel holdings and investment in cleaner technologies, has called disagreements within the green camp 201cnoises around the margin. 201d She predicted that a combination of high-level collaboration and street-level activism would hold governments to their Paris climate pledges and push back against recalcitrant business interests. Ultimately, Mr. Gore said in a recent telephone interview, economics may accomplish much of what governments have so far failed to do. Plunging costs of renewable energy make it more competitive than ever with fossil fuels. Similarly, the former vice president said, the biggest obstacle for nuclear power could be the expense of building new reactors. 201cI don 2019t have a theological opposition to nuclear power, 201d he said. 201cIt 2019s simply not cost competitive. 201d Mr. Gore said that tensions among climate change activists follow the traditions of the civil rights movement, abolition, women 2019s suffrage and gay and lesbian rights. 201cIn all such movements, there have been schisms, and minor splits as well, 201d he added. 201cIt 2019s just a natural feature of the human condition. 201d  ",

   "input": "A decade into the 21st century, no clear movement or style has emerged to mark contemporary art. No Impressionism, Modernism, Minimalism 2014no single description to encapsulate what has been going on. Veteran art dealer Michael Findlay, in The Value of Art: Money , Power, Beauty, says that a name has been there all along: Commercialism. In a book that dissects the past 40 years of the business , Mr. Findlay decries the rise of art as an asset class, the circus that auctions have become and the fact that, as the prices have climbed, we've stopped looking at the paintings themselves. The greatest consequence of the commoditization of art is the loss of integrity of the object because it is with the integrity of the object that all lasting , true value lies, Mr. Findlay says. And: One of the signs of a decaying culture is a reverence for form over content. When Edvard Munch's The Scream sold for $119.9 million on May 2 , Mr. Findlay must have clapped his hands on his cheeks, aghast. But wait a minute. Mr. Findlay is a well-known member of this commoditized art world: a downtown art dealer in New York during SoHo's 1960s and '70s heyday; the head of Impressionist and Modern art at Christie's beginning in the 1980s, when the 20th-century art boom really began to roar; currently a director of Acquavella Galleries, where the client list has included casino magnate Steve Wynn and billionaire hedge-fund manager Steve Cohen. Mr. Findlay and his own sales patter have been at the center of the modern art market for decades. From the first page, then, The Value of Art is something akin to an antiwar treatise by Napoleon: You grant the expertise but question the repentance. Mr. Findlay divides the book into four sections , naming the first three for Zeus's daughters, the Three Graces, to show various components of art. Thalia, as the goddess of fruitfulness, he says, represents commerce. He uses this section for an introduction to the workings of the art market. Euphrosyne, the goddess of joy, stands in for society; in this social section , Mr. Findlay passes along his own, entertaining view of the art world's evolution over the past few decades. He describes a Christie's-sponsored tour of collectors' homes in 1995 when the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art opened its new building. Mr. Findlay was one of the tour guides, he says, as a fleet of coaches drove the visiting eminences from Rothkos and champagne to Warhols and caviar. When the coach he was riding in got stuck on a hairpin turn in Napa Valley , he says, the driver was treated to gratuitous instructions shouted from the rear by a billionaire East Coast hedge-fund mogul whose soon-to-be ex-wife just as loudly contradicted him. In the section called Aglaea , for the goddess of beauty, the author champions the essential, intrinsic value of art 2014a subject he addresses with passion. The final section is called Marley's Ghost: Past , Present, Future but concentrates on the present , tossing delightful barbs at the art scene under subheadings such as Posh Lust. Collectors are frantically shopping for the artists today who will stand the test of time , he says, but what if virtually none of them do? Entire generations of artists have been filler between great movements in art history. Could we be in one of those dead zones now? For all his tart views, Mr. Findlay generally does not name names. But archetypes do emerge. The cunning, sought-after artist who convinces collectors that each of them has had a personal moment with him. The hanger-on who waits until the gallery opening is finishing to overhear where the free dinner with be. The greedy , dry-eyed children who hawk art from their parents' estates. And the art collector himself , drinking single-malt scotch, wearing Lobb loafers, lounging on a Michel Frank sofa in his second home in Aspen. Unforgiving of these dead-on types, Mr. Findlay is best when he confesses how he has fitted in with them. He slams auction catalogs that canonize sellers, for example, but admits: I am guilty of more than my fair share . . . of eye-glazing flattery. Although he is most acerbic about the contemporary-art scene , Mr. Findlay is also unhappy about the museum world. Something has gone wrong, he says, when the curators of museum exhibitions seem most interested in trying to tell a story with the works of art as illustrations. He slaps the tribe of zombies who stagger through shows while listening to audio guides. (He recounts seeing a headphone-wearing woman shush a man who was talking in a museum gallery , though the man knew what he was talking about 2014he was the curator on the tape she was listening to.) Mr. Findlay also has little patience for opening-night museum guests who skip the show and race to the reception for salmon on toast points and a chance to switch the place cards at your dinner table. Throughout The Value of Art , Mr. Findlay offers much sage advice. If you're thinking of becoming a collector and having a family , be prepared for your children to resent the art. He tells of one little girl who taught her cat to climb inside her parents' expensive sculptures. The book's wisest tip: Really look at art and buy it for its aesthetic pleasure, not as an investment. The market is too cyclical, with prices tethered to faddish taste. Art-investment funds offer little protection, he says, noting that the only fund that ever had a great success was organized in 1904 when a group of friends in Paris pooled their money to buy a spectacular Picasso, among other works. In 1914 the group sold the collection, quadrupling their money. Three months later, Archduke Ferdinand was assassinated in Sarajevo, and interest in buying art collapsed with the first shots of World War I. So were the collectors brilliant or just lucky? Mr. Findlay might say that they were lucky 2014to have had a decade to enjoy the Picasso. Ms. Peers writes on art and culture in New York.  ",

On Apr. 25,1901, New York Governor Benjamin Odell Jr. signed into law a bill requiring owners of motor vehicles to register with the state. It also mandated that the every automobile or motor cycle bear 201cthe separate initials of the owner 2019s name placed upon the back thereof in a conspicuous place, the letters forming such initials to be at least three inches in height. 201d Owners were expected to provide their own identifying letters, and in those early days there were no restrictions on materials, style or color. Some used metal house letters on leather or wood, others painted the letters directly on their vehicles, according to license plate collector and historian Keith Marvin. Though the new law put an extra burden on drivers, they were left 201crejoicing 201d at news the bill was signed, wrote the New York Tribune. The reason was that, before the law passed, local regulations often differed 2014which meant that not only were the laws hard to follow, but also that drivers often found themselves losing out to people who got around the old-fashioned way. As the New York Times reported, 201cautomobilists found that in many instances they were not accorded equal rights with the drivers of horses, and the confusion resulting from these various laws led to the need of a uniform standard. 201d Get your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter It wasn 2019t a wild idea in 1901 that automobiles were suffering from the lack of official acknowledgement: the New York Tribune later echoed that 201cone of the objects of the law was to put a stop to the harassing of the owners of automobiles with local regulations, 201d and the journal Turf, Field and Farm called cars an 201cunnatural vehicle 201d in their reporting on the bill. After the licensing and registration law passed, however, local authorities 2014even if they controlled a highway or street 2014could not ban cars from using it. The law also imposed a minimum speed limit (8 mph in cities and 15 mph in rural areas) below which local speed limits could not go. On May 2, the Times reported that 17 people had already applied for licenses and a man named George F. Chamberlain would receive the first one. By September the Tribune reported 715 had applied, and licenses totaled 1,566 by the beginning of April the following year, according to Marvin. But, as the number of cars and drivers increased, the painted-on-initials system began to fail, for a simple reason: There were just too many people with the same initials. Hence, the modern license-plate. On May 15,1903, the state legislature passed a new law requiring the New York Secretary of State to assign each registered owner a number that would be displayed on the back of the vehicle. And that same year 2014though New York drivers would have to provide their own plates until 1910 2014Massachusetts became the first to distribute state-issued plates.  ",

   "input": "This is the second in a series of six posts on salary negotiation published in partnership with PayScale.com. As with so many things in life 2014relationships, comedy, investing in the stock market 2014getting a raise can depend on good timing. If you 2019ve done your salary research, know what you 2019re worth in the job market and have determined a pay increase is warranted, you 2019re far more likely to get it if you think strategically about when to have the raise conversation with your boss. Here are just a few things to think about before you mark a date on your calendar: Synching Up with Your Company 2019s Performance Review Schedule If your company has a regular performance review schedule, try to have a conversation about your compensation a couple months in advance so that your boss has time to make a case and advocate for budget ahead of that process. If you wait until the performance review process is underway, often the decisions about salary increases have already been made by the management team. It doesn 2019t mean that an exception won 2019t be made, but the easier you make it for your manager, the smoother the whole negotiation process will go. Taking the Internal Temperature at Your Company Even if the data shows that you 2019re making less than you should be, that might not be enough to convince your employer to increase your pay if the company at large isn 2019t faring well. The best time to ask for a raise is when revenue is on the rise, after a major financial win (especially one you helped with) or when the company is generally in a strong position. If you 2019ve just had a round of layoffs, a raise conversation is unlikely to go in your favor. If you believe in the company, you may want to stick it out. But, if the death bell is tolling for your employer, looking elsewhere might be the best bet for improving your own financial wellbeing. Staying on Top of Industry Trends Taking a broader look at your industry and understanding the external forces that may be impacting it may help with timing your raise discussion, and will also help you make good, strategic decisions about your career overall. When the Internet started becoming more of a content destination, those journalists who saw the writing on the wall and made the move from print to online early on are certainly patting themselves on the back. It pays to understand if you 2019re in a thriving or dying industry and whether the lean times are temporary (e.g. real estate) or lasting. If you deserve a raise, you should ask for one, but good timing can mean the difference between a small bump and a significant jump.

Libya 2019s state-controlled National Oil Co. said it was taking steps to restart exports from three blocked oil ports after the government reached a deal with local guards that had blocked the facilities during a pay dispute. The deal could help revive Libya 2019s sagging oil exports, which have been curtailed as various factions fight for control of this North African nation. In a statement Sunday, the National Oil Co. said it 201cunconditionally 201d welcomed a deal between Libya 2019s unity government and the Petroleum Facilities Guards to reopen three eastern ports. The guards, an autonomous force that operates like a militia, had blocked them for 18 months, claiming they weren't getting paid. The state oil company said it 201cwill now start working 201d to resume exports, including calling back staff to work and talking to international oil buyers. But it warned there were still security and political obstacles before the first ship can be loaded, without providing more details. Higher production from Libya would add more oil to a global glut that has seen prices drop by more than half since mid-2014. After a recent oil-price rally, prices have again sagged due to resurgent production in Africa and the Middle East. National Oil Co. chairman Mustafa Sanalla, who had opposed tying monetary payments to PFG leader Ibrahim Jathran in return for guards reopening the ports, said he received guarantees from the country 2019s presidential council that no improper payments would be made. 201cI am pleased the presidential council agrees that we cannot reward individuals who hold Libya 2019s oil hostage, 201d Mr. Sanalla said in the statement Sunday. A PFG spokesman confirmed a deal had been reached but didn 2019t return a request for comment on its content. A presidential council adviser on oil matters didn 2019t return a request for comment. A National Oil Co. spokesman declined to comment. The three ports set to reopen 2014Zueitina, Es Sider and Ras Lanuf 2014have the capacity to export over 600,000 barrels a day. But they may not be able to load more than 100,000 barrels a day because of attacks by Islamic State and other armed groups, Mr. Sanalla said in a recent letter to the United Nations. The letter also complained about the risk of improper payments to Mr. Jathran. A spokesman for Mr. Jathran declined to comment on Mr. Sanalla 2019s allegations but said a 201ckey issue that was resolved was over two years of back salaries due to the PFG. 201d Overall, the National Oil Co. said nationwide oil production could increase by 150,000 barrels a day, from about 400,000 barrels a day, within two weeks, thanks to fresh government funding. Provided talks with other groups that have blocked output in Southern oil fields bear fruit, nationwide production could more than double to 900,000 barrels a day, it said.

   "input": "When I arrived at Aunan Lodge, a neat clutch of wood cabins on the east bank of the Orkla, I was on a sporting debut of my own. I had never been to a fishing lodge, let alone tried for salmon before, and I had been warned not to set my expectations too high. Salmon are awkward customers. From early spring, the fish slowly work their way up from the seawater fjord at Trondheim towards their autumn spawning grounds in the shallow gravel beds of headwaters far upstream. The progress they make upriver depends on many factors, including the water levels throughout the summer. Read more: 19 landscapes that prove Norway is the most beautiful country in Europe Catching them is even more of a mystery. The fish don 2019t eat once they re-enter the river in which they were born, and no one knows why they snap at the brightly coloured flies cast into eddies and pools by fishermen. If you are new to a river, you don 2019t stand a chance of working out where the fish are without the advice of a local guide. A fish might see the lure only if it is cast within a few feet of it. So after he had shown me around my accommodation 2013 in a turf-roofed cabin called Anfield, where each bedroom is hung with footballing memorabilia 2013 Vegard introduced me to Kris, who was to be my guide to the river and its mysteries. He kitted me out with waders, a rod and a tin of flies, and we climbed into his four-wheel drive to head for our first beat 2013 from the banks of the Pollen rapids, around the edge of the Gamsholen pool and along the fast, shallow, gravelly stretch called Strupen, where a big salmon had been landed the day before. I am not an accomplished fisherman. I did have a purple patch on the rivers of Iceland a few years ago, so I know roughly how to cast a trout fly. But salmon rods require a different, double-handed technique to launch the long arc of line across the river. Experts can land the fly exactly where they want it with scarcely a ripple and let it drift downstream. Could I do the same? Read more: Norway travel guide After an hour or so, with Kris 2019s help, I had a workable technique. It was never exactly graceful, but it had rhythm, and that is what counts. Fishing is all about pace and rhythm. It 2019s about the flow of the water around your waders, the slow footsteps as you edge downstream after each cast, the quiet concentration, the pleasure of watching the line spool out towards the far bank. My three-day stay soon settled into a longer rhythm, too, driving or walking down to our beat in the morning and afternoon, and heading back to the main lodge 2013 a converted potato barn 2013 for hearty lunches and dinners in the company of a handful of other fishermen. The talk was convivial and, at least until the video of Vegard 2019s best goals came out, focused on fish. The pick of those goals was his winning header for Rosenborg against AC Milan in the Champions League quarter-final of 1996, while Silvio Berlusconi looks on miserably. It 2019s one of the great moments of Norwegian football. The river Orkla is about an hour from Trondheim (Photo: AP Fotolia) You may have guessed by now that something was missing. It was nothing to do with my casting, I 2019m sure. It was the weather. Our timing had been unlucky. While conditions on our first afternoon were good, a late August storm blew in from the North Sea, and deposited several inches of rain over the Norwegian mountains. I woke the next morning to see the river swelling over the banks and whole trees being swept downstream. We still managed to fish, but I could tell from Kris 2019s demeanour that the prospects were not good. Visibility in the churning water had dropped to nearly zero. We 2019d need to be casting right on top of a fish to stand any chance of it seeing the fly. Though we didn 2019t hook him, we did at least catch a glimpse of our salmon. There was a surreal moment on the final morning, when Norwegian television had turned up to interview Vegard about his campaign to protect wild salmon. They wanted to film a few visiting fishermen, and as I stood in the river and talked to the interviewer, I sensed a swirl in the water a few feet away. In a glittering flash of silver, a salmon broke the surface, leapt three feet into the air, stuck out its tongue at the camera and shot off upstream. It was huge. Honest. And if you don 2019t believe me, you can see it below (video courtesy of Norwegian TV2) So, I 2019ve learnt two things from my first stint on a salmon river. First, that trying to catch one is just as hard and uncertain as, well, scoring a Premier League goal. Second, salmon fishing is not all about catching salmon. It 2019s about just being there. About forgetting that the rest of the world exists, slowing your heart rate, and feeling at one with the river and its landscapes. I 2019m not going to give up my quest, however. I 2019m hooked. And as we all know, the longer you wait, the more chance there is that three will come along at once.

   "input": "There 2019s a professor at Harvard University who 2019d like to take all your cash, and not for tuition. In a witty new book, 201cThe Curse of Cash, 201d economist Kenneth Rogoff argues the human race would be better off without paper money. He 2019s onto something. The US is adopting digital payment systems so universal and 2014 in theory 2014 so secure there will be little need for cash. But America is taking its sweet time about it. Those annoying new credit card readers are one disappointing example. They 2019re old news in the rest of the world; ours are painfully slow, not as secure as they could be and not even available in most places. The US led the way in pay-by-smartphone services like Apple Pay,Samsung Pay and Android Pay, but too few places accept them. Meanwhile in much of the world, you can buy small items by simply tapping a card against the terminal. No signature, no PIN, no nothing. Here in the US, we use a similar technology to ride the subway. But for buying most other things, forget about it. As a fan of all things digital, and of privacy, I 2019ve got mixed feelings about all this. In a fully cash-free society, government agencies could maintain constant surveillance on every dime we spend. For now, things aren 2019t that bad because digital payment systems aren 2019t that good. And yet, there 2019s no denying the efficiency and security of digital payments. I may insist on my right to stuff a mattress with paper money, but in everyday life, I hardly ever use the stuff. And I 2019m not alone. A recent Gallup survey found that 53 percent of Americans rarely or never use cash, up from 43 percent five years ago. And if the latest technologies live up to their promise, they could deliver the cashless society of Dr. Rogoff 2019s dreams. Old-school credit cards with their insecure magnetic 201cswipe 201d strips are a poor substitute for cash, because they 2019re so easy to counterfeit. The new chip-based cards solve the problem with a digital code that 2019s almost impossible to fake. But reading the code can take twice as long as swiping. Card issuers Visa and MasterCard have begun using new processing software that 2019s supposed to work much faster. America 2019s chip cards usually don 2019t require users to enter a PIN number, as we do at our debit cards. The 201cchip-and-PIN 201d approach is used in much of the world, and makes it almost impossible for thieves to use a lost or stolen card. Retailers Walmart and Home Depot are suing the card companies, to force them to adopt the chip-and-PIN standard. But for millions, it 2019s a moot point. A February survey from Boston Retail Partners found only 22 percent of US retailers were even taking chip cards. Upgrading all 13.9 million American payment terminals will take a while. These upgrades will also let retailers accept smartphone payments from Apple Pay and Android Pay. Activated by the user 2019s fingerprint, these systems transmit encrypted financial data through a radio chip inside the phone. But of the nation 2019s 3.7 million retail stores, only a million or so now let you pay this way. Besides, fewer than half of Americans have an Apple or Android phone that 2019s payment-capable, according to the Auriemma Consulting Group. And even those with the right kind of phone make fewer than 20 percent of their purchases with it. The simplest of all cash alternatives, the 201ctap-and-go 201d card, is popular in many nations but virtually unknown here. These are credit cards that work like Apple Pay. You just touch it to the terminal to make a payment. They only work for small transactions of around $50 or less. Banks tried issuing tap-and-go cards in the US a decade ago, but virtually no retailers accepted them. The new smartphone-compatible terminals can handle them, so they may at last gain traction in America. That would eliminate our last rationale for carrying a few ones and fives. Harvard 2019s Rogoff has been railing against cash for decades and it looks like financial technology is catching up with him. In a few years the bugs will be worked out and we 2019ll have payment systems that are secure, efficient, and devoid of privacy. And to judge by current trends, more of of us will happily use them. Even me.  ",

Congressional Democrats have seized on the use of a private email addresses by Powell and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as a foil for Republican attacks on Clinton. By suggesting that he didn't view work conducted via private email as a permanent government record , Powell could offer those Democrats additional ammunition. The emails were posted on the website DCLeaks.com, a website which has been alleged to be an outlet for hackers tied to the Russian intelligence groups. The website - which says it intends to expose the misuse of political power - has previously released emails from other Washington political figures.  ",

But it is one that Nico Deportago-Cabrera has managed to master the past nine years through periods of trial and error, and cause and effect. Deportago-Cabrera accepted his first courier job more out of necessity than desire. Now he is hooked on this open-air office space being his world as he traverses the streets of downtown Chicago as one of the city's 300 bicycle messengers. Like most members of the eclectic bike-messenger community, Deportago-Cabrera had to learn how each city has its own vibe. Its own energy. Its own pace. To truly become one with this bumper-to-bumper world, bike messengers must first understand their place in it to survive. It was literally being in traffic and the sensation I got when I was in between lanes in thick traffic , Deportago-Cabrera says of the job's appeal. You kind of look and there's this canyon of cars and buildings. It's like that scene in Star Wars where they're flying down the corridor to the Death Star. Given the uneven ratio of automobiles to delivery bikes , there is an inherent risk of working the daily messenger beat.

But for Deportago-Cabrera and the myriad others who share a love for his line of work, this isn't just a job. It is living. Pure unadulterated living. Turnover within the messenger community is high. But for those who figure out how to survive -- and thrive -- on a daily basis, reward is measured in ways those outside the community cannot imagine. Especially when taken to the extreme. Deportagago-Cabrera recently captured his second men's North American Cycle Courier Championship in Brooklyn, laying claim to a title usually accompanied by nothing more than bragging rights. Christina Peck of San Francisco was the women's and overall champion. For nearly three hours on a rain-drenched Sunday afternoon in October, Deportago-Cabrera covered a 17-block course blocked off by police barricades against 71 other finalists charged with making as many pick-ups and deliveries as humanly possible. The annual event, which started in 1998 in Montreal and is more commonly known among messenger racers as the NACCC, brings together hundreds of cyclists for a weekend that is as much about celebrating the community as it is about the racing itself. The concept of the NAAAC is ironically silly: A collection of money-strapped messengers who often spend their nights on couches of strangers to avoid costly hotel charges act as if they are working while on their days off. The faces are familiar, both among top-notch competitors and the also-rans alike. But for those who have managed to set themselves apart from the field 2013 widely recognized riders like Austin Horse, Peck and now, Deportago-Cabrera 2013 three days worth of warehouse parties, art crawls and non-sanctioned races through city streets, known as alley cats, culminates in three hours of proving their worth to their fellow bike messengers. But within the community, there is honor in being the best. It's totally like street cred , says Deportago-Cabrera , who won his first NACCC in 2009 in Boston, only a year after he started working as a messenger. When somebody rolls up and you know that they're the champ of that year , it's like instant respect. It's like the same with any of these races. You might win a messenger bag or a bike frame, but really, we really enjoy being able to say, 'I'm the fastest.' To claim a title , champions oft-times need to blend speed with strategy. At the NACCC, winners are determined by the amount of money earned during the course of the three-hour event. Racers work based on rate sheets and delivery zones , both of which are handed to competitors on pieces of papers before the NACCC final begins. In addition to all-day delivery assignments that are valued on a fictional base rate, racers also have bonus opportunities called rushes and double rushes. These have time limits that add anywhere from $2 to $6 to the base rate, and they're on a manifold that includes 11 checkpoints. When, if and how many of the delivery zones competitors hit throughout the afternoon is up to individual racers. Although traffic doesn't factor into strategy because of the closed course nature of the final, ultimate success often comes down to a mental game and a reliable Google Maps smartphone app 2013 especially among top-tier competitors. For Peck,30, who has worked off and on in the field the past nine years both on the West Coast and Chicago, out-thinking the competition has served her well throughout her messenger racing career. Peck won her sixth NACCC title this year, when she 2013 for third time 2013 posted the best overall finish and topped Deportago-Cabrera and the rest of the field by collecting $300 in NACCC dollars 2013 $19 more than her Chicago-based counterpart. Peck's victory in Brooklyn came a year after she captured her first courier cycling world championships in Australia in which her strategy of not worrying about how fast she was covering the course compared to the rest of the field again came in handy. You know there's definitely not a lot of room to make mistakes , says Peck , who holds a sponsorship with All-City Cycles and works on a daily basis for Godspeed Couriers. What my upper hand is in that situation is the fact that I'm being really smart and that I'm on top of it. I'm still fast 2013 I'm probably faster than a handful of the guys that are out there 2013 but I'm not as fast as some of the top dudes. So to beat those guys , I have to be super on top of everything. Peck makes sure she has even the smallest of details covered and thinks out her course based largely on what makes the most logistical sense. Fueled by the competitive nature that has always consumed her since he was playing soccer , competing in horse jumping shows and running while growing up in Southern California, Peck cut her teeth on alley-cat races. Then she moved up the scale, leading to multiple NACCC championships and the world title in 2015. Once she won her first NACCC in Boston in 2009, Peck was hooked for good. I don't think there's a lot of things I enjoy that I'm bad at , Peck says. I think it's a lot easier to keep going back when you have a title to defend. It's like when I first won in Boston , I was like, 'Well, s----, I guess I'm pretty good at this 2013 why would I not want to come back?' But it's fun to see if (a win) was a fluke or it was something I could repeat or when you're at the top and there's no place else to go, you want to keep maintaining that. For top-level messenger racers , organization plays a critical role. The closed-course nature of the NACCC final puts competitors on as even of a playing field as possible. But because an unexpected hurdle can throw things off kilter, charting the right course often sets top competitors apart from the rest of the field. The entire race requires constant thinking ahead and understanding that even what seems to be an insignificant decision can spell the difference between victory and merely a Top-5 finish. But for those who have won courier cycling titles at both the North American and world championship levels, grasping how fellow top competitors think and operate plays into individual strategy. That's where Austin Horse enters the conversation. When asked for his racing resume, Horse can't recall how many NACCC championships he has captured. Horse is widely known as one of the world's fastest and most organized messenger racers as evidenced by the world titles he won in 2013 and 2015. Like Deportago-Cabrera, Horse has earned a sponsorship with Red Bull. Horse, who had won the previous two NACCC North American titles before this year, often finds himself at the starting line of an event surveying the competition, which allows him to better chart his own course. While he is known for speed, Horse ties much of his success to being a reliable messenger in his day-to-day life of working as one of the more than 5,000 couriers in New York. New York is known among bike messengers for its long avenues and abundance of green lights once cyclists master the rhythm of hitting lights in the right sequence. As opposed to Chicago, where streets aren't nearly as densely populated by traffic as in New York, Horse has learned to understand the best way to maneuver around the city in an effective manner. Yet, like the rest of the messenger community, instincts factor into street survival, especially in a city as unpredictable as New York. What that comes down to is , I think with humans, there's this sort of normal threshold of risk that you can operate with, Horse says. If you're below that threshold , then you're not satisfied 2013 you're not maximizing your human potential. As a people , we push what can be achieved and so there's risk in that. The more time you spend with certain risks, the more familiar you become with that edge and for someone who is very experienced with traffic, they can do something that would be very alarming to the lay person. But I know I am fully aware of the risks. I make no moves when I'm counting on someone else to react. I never do something where my safety is depending on the actions of another person and I think that this experienced messengers learn. Regardless of how many competitions he has won , Horse knows being a champion bike messenger racer doesn't carry much weight outside of his chosen community of cyclists. But he treats his daily work with the same level of dedication as he does any North American or world championship, knowing that's when his cycling abilities really matter. Among his proudest moments: Racing against the clock to secure the dentures of a man who had passed away and delivering them to a New York City hospital so that the man's family could remember him the way they had always seen him before his death. But in other lighter moments, Horse is happy to let his customers know of his racing success. When you're the world champion and you're delivering a package to someone , they'll be like, 'That was really fast' and then when someone says that, what do you do? Horse said. I'll be , 'Yeah, I'm the best in the world.' No matter the differences between the cities where messengers work , some rules still apply. After nine years on a job he never expected to last more than more than a few weeks, Deportago-Cabrera has long relied on his street smarts to get him from one side of Chicago to the other while splitting time working between two courier companies. Over the years, Deportago has blended well-known industry secrets with his instincts. He can predict when traffic is going to shift or when drivers are going to make a quick turn before they actually do, which allows Deportago-Cabrera to remain one step ahead and act accordingly. After making a tactical error in this year's NACCCC final Deportago-Cabrera estimates put him 15 minutes behind the competition and seemingly out of contention for a win, a split-second decision to make one last pick-up and delivery worth $4 as the final minutes of the race ticked away proved to be a difference-maker. Deportago-Cabrera, who also won the weekend's Out of Towner alley-cat race, ended up finishing $1 ahead of the second-place finisher and $2 ahead of third-place, giving him not only his second win of the weekend and the bragging rights that accompany a NACCC championship, but a title that will be linked to his name for the next year. For someone who grew up skateboarding and roller blading, but never enjoying much athletic success, Deportago-Cabrera has started to enjoy the benefits of being one of courier cycling's top competitors. He travels more than he ever did. He has competed in international locales such as Paris and Tokyo and become a mainstay in what he refers to this crazy world that he never knew existed before stumbling upon it a decade ago. And as much as he loves a day-to-day messenger lifestyle he assumed he would one day gave up in exchange for a real job , Deportago-Cabrera relishes the thought of being the best at what he does 2013 at least in North America and at least until someone comes along and takes his title. For Deportago-Cabrera , who also performs for Chicago-based punk rock bands Young Distractions and The Static Age, that is living. Dude , I wake up every day hyped because yeah, I'm f----- Nico and I'm the best bike messenger in North America, Deportago-Cabrera says , It's awesome. -- Email Jeff Arnold at jeff.arnold@thepostgame.com and follow him on Twitter @JeffArnold_.

Justin Lane EPA There is a record number of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender delegates at this year's Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. And while they come from a variety of different states and backgrounds, most seem to have at least two things in common: their support for the Equality Act and their contempt for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. LGBT delegates make up 11.5 percent of all delegates at the DNC this year, and this record number is not a coincidence - it's by design. In order to increase the number of delegates from underrepresented communities, veteran LGBT delegates established an advisory board to recruit new and qualified LGBT delegates from across the U.S. The newly appointed delegates span the LGBT spectrum and bring a variety of experience and fresh perspectives to the delegation. RELATED: Watch the 2016 Democratic National Convention Live Merrick Moses, a transgender delegate from Maryland, told NBC OUT he's excited to be a part of making history at the DNC, but he emphasized there is much more work to be done. I'd like [Hillary Clinton] to ensure that wherever LGBT people are in this country , they cannot be fired because of their gender identity or sexual orientation, he said. According to the National Center for Transgender Equality , more than one in four transgender people have lost a job due to bias, and more than three in four have experienced workplace discrimination. RELATED: LGBTQ Takeaways From the RNC Several delegates who spoke with NBC OUT, including DNC LGBT Caucus Chair Earl Fowlkes, said the best way to protect LGBT citizens is the passage of the Equality Act. This bill is currently in the House and Senate and would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to include discrimination protection based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Fowlkes, who was instrumental in increasing the percentage of LGBT delegates from 7.8 percent in 2012 to 11.5 percent this year, said he sees passage of the Equality Act as essential to protecting the millions of LGBT Americans who can get married today and get thrown out of their homes or fired from their job the next day. He called the bill the next big picture item on the list for LGBT equality and said it's necessary in order to end discrimination in all forms against LGBT people. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump delivers a speech at the Republican National Convention on July 21 , 2016 in Cleveland, Ohio. Alex Wong Getty Images In addition to their support of the Equality Act, LGBT delegates who spoke to NBC OUT were united in their contempt for Donald Trump. Disaster and horrible were just some of the words used to describe a potential Trump presidency. He is an erratic and dangerous man. His foreign policy would be unpredictable , and his domestic policy would certainly be a trainwreck, Chris Sgro , a DNC delegate and a member of the North Carolina General Assembly, said of the GOP presidential nominee. Sgro said the Republican platform is a step backward for America in the same way HB2, North Carolina's so-called bathroom bill , has been for his state. If the GOP had its way , the whole country would look like North Carolina, Sgro added. Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine attend a campaign rally in Miami , Florida on July 23, 2016. Gustavo Caballero Getty Images As might be expected, the LGBT DNC delegates who spoke with NBC OUT were supportive of their party's nominee, Hillary Clinton, and seemed confident she would continue the pro-LGBT policies of the Obama administration. I think Secretary Clinton is the one with the most experience , Merrick Moses said. She has a 40-year track record of working with marginalized communities around the nation and the world.

   "input": "BY GEORGE RUSH AND JOANNA MOLLOY Wednesday, September 27th 1995, 4:33AM Barbra Streisand once claimed, I never learned about manipulating men. But our early peek at James Spada's new bio , Streisand: Her Life (Crown) , suggests she was being much too modest. According to Spada: Her Yentl co-star Mandy Patinkin had to sign a clause in his contract agreeing never to say anything bad about Streisand. Ex-husband Elliott Gould once told her , I don't know why I'm loyal to you. You're not nice to me. You don't like me. You're mean to me. You don't help me. You're rude to me. Still , the diva wasn't always in control: Spada writes that Babs' boyfriend, haircutter-turned-producer Jon Peters, was quick to lose his temper and quick to resort to fisticuffs. A Star Is Born director Frank Pierson soon realized that Barbra was in physical fear of Jon. The writer adds: As Pierson walked to his car at the end of filming one evening , he saw Barbra scurry out from behind a hedge, crouched low, and running along behind some cars. 'For God's sake, take me home!' she pleaded. In the car, she cowered in a corner, trembling. 'He gets so furious, ' she said. 'I don't know what to do.' Streisand's relationship with Don Johnson began to unravel after she heard he was seeing Penelope Ann Miller on the sly during a film shoot in Canada. Streisand quickly flew North and the two rekindled their romance. But after Johnson started dating 18-year-old Uma Thurman , Johnson reportedly suggested they embark on a non-monagamous open marriage. Streisand didn't bite. Spada , who's written biographies of Bette Davis and Grace Kelly, also claims that Streisand went on her recent tour because of cash-flow problems. Spada said Streisand called music producer Barry Dennen in 1993 for financial advice, saying, all my money's tied up in investments and real estate.

Pamela Anderson Lee's long-time body double Melissa Park was fired Thursday after she told a national TV show that the only difference between her and the equally buxom star is that Lee used implants to achieve her camelback silhouette. The only real difference between me and Pam is they're real , Park vouched , pointing breastward. This startling revelation was aired on American Journal last Wednesday.. The next morning , Park was fired. Park, who's been Lee's stand-in for three years and her double in the movie Barb Wire , wrote Lee an apology in an attempt to get back her unique position. I thought we'd known each other long enough that we could joke about things and not take things so seriously , Park wrote. Alas , Park chose the two things Lee takes most seriously. Charlie Sheen has only been married a few weeks to former model Donna Peele. But does his ex-girlfriend have a surprising wedding present? Ex-porn star Ginger Lynn Allen is telling friends that she's pregnant. She's also saying Sheen could be the father, a West Coast source claims. Allen, the 32-year-old star of Bound and Gagged , gave up blue movies 10 years ago , and has since starred in legit pix like Young Guns , in which Sheen also starred. The two began dating in 1991 and have kept in touch. In 1993 , Sheen helped pay her back taxes. Allen's agent, Charles Clay, told us late yesterday: I don't know the answer and I have no comment.

Roberto Alaniz says he asked me to work with him. Carlton Brown , who's black, vouches, He was courteous to everybody and treated me well. Why then did Fuhrman spew such venom to screenwriter Laura McKinney? Brown guesses money made Fuhrman sensationalize his cop yarns.

Word is Robert Sam Anson , the hard-driving New York journalist who took over the mag last May, has been hit with several internal complaints by female staffers claiming he's referred to them by their body parts. Anson, who has cut out the mag's use of sexist expletives in its articles, says company policy forbids him from discussing staff complaints. He admits he did once get into an argument with managing editor Helene Goldsen. I don't believe I screamed , says Anson. I was not sexist. Anson allows , I can be short with people.

Sobs and prayers echoed through the Masonic Temple in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, where more than 600 friends and relatives bid a somber farewell. They were a beautiful family , said a tearful Idalia Bisbal ,42, a Crown Heights neighbor of James and Auber Stewart. They were so friendly , such very sweet people. Five open metal coffins , each surrounded by a bounty of flowers, sat at the front of the sprawling assembly hall. The first coffin held Zora Goins,75, who sang in the choir at Cornerstone Baptist Church in Brooklyn. Next to her was her nephew Melvin Stewart, 52. His parents, Auber Stewart,72, and James Stewart,75, a former Marine who survived D-Day, were beside him. Their daughter Lorraine,49, ended the solemn row. About 8 p.m., immediate family members, including James and Auber's sons, James Stewart Jr., the second-ranking member of the Jack Wilson Masonic Lodge, and Craig Stewart, an 18-year veteran of the NYPD, entered for the funeral service. Lorraine Stewart, an administrator for District 32 in Brooklyn, was driving her family home from a wake a week ago tonight when their minivan slammed into a city bus on Brooklyn Ave. at St. Johns Place in Crown Heights. Police believe Auber Stewart, who suffered from a heart condition, became ill and that Lorraine was racing to get her to Kings County Hospital when she ran a red light and hit the bus.

The United States is investigating Credit Suisse and 10 other Swiss banks on suspicions that they helped Americans evade taxes.

A new study headed by a pair of psychologists at Goldsmiths University of London and published in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters, found that Japanese baseball players with short, broad faces are more likely to be skilled than their long-faced colleagues. According to the Daily Mail, lead researchers Hikaru Tsujimura and Michael Banissy measured the facial width-to-height ratio of 104 baseball players in Japan 2019s professional league. Tsujimura and Banissy tracked those players for two seasons, and came to the conclusions that the players who hit the most home runs also had the highest facial width-to-height ratio. The logic behind this correlation could be that a wider jaw is a sign of higher testosterone levels. And increased testosterone is generally associated with more physical strength and agression. The researchers say this correlation may apply for people of all nationalities. In fact, a previous study on caucasian CEO's found that people with broader faces are more likely to run successful firms. This isn't the first study in which the shapes of players' faces correlate with their success.

   "input": "Tracey Emin, she of dirty sheets, cheap vodka, shagging, tents, bad teeth, bad behaviour, struts into the lobby of the 00a3500-a-night Hotel Costes in Paris, aka Fashion Central, in a divinely slinky caramel Yves Saint Laurent satin skirt and towering chocolate-brown Prada sandals. She has the best legs in the lobby, which, as anyone who has been to the Costes will tell you, is saying something. Her camisole, which is the palest caf 00e9-au-lait silk, reveals a glimpse of her mint- green Agent Provocateur bra and acres of nut-brown skin. She looks amazing. Wotcha. Miaow. How long is it going to take to get a fucking drink today? Mollified with a flute of ros 00e9 champagne , she settles herself into an overstuffed armchair. You look good , she greets one of her entourage , looking slightly huffy. Then she glances in a mirror, and brightens. Unfortunately , however, not as fucking good as me. Emin , who accompanied the Guardian to this week's couture shows, is a couture natural. She has pure front-row diva attitude in spades. For a start, she is the only person I have ever met who can out-attitude the staff at the Hotel Costes. You may be rude and beautiful, Emin tells them in no uncertain terms, but I'm more rude, more beautiful, and what's more, I'm paying, so jump to it, sharpish. She is here to deliver an artist's judgment on haute couture. Haute couture, the uppermost echelon of fashion, which deals in handmade dresses for 00a320,000 and up, is in crisis - hardly surprising, when you consider that you can buy decent knock-offs in Zara. When Donatella Versace pulls out, as she did this week, saying the event is over the top and unnecessary, you know you're in trouble. With the numbers not adding up, haute couture can only claim any raison d'etre on the basis of artistic merit. Emin has a unique viewpoint on this, being, in her words, one of the only artists who know anything about fashion - there's just me and Sam [Taylor-Wood]. Plus she has real experience in fashion: she began her art school training , aged 18, with a diploma in fashion craft, and has just designed a range of bags for Longchamp, with her trademark ransom-note lettering spelling out sentiments such as international loverand you said you love me. And she can sympathise with couturiers who are passionate about an art that most of the public see as a joke - as they do fashion and , as evidenced by the reaction to the Momart fire in east London, much modern art. It is Tuesday and Dior is our first stop. The catwalk is lit with strips of pink neon, so Emin feels immediately at home. She gets the hang of the never-too-much couture aesthetic remarkably quickly: by the time the lights go down, she is whispering to me that what would be good now would be some white Persian cats on the catwalk. The models are as elongated and fragile as porcelain figurines, but there is always something odd, something dark, going on, and Emin loves it. The huge duvet coats remind her of a performance by Leigh Bowery where he started out looking even bigger than usual, and then appeared to give birth to his wife from under his clothes. She loves the white ballgown with lapping petals of silk blossoming from the mound of Venus (Emin's phrase) - very Georgia O'Keeffe. She doesn't like the fur , however (she is missing her cat, Docket, already). Maybe it's secondhand , though, she suggests , rather sweetly. I haven't the heart to point out that since Galliano has a 20ac3m ( 00a32m) budget at his disposal this seems unlikely. After the show she is pumped full of energy, even more livewire than usual. It makes you feel like you dress really lazily , doesn't it? It's made me want to go to my studio and create something. That's a big compliment. But isn't it all a bit over the top? You have to go to an extreme because that's the way to find something new. So is it art? Yes , she says, because you can tell that Galliano is an artist. Being an artist is as much about what you can see in the world around you as what you create. I look outside now [we are driving through Paris in dappled sunlight] and I can see how truly beautiful the light is. That's what makes me an artist. That evening at Valentino is a different ballgame , ultra-feminine, ultra-glamorous. Emin loves the stage set: the models emerge through a tall silver-bead curtain and the whole scene is reflected in a giant mirror so that, if you watch the reflection, the models seem to be walking upwards towards the bright-lit heaven of the photographers' flashbulbs. She admires a jade-green skirt suit, but thinks the fur jackets look like orang-utans, and she doesn't like lace, which is a problem at Valentino. She is clearly desperately trying to think of nice things to say, because she met Valentino once and thought he was lovely. He always makes bottoms look good, she says. Afterwards she says, I think I'm too young to wear Valentino. We go backstage so she can kiss him anyway. Very fashion. Emin is in her element at couture. She loves the craziness of it , the fact that it makes no financial sense and yet everyone behaves as if it is fabulously important. And she has the temperament to appreciate the idea of couture, of so much time and effort going into making one woman look beautiful - she is, after all (and she said this, not me), very narcissistic. It will come as a surprise to those who think of her as snaggle-toothed Margate Emin that she is absolutely at home in the fashion social scene. At Dior, she turns out to be on matey terms with the entire front row. Liz Hurley greets her like an old friend (they met through Elton John) and invites her to her party at the Ritz that night. Val Kilmer reminisces with her about drunken escapades in hotel rooms (they met through Ronnie Wood, after all.) This, I suddenly remember, is a girl who spent her first proper pay cheque on a platter of oysters. Later that night, I leave her on the dancefloor at Hurley's party (there were male models wearing thongs with lace-up shoes and socks. Thongs with brogues is a fashion faux pas too far for me at the end of a long day's work.) Write that you left me dancing on the dancefloors of Paris , she says. In the morning , I ask her what she meant and she tells me a story. When serving in France, her uncle Alan sent his mother a postcard which said, Next time you see me I'll be dancing on the dancefloors of Paris. The next time she heard from him was the notification of his death. So I was saying that for my uncle , she explains. I tell her it sounds like something from a Tracey Emin piece. The Next Time You See Me ... Emin's storytelling gene comes through in the way she dresses. She describes her current style as very Mediterranean , Sophia Loren in the 1970s, Jean-Luc Godard on holiday in Italy, Jackie Onassis if she only would have relaxed a bit. And consider , if you will, her scent: she wears Agent Provocateur perfume (because they are my friends) , Dior Eau Svelte and the lemony, masculine Eau Savage by Christian Dior. Svelte, Savage and Provocateur: it is an unmistakably Emin combination, even without smelling it. And then there's her jewellery. Around her neck she wears two gold necklaces, both from her brother. One, which he gave her when she graduated with a first-class degree, is strung with two gold rings - her nan's 1916 wedding ring and another, which Emin hopes will one day be her daughter's ring. The other, her brother and his wife gave her when she won the Turner prize. On her wrist she wears black sea pearls (the orphan pearls that get left behind , as she puts it) and two gold bangles. She bought these in Istanbul to replace two bangles that Matt , her ex-boyfriend, had given her, after they broke up. Because, as she explains to me, complete with an enthusiastic mime, It wouldn't be right to be giving someone a handjob wearing bangles another man had given you. In her own way , Emin is a true romantic. Whatever she wears, I put it to her, trying to be polite, there is a bra thing going on. There's a breast thing going on , you mean, she corrects me. She loves underwear: no outfit is complete without a sensational shot of chartreuse lace or pink satin. And she is proud of her body , which is very slim and very busty. I like being thin. To the point where I'd be anorexic to be thin if I had to be. She is known for wearing a lot of Vivienne Westwood's clothes: the two met when Mario Testino took their portraits for Vogue , and Westwood has been making clothes for Emin ever since. (The clothes are made to fit, giving her a rare insight into the life of a couture client.) She wears Westwood because it suits her figure, she says, but clearly also adores the designer, referring to her constantly throughout the week. She never wears high-street clothes. She loves Diane von Furstenberg dresses, and Helmut Lang jeans, and Yves Saint Laurent tailoring. But she can't wear Jean Paul Gaultier, she explains as we are waiting on Thursday for his show to start, because I'm too sexy. It's too much , with my body. I've got it already. Soon , Gaultier is over. We head backstage with Liz, who pronounces the show absolutely glorious , sounding exactly like a Roedean head girl who is jolly pleased that the weather has turned out well for sports day. Emin, on the other hand, seems slightly underwhelmed by her fellow enfant terrible. I'd wear the capes and tunics if I was pregnant , she says , which one might think was a back-handed compliment, except that Emin doesn't do back-handed anything. And I love the music , and the girl with the red hair, who looked like Puss in Boots. She shrugs. It was good , yeah. I just wish there was more champagne.  ",

   "input": "In person, Taryn Simon seems like an unlikely contender for the title of most important photographer of her generation. Dressed in brown woolly tights and a matching check dress that looks thrift shop but is probably designer-Amish, she appears to have stepped out of a Sofia Coppola adaptation of an Edith Wharton novel. She is charming and personable but becomes palpably nervous when talking about her work, which is characterised by its complexity and ambition. I do seem to try to make things harder and harder for myself , she says , laughing. In some perverse way , obstacles interest me and I'm drawn to projects that end up being incredibly laborious. This week , an exhibition of new work entitled A Living Man Declared Dead and Other Chapters opens at Tate Modern, a rare accolade for a photographer who is just 36 years old. It is an investigation into the nature of genealogy and its consequences and is her most complex, ambitious and laborious project yet. It comprises a series of 18 family bloodlines, each with a strange or arresting individual story at its heart: an Iraqi man who was apparently employed as Saddam Hussein's son's body double; a member of the Druze religious sect in Lebanon who believes in reincarnation and re-enacts remembered scenes from previous lives; a living Indian man who gives the project its title, having been declared dead in official records. It is a complex and multilayered exhibition , but also direct and engaging, says Simon Baker , Tate Modern's curator of photography. There are a small number of photographers who combine the visual and the textual so powerfully , and whose work is sophisticated in terms of contemporary art practice but also hard-wired to the real world. Taryn is certainly one of them. In one way, walking into the exhibition is like entering an incredible book. Simon is currently one of the hottest properties on the international art photography market. Her prints fetch stellar prices at auction and have been acquired by leading institutions such as the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney in New York , the Getty Museum in Los Angeles and the Pompidou Centre in Paris, as well as the Victoria and Albert Museum and Tate Modern in London. She is represented by Larry Gagosian, the gallery owner and art dealer who also represents Damien Hirst in New York and oversees the estate of Andy Warhol. A Living Man Declared Dead is on loan to Tate Modern from Jane and Michael Wilson, a couple who are perhaps the most important collectors of photography in Britain. (Michael Wilson, who made his fortune co-producing James Bond films with his sister, Barbara Broccoli, was recently described in the FT as a one-man Photography Council.) Socially , too, Simon is well connected. She lives in downtown Manhattan with her husband, Jake Paltrow, a film-maker who recently directed his older sister, Gwyneth, in his debut feature, The Good Night. In an article about their purchase of a $2m apartment in the Village, the New York Observer dubbed them a dandy 30-ish power couple. When I mentioned her to a New York-based photographer last week , he said, with a perhaps understandable mixture of bemusement and envy, How many photographers have Steven Spielberg come to an opening? For all that , Simon is undoubtedly a serious and committed artist whose work is unapologetically cerebral. She is meticulous, perhaps even obsessive, in her preparation and research. A Living Man Declared Dead took four years to come to fruition, but only about two months of that time was spent photographing the subjects. The majority of my work is about preparation , she says during a break from overseeing the installation of her show at Tate Modern. The act of taking photographs is actually a very small part of the process. I work with a small team , just my sister (Shannon Simon) and one assistant (Douglas Emery). We deal with translators, fixers, fact checkers and the logistics of setting up shoots in places where people do not have the internet or access to telephones. Then there was the actual bloodlines which had to be constructed and verified. She sighs and shakes her head. It is easily the most difficult and demanding project I have done thus far. She made her name with An American Index of the Hidden and Unfamiliar , published in 2007, a book that delves deep into a secret America in images that are often both detached and ominous: a nuclear waste storage facility in Washington State; a cryopreservation unit where bodies are frozen just after death; a bio-containment laboratory where deadly animal diseases are studied; a death row outdoor recreational cage; a cave where a sleeping black bear and its cubs are monitored by biologists studying hibernation. Like an Annie Leibovitz of the conceptual world, Simon seems to possess considerable clout when it comes to both access and control. Her mixture of tenacity and charm seems to have worked wonders on organisations not known for their openness: the Church of Scientology, the Ku Klux Klan and the Prisoner of War Interrogation Resistance Programme run by Team Delta, a private body run by former US military personnel. (Ironically, one of the few organisations that denied her access was Disney, whose spokesperson sent her a fax that read: Especially during these violent times , I personally believe that the magical spell cast on guests that visit our theme parks is particularly important to protect, and helps to provide them with an important fantasy they can escape to. It was , she told Interview Magazine, better that any photograph I could have ever produced.) An American Index of the Hidden and Unfamiliar is one of those rare photography books that struck a chord with both photography buffs and the wider public. In his introduction , Salman Rushdie pinpointed why: In a historical period in which many people are making such great efforts to conceal the truth from the mass of the people , an artist like Taryn Simon is an invaluable counter-force. Democracy needs visibility, accountability, light 2026 Somehow, Simon has persuaded a good few denizens of hidden worlds not to scurry for shelter when the light is switched on, as cockroaches and vampires do, but to pose proudly for her invading lens 2026 Simon grew up in New York and started taking pictures as a child. Both my father and grandfather were avid photographers. I was introduced to the larger world and photographic production through their slideshows. I would often go on little expeditions with them , taking photographs in a very loose form. Her father worked for the government , often travelling to dangerous and distant places and returning with an enormous number of photographs. Her grandfather lived in Connecticut , where he ground glass for telescopes and, as she put it, was more interested in the macro 2013 stars , insects, and plant and animal life. He also built telescopes , which may help explain the scientific undertow in her current work: the interest in genetic mapping and patterning, the portraits that are presented in systematic grids, complete with footnotes and ancillary information. Photography, then, is in her blood, though she studied environmental science at college, obtaining a BA at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. I just kept on taking photographs throughout my time there , and afterwards I worked as an assistant for photographers involved in various approaches 2013 anything from a journalist to a toy catalogue photographer. Anything, really, just to learn about lighting and composition and the whole technical side of photography. After starting out on her own , she did some editorial work for the New York Times magazine before successfully applying for a Guggenheim grant for a tentative work-in-progress that eventually became her first book, The Innocents. Published to considerable acclaim in 2003, it set the tone in both its scope and ambition for much of what was to follow. In large format portraits and extended texts, The Innocents documents American victims of miscarriages of justice, various men 2013 and just one woman 2013 who have served time for violent crimes they did not commit. Its subtext is photography's role, even complicity, in the wrongful convictions, most of which were often obtained through the police's use of photographs, Polaroids and mugshots of the accused in witness corroboration. The Innocents is very much about the use and misuse of photography , says Simon. I would often take the subjects back to the scene of the crime , a scene that they had never before been to, but were forever linked to. The place that had changed their lives forever. Like some of the chapters in A Living Man Declared Dead, The Innocents is about people suddenly caught up in a narrative that is not their own. Until she undertook A Living Man Declared Dead , Simon's work was, as she puts it, about issues of power , mainly American power, at a historical moment when governance and power structures are destabilising and changing due to unpredictable forces like the global economy, environmental changes and asymmetrical warfare. For all that , though, she rejects the label political artist and its connotations. The work eludes that kind of categorisation intentionally , though, of course, it may activate something political in the viewer or resonate with them in a political way. But I don't have an agenda. I guess a lot of what I do is underpinned by anxiety. But I am also anxious about photography and its role. I try to keep a clear distance from the subject. I never want to say that I understand or somehow know the subject. In fact, it's more that I don't know. Last year , Simon published Contraband, a book of relatively humble ambition, for which she spent four days without sleep at the US Customs and Border Protection site and the US Postal Service international mail facility at JFK airport in New York. The book is another visual inventory, this time of 1,075 seized items, some bizarre (deer penis, cow dung toothpaste, a dead bird), some mundane (sausages, spices, pumpkins). People imagine customs officers seizing familiar threats 2013 drugs or weapons 2013 but most of the seized items were , of themselves, incredibly mundane. I was fascinated by the idea that a banal thing like a banana or an apple could suddenly assume a threatening identity because it is in the contraband room. In both her creative ambition and conceptual reach , Simon is at the vanguard of a relatively new kind of photography that evades easy categorisation and often blurs the boundaries between reportage, conceptualism and portraiture. Alongside the likes of Jim Goldberg, winner of this year's Deutsche B 00f6rse prize, and Paul Graham, whose work is currently on show at the Whitechapel Gallery, she makes work that straddles the worlds of documentary photography and fine art. A Living Man Declared Dead is a really important work because it draws on various often exclusive traditions , says Simon Baker. It has the tenacity we associate with photojournalism and the practices and presentation of art photography. In a way , it's bringing the real world 2013 politics in the broadest sense 2013 into galleries and museums. That is not an easy thing to do, but photography can do it very well and this particular show is an amazing example of a complex and ambitious project that contains within its presentation all the things you need to understand about it. That may well be so , but I also suspect that, for the casual or curious viewer, it may prove a demanding, even frustrating, experience, not least because the ambition and complexity of the idea almost overwhelms the actual work on the walls 2013 a dilemma that is at the heart of much high-end conceptual art. In one way, too, Simon's work also refutes the long held notion that a great photograph should speak for itself, much of its impact resting on the interrelation of image and text, the latter giving the former much of its power and resonance. With A Living Man Declared Dead, she has arrived at a place where, visually, all extraneous style and embellishment, even context, has been discarded. The portraits that make up each individual bloodline are arranged in grids and are unadorned and undramatic. They have a certain cumulative power but certainly do not possess the intrigue or the mystery of the images in An American Index of the Hidden and Unfamiliar. This, it turns out, is intentional. I think I've just gotten tired of photography in a way , she says , revealingly, at one point, and am trying to use it as a simple recorder allowing the construction of collections and associations that disturb the value of the single image and underscore issues of translation. Certainly the progression of my work has very much been a shedding of style and embellishment. The neutral background of the non-place behind many of my subjects corresponds to this erasure. The neutral portraits of individual bloodlines , arranged in scientific grids against white backgrounds, and hung in a huge gallery space where, at Simon's insistence, the walls are ultra-white and the lighting ultra-bright, are punctuated by blank spaces that represent the missing, the dead or those who refused to have their photograph taken. This is a project, then, as these absences attest, about the limits of photography 2013 a strange place for a young photographer to end up. It will be interesting to see where she goes next. A Living Man Declared Dead and Other Chapters is at Tate Modern, London, 25 May to 6 September. An accompanying book of the work is published by MACK , at 00a380  ",

Tonight, an hour every parent wants to see. Every parent these stories, thinking not my child. With all of that alcohol, he was uniquing into the wrong house and what happened next, only two people will ever know for sure. And one of them is dead. Here's abc's deborah roberts. Reporter: It was a late saturday night last spring. 16-year-old caleb gordley had a secret plan, to sneak out of his house to go party with some friends. A popular, three-sport athlete at parkview high school in virginia, caleb was also an aspiring rapper seeing himself as the next jay-z. &#9834; &#9834; time moves slow &#9834; he was a self-proclaimed rapper, going by the name of prince george. The core was his music , was his lyrics, was his -- poetry. I have 85 songs that I've collected. Reporter: A good kid? Great kid. He was very respectful, very polite. Reporter: Partier? No. He did not drink. And that's what makes that night even more peculiar, even more odd. Reporter: And out of character for caleb. He's not much of a drinker, but, I guess, he wanted to try for that night. Reporter: Yet, the one-time caleb decided to let loose. He would wind up dead in a stranger's home. It all began with a typical teen punishment. He had been grounded because he went to the park on a sunday afternoon after I told him to clean his room. I said, one week , you cannot go anywhere. You go to school. You go to practice, whatever. You're coming straight home. And he accepted it. He doesn't get up in my face. He said, all right , dad. Reporter: By the end of the week , caleb is itching to get out of the house. &#9834; Reporter: Tweeting throughout the day, honestly , who's throwing a party tonight. I'm trying to have fun tonight, no lie. Caleb and sister eden are living with their dad , their parents shawn and jennea are divorced. Their first born was a natural ham, caleb, here at 6, busting a move to 'n sync's song girlfriend. &#9834; he just had that energy that really attracted lot of people to him. Because he was so fun and good-hearted. Reporter: To give their kids a better life , the gordleys left behind the tough, crime-ridden streets of dayton, ohio, for the tranquil suburbs of sterling, virginia, where shawn is a corporate i.T. Manager. I was happy with the area, i was happy with the school. The community seemed to be very active and social and kind of close-knit. Reporter: After the split, jennae moved back to ohio to go to school, but never missed a beat with her kids. How much did you monitor his social media accounts? A lot. And that was the one time i didn't in that particular day. I would have saw the signs if i would have just looked that day. About the parties and talking to friends about it. He was looking for someplace to go that night. Reporter: So, at the stroke of midnight, caleb slips out the window of his two-story home. He would never return. Caleb's first mistake would happen just after arriving at a buddy's house a few blocks away. Some of the boys begin tossing back vodka shots. By 2:00 a.M., A woozy caleb decides it's time to go home before his dad notices he's gone. Good friend kory carico was with caleb. I took him back to my house and I was going to make him stay there, but he knew he had to get home. I knew that for sure. He kept bothering us about it, Reporter: Staggering now, caleb needs his sober friend to walk him the few blocks home to his quiet cul-de-sac where many of the houses in the development look nearly identical. We crossed this fence because all the houses are similar, and once we crossed we came up to this window over here. You thought this was the window? Yes. We thought this was the window, I've never come in the back way before. It looks different from the back. I always come from the front when I come pick him up in the morning, so I figured it was his house because he thought it was his house, too. Reporter: Did you just sort of like shove caleb in? No, he went in himself. The alarm went off and then i saw the light come on and then i heard yelling, which I thought was his dad, so then I ran because I thought I was going to get in trouble. Reporter: Turns out it's not caleb's dad, in fact it's not even caleb's house. It's the neighbor's home two doors down. The startled homeowner grabs his 40-caliber pistol that he kept next to his bed thinking a burglar has broken in at 2:30 in the morning. In the chilling moments that follow -- gunshots. How many times was caleb actually physically shot? Once. Out of four shots, he was hit once. A developing story now out of sterling. Responded to burglary. Reporter: The next morning news of a shooting quickly spreads through the neighborhood. At caleb's home, there is panic. His sister eden realizes her brother isn't in his bed. Many friend's mother called her and told her that someone two doors away from us had gotten shot. She said somebody was trying to break in. I told my dad and then maybe like an hour later, he was like, i woke up this morning and caleb's not home. I don't know where he is. I ran over to the neighbors' house , knocked on the door and didn't find out any information. Reporter: What's going through your mind at this point? I know my son's dead. I know he's dead. Cory dropped caleb off at my house at 2:30 in the morning, and there was a shooting in my neighborhood at 2:30 and I can't find my son. I knew it instantly. Reporter: His 16-year-old son shot dead. I could barely talk. And I was so lost. I couldn't fathom surviving this. I just -- no. I was like, what -- there's no -- no -- there's no going beyond this. Reporter: Eden and shawn break the unbearable news to jennea in ohio. Overcome with grief , she heads to virginia. I wept in the airport, I wept on the plane in front of strangers, and it didn't even matter. Reporter: You lost your son. Did you understand at all what had happened? I did. I understood that, you know, he made a mistake. And it cost him his life. Yeah, my handsome man. Reporter: A life even caleb realized was fragile. This is a new microphone. Trust me, I'm going to have six songs I'm going to put out today. Sfwlr and one of those songs he wrote just months before dying is oddly prophetic. &#9834; Reporter: Called wreckless , the sound of gunshots in the background , caleb. &#9834; Your life can be done like that like that, like that &#9834; Reporter: His own life cut heartbreakingly short in what seemed a classic case of self-defense. This person going up the stairs, I guess he felt in fear for their lives. I mean, I put all on me at first. I thought it was all my fault, because I took him to the wrong house. Reporter: But then you realized it was a tragic mistake. Yeah. Reporter: Both shawn and jennea believed it an awful accident, until they got the police report. What it revealed would change everything for caleb's parents. Once I got the details, I was absolutely outraged. Reporter: Was it self-defense or something else? Murder. Reporter: Stay with us.

Free for iOS, Android, Windows 8,and Kindle Fire devices An impressive start is comiXology 2019s Comics app. It is free for iOS, Android, Windows 8, and Kindle Fire devices, although you have to sign up for an account with the company. It works as you might expect. Part of the interface is dedicated to helping users find, buy, and download comic books from a digital store, and part is a clever comic book e-reader. The discovery section is well organized: It lets you search for comics, offers different story categories to browse through, and lists popular and free options. A handy section called 201cNew to comics? Start here 201d has a list of titles that may pique your interest. Free comics are available as samplers, and an issue typically costs around $2. A huge range of publishers offer content, including big names like DC and Marvel, as well as smaller publishing houses. The neat part of Comics is its reader. Unlike a traditional e-reader, which simply lets you flip through and read the pages of a digital book, Comics allows interactivity with each story 2019s panels. Tapping on the edge of the screen or swiping across it to 201cturn the page 201d makes the display sweep from one panel to the next with an attractive set of animations. This draws attention to every panel in the comic, because it zooms to fill the screen. I 2019ve long liked this effect, called Guided View, because it makes reading a digital comic dramatic. But some users may prefer using the standard swipe and pinch-to-zoom gestures to read the comic as if it were a simple image of a comic book page. There 2019s little to dislike about this app, although it doesn 2019t cover every comic publisher. Free on Android and iOS Dark Horse Comics, for example, is home to famous titles like 201cStar Wars. 201d The company has its own app, similar in design to Comics: It combines a comic book store and e-reader. I prefer the design of Dark Horse Comics 2019 store, because it 2019s more straightforward to scan through and easier on the eye. Like comiXology 2019s app, this also animates the process of reading the story panels. But its zooming effect can be a little jerky, and it sometimes seems as if the illustration quality drops during the zoom. It 2019s a small annoyance but noticeable. Of course, you can skip the animations and zoom into the panels yourself to read the story, too. Dark Horse 2019s app is free for Android and iOS, but digital comics inside its store can cost you a few dollars each. Free on iOS and Android I couldn 2019t write about comics without mentioning Japanese manga, and there are many apps out there for this genre. Manga Rock, free on iOS and Android, beats the competition. It has a list of more than 50,000 comics available, and although its reading system isn 2019t as sophisticated as the one in Comics, it is still smooth to use. It 2019s free, but to get access to all the comics you have to pay $4 for the full edition through an in-app upgrade. Manga Reader 2014 also free on Android 2014 may be a good alternative to Manga Rock. Manga Storm, free on iOS, is also worth checking out. Many comic anthologies are available as traditional e-books, and Amazon 2019s Kindle app (free on iOS, Android, and Windows) is one of the best and best known for reading this sort of publication. But you don 2019t get the dynamic reading effect.  ",

   "input": "Modernist and poet 2026 from 'Chicago - A Camera Exploration', Fortune, February 1947. Photograph: Walker Evans Metropolitan Museum of Art On 5 July,1963, Life magazine published a nine-page photo essay by Walker Evans titled America's Heritage of Great Architecture is Doomed 2026 It Must be Saved. It showed images of beautiful, historically important buildings threatened with demolition as a brutal wave of urban regeneration swept through the US. Chief among them was Pennsylvania station, Manhattan, a beaux-arts masterpiece from 1910that was scheduled to make way for a more functional, but faceless construction. The demolition of Penn station went ahead, but Evans's photographic essay made its mark, prompting a protest outside the terminus by 150 architects and critics 2013 and leading to a slew of similar photo-essays on endangered buildings in other US periodicals. Evans's photographs were being seen in the nation's most widely read magazine , writes David Campany in an exhaustive essay for Walker Evans: the Magazine Work. For the first and last time , he was in tune with popular feeling. Evans was 59 when the series was published. Two years later , he stopped working for magazines to teach graphic design at Yale University. Since then, he's become one of the towering figures of photography. A master of self-reinvention, Evans photographed depression-era America for the Farm Security Administration. In 1938, Walker Evans: American Photographs was held at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the first time the institution had hosted an exhibition of a single photographer's work. In 1941, he published his first book, the great Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, in which his quietly powerful images were set alongside emotive prose by journalist James Agee. The book of the same name remains one of the cornerstones of documentary photography in the 20th century. Evans is acclaimed, too, as a pioneering photographer of the America vernacular landscape 2013 street signs, highways, shop fronts, civic buildings and crossroads. Evans has been lauded for every part of his creative career except for his magazine work. From the mid-1920s to the early 1960s, Evans worked on assignment for Harper's Bazaar, Vogue, Vanity Fair, Life and Fortune magazine, for which he worked regularly for 20 years. Evans had unique artistic authority over his output. In small avant-garde publications and mainstream titles , Campany writes , he produced innovative and independent journalism 2013 often setting his own assignments , editing, writing and designing his pages. Thanks to this degree of control , not to mention the quiet power of his photographs, Walker Evans: the Magazine Years is an illuminating book, both for photography buffs and anyone interested in the history of magazine design. A photo-series such as Along the Right-of-Way, published in the September 1950 issue of Fortune, is pure Evans: urban landscapes 2013 factories, shacks, municipal buildings, houses 2013 taken from passing trains as they trundled across New Jersey and Connecticut, in Chicago, Pittsburgh and on through the citadels of steel production of Pennsylvania. Evans also wrote the captions and accompanying essay , revealing his first love: writing. In 1955, he created Beauties of the Common Tool, in which single-page images of everyday tools 2013 pliers, tin-snips, a crate opener, a trowel and a spanner 2013 are shot in stark black and white. Occasionally, his artistic assignments for magazines are previewed in edited form. A small section of his haunting and clandestine subway portraits of commuters, collected in the 1966 book Many Are Called, were first featured alongside Agee's text in the Cambridge Review in the winter of 1956. . Evans chose magazine stories that often had elegiac qualities: The American Warehouse (Architecture Forum, April 1962) pictures those vast buildings in decline, while The Auto-Junkyard (Fortune, April 1962) shows the scrapyards where outdated American cars went to die. The muted tones of his colour photographs add to the sense of transience, the feeling of things lost. In this, too, the magazine pictures echo his other, more well-known work. Walker Evans was a modernist and a poet of the United States' ever-changing, yet somehow secure, sense of itself. His work for magazines adds another layer of understanding in terms of how an already great artist saw the world. It also attests to the tenacity of his vision and the artistic control he fought hard for in his years as a magazine photographer. What he was fighting for, as Campany notes, was his commitment to the ideal of an intelligent and reflective pop culture. Though Evans won his own battle , that commitment remains a struggle worth fighting for. 2022 Walker Evans: the Magazine Work is published by Steidl  ",

The sale is part of a broader strategy to become a more digitally focused media outlet. The transaction is expected to close in a few weeks and net proceeds, including a tax benefit, are expected to be $150 million. The Boston Globe and the Telegram & Gazette of Worcester were not part of the sale. Founded in 2010, Halifax owns the Daytona Beach News-Journal and is headquartered in that Florida city.

   "input": "TEMPE, Ariz. -- D.J. Foster expected to finish in the end zone each time he touched the ball in Arizona State's season-opening win over Weber State. That's just how I think , Foster said. I expect a touchdown every time I touch the ball. Foster scored on two of his first 15 touches against Weber State , reaching the end zone on short runs from a few yards out. But it was his 19th touch -- a career-best 57-yard touchdown run -- that showed what the junior offers the Sun Devils' offense. I was just being patient and I finally got a chance to make a move and I just tried to make something out of it , Foster explained. As Foster takes on a role of featured back for the first time at ASU , his ability to change games on one play gives the high-powered offense a dynamic it lacked the past two seasons, and his versatility makes the ASU offense perhaps more dangerous than ever. Not that Marion Grice, ASU's primary back the past two years, wasn't capable of big, game-changing plays. Foster just seems to have a different gear that distinguishes him from Grice. Just really different backs , coach Todd Graham said. D.J. is a home run hitter. You saw the one (against Weber State). Any time he breaks , he gets past, he's going to go to the house. Added offensive coordinator Mike Norvell: Marion was a great back , but D.J. is different. I think you see the explosiveness he has. Any time he touches the ball he can go to the end zone. Christian Petersen-Getty Images North America ASU vs. NEW MEXICO When: 4 p.m. Saturday Where: University Stadium , Albuquerque, N.M. TV: CBS Sports Network (Carter Blackburn, Aaron Taylor) Radio: KTAR 92.3 FM (Tim Healey, Jeff Van Raaphorst) There is no disagreement: Put the ball in Foster's hands and there's a good chance he'll get you six points. ASU's last four games to support the notion. Foster stepped in as the No. 1 back for ASU's final three games last season after Grice was injured. From then to now, Foster has three games of at least 100 rushing yards and an average of 116.3 yards per game. He has seven rushing touchdowns and one receiving touchdown in that stretch. In ASU's 45-14 win over Weber State, Foster rushed for a career-high 147 yards and three touchdowns. He's on a good streak right now , Norvell said. He knows he's the guy. That's something where you see that confidence. When he's on the field , there's no big eyes. He's been there, he's done it, and he's had a lot of great success doing it. Foster downplays the idea that knowing he's the guy makes him run more confidently. He insists his motivation is making the most of the time he has left at ASU and being part of a winning program. But Foster surely knows the individual potential he possesses. It's what got him to this point. Interestingly , the path he has taken at ASU has mirrored the one he took at Scottsdale Saguaro High School. In his first two years at Saguaro, Foster played receiver and quarterback as he gained size. Then when the starting running back got hurt, he stepped in. The rest was history from there , Foster said. It's crazy how it's really the same story. I'm trying to just stay on the same path and keep working hard. In his first two seasons at ASU , Foster was more of a receiver, typically starting in the slot. In the two seasons combined, he caught 101 passes for 1,186 yards and eight touchdowns while rushing 195 times for 994 yards and eight touchdowns. Now 15-20 pounds heavier than when he arrived at ASU, Foster again takes on the role of lead back. He believes his style now is more physical than when he was a freshman, which sometimes makes Graham uneasy. He likes running over people instead of running around 'em , Graham said. Sometimes I'd like him to just run around 'em. But I like his mindset. He's my kind of tailback. He is an intense competitor , and I like that about him. Foster admits he likes running opponents over and sometimes lets his instincts take over in those moments but also says he's gotten smarter since taking on the No. 1 job , finding the right mix of physicality and finesse. When it's time to go and be physical , I know, Foster said. When it's time to just kind of not take the unnecessary hits , I know. I understand now that being in that main position I've got to take care of my body as much as I can. Foster's new role as the lead back doesn't mean , though, that he's done being a receiver. He had four catches against Weber State, and Norvell says the balance going forward will typically depend on what defenses show. He'll feel good about the offense if Foster is getting 20-30 touches per game regardless of how they're split. And as much as ASU likes Foster as a running back, his ability as a receiver is too great to take away from the offense. As a receiver he's a real challenge to deal with out of the backfield , Graham said. I think he's much harder to handle probably than what Marion was out of the backfield. Marion's strength was his counter running and his perimeter running. I think D.J. can do it all -- inside , outside. Grice , too, made plenty of big plays as a receiver, but Norvell points again to Foster's explosiveness as the difference between the backs. He just has so much versatility in what he can do and just his explosiveness makes him so dangerous , Norvell said. Graham has expressed belief that Foster could rush for more than 1 ,000 yards this season while also racking up 1, 000 receiving yards. Foster says he doesn't think about specific statistical goals -- I just really want to score every time I touch the ball , he says -- but enjoys those expectations. Norvell doesn't set stat-based expectations for Foster either. He's plenty content to just watch his top playmaker take the ball and make something happen. I don't put any limitations on him and what he can do , Norvell said. It's just making the most of every opportunity to get the ball in his hands and do what he does. I know those explosive plays are going to come. I don't have a set number in my mind of what I want him to do , but if he stays on track doing what he did the other night I think we'll be in good shape. Follow Tyler Lockman on Twitter  ",

   "input": "The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Saturday April 28 2007 Warrington is less than 20 miles from Manchester, rather than 50 as stated in the article below. This has been corrected. Ten years after Pete Postlethwaite's film career took off, an incident in an airport persuaded him that it was time to come back down to earth. I checked in believing myself to be in New York , but when I looked up at the boards I realised I was in LA, he says. Then my phone rang , and it was my agent wanting to know why I wasn't in San Francisco. Postlethwaite still makes the occasional film when he feels like it , but these days he prefers to play the role of a gentleman orchard farmer at his home in the Shropshire hills. And now he has returned to what he considers to be his natural environment, sitting in the bar of a repertory theatre with three pints of Guinness lined up in front of him, reflecting on a career that has turned full circle. Postlethwaite has come to Manchester Royal Exchange, barely 20 miles from his birthplace in Warrington, to rehearse Prospero in The Tempest. It seems to have put him in a valedictory frame of mind. It's all about endings , isn't it? Postlethwaite reflects , lighting the first of many cigarettes. I don't think Prospero is some kind of all-powerful magus. He's more of a tired old man aware of his mortality. He can be forgiven for having slightly morbid thoughts. Last year , he was devastated when his brother died unexpectedly: He was just a year older than me - worked all his life as a builder in Warrington , and had just begun to think about easing off a little. The week before he died, he complained about a twinge in his chest. I asked him if he was going to get it checked out, and he said, 'No - I'm not going to spend the rest of my life worrying about death.' Postlethwaite broke off filming Closing the Ring , a second-world-war drama being shot in Ireland by Richard Attenborough, to attend the funeral. He says that delivering the eulogy was the toughest performance of his life. It was around this time that the offer of The Tempest came in. I put it off for months before I realised that I ought to do it as a tribute to my brother. He was a kind of Prospero himself - incredibly wise and charismatic with a hard-won perception of the world. An elderly gentleman who has been listening in on the conversation shuffles up and nods at the mounting pile of stubs on the table. It'll kill you , that, he says. Why , how old do you think I am? Postlethwaite responds. Well , I'm in my 90s, the man replies , and I reckon you're about 72. Bloody hell , says Postlethwaite , who is in fact 62. To think I originally trained as a PE teacher. I ask if he still follows any kind of exercise routine. Yes , he responds dryly. Every morning , one eyelid goes up and the other immediately follows. His lugubrious air and distinctive features - angular and chiselled , as if by a cubist sculptor - have always created the impression that he may be older than his years. Following a brief career teaching at a girls' school in Manchester, Postlethwaite enrolled as a student at the Bristol Old Vic at the relatively advanced age of 24. I stood out like a sore thumb among all these fresh-faced teenagers , he says. I've been playing old men since I was a kid. To pay his fees , Postlethwaite worked nightshifts pressing beer kegs in a sheet metal plant in Bristol, a curious turn of fate as his father had trained as a cooper. Despite his efforts, he still found himself a few hundred pounds short of completing the course. The head of the school took me aside and said , 'Listen, I have a hunch you're going to do all right in this business, so I'm going to put down the outstanding amount as a debt and then, in a few years' time, I'll write it off as a bad debt.' Postlethwaite was delighted that his tutor should have such confidence. But then he had to take the shine off it by adding , 'Of course, when you've got a face like a fucking stone archway, you can't go wrong.' The teacher's prediction proved right: Postlethwaite's geological features and rugged-sounding surname became his selling point. I was warned that I'd never get my name up in lights because there wouldn't be enough bulbs , he says , yet he proudly points out that in more than 40 years as an actor, he has never once had to sign on the dole. One of his first jobs took him to the Everyman in Liverpool, where director Alan Dosser assembled a company that included Julie Walters, Bill Nighy and Antony Sher. Willy Russell and Alan Bleasdale were the house playwrights. I couldn't believe my luck , says Postlethwaite. The first drama I ever saw was at the Everyman: Look Back in Anger , directed by Terry Hands. Seeing someone do the ironing on stage and talking in a northern accent made me feel that, yes, I can do this. Postlethwaite's early engagements took him to a sports centre in Billingham , a town more famed for its chemical industries than for classical drama. Timothy West had established a company there and even a powdered wig couldn't disguise Postlethwaite's unmistakable physiognomy. We did Congreve for people from the chemical plant. Prunella Scales sent me a telegram saying I was the best Restoration truck-driver she'd ever worked with. He also returned to the Bristol Old Vic , where Adrian Noble had begun to establish a reputation as a promising young interpreter of the classics. Among these was a memorable Duchess of Malfi featuring Helen Mirren and Bob Hoskins. Bob was great but I don't think he quite saw the point of iambic pentameter. He kept saying to Adrian Noble [adopts rough East-End accent] , Listen , Ade, you've got to cut the verbals, mate. No one's gonna have a clue what's going on, know what I'm saying?' Before Hollywood called , towards the end of the 1980s, Postlethwaite's career had hit Bottom - playing the ass in A Midsummer Night's Dream for the Royal Shakespeare Company was about as far as he expected to go. He had been acclaimed for his role as a drunken wife-beater in Terence Davies's movie Distant Voices, Still Lives, but Postlethwaite was almost 50 before he was mugged by the movies as he puts it. Yet his new-found celebrity also saved him from being mugged by a mugger: I was walking alone in New York at night , and could hear heavy footsteps following behind. I turned, ready to surrender my wallet, and the guy says, 'Weren't you in In the Name of the Father? I hadn't spoken to my dad for 30 years - after I saw that film, I got straight on the phone.' The most manic spell of his career came in the mid-1990s , when he made two Steven Spielberg blockbusters, The Lost World and Amistad, plus the low-budget British hit Brassed Off in the same year. Spielberg was moved to say Postlethwaite was the best actor in the world, though Postlethwaite says: I think what he actually said was that Pete thinks he's the best actor in the world. The number - and quality - of Postlethwaite's films has tailed off in recent years: he made a solid contribution in The Constant Gardener , but also ran through the motions as Father Brennan in an uninspiring remake of The Omen, and was in the frame for a Razzle award for his part in the sci-fi fiasco Aeon Flux. But he is due to appear alongside Christopher Plummer and Shirley MacLaine in the Richard Attenborough venture, and is preparing to shoot a film about the signing of the Magna Carta, with a new British production company. Despite Postlethwaite's decision to choose future projects with care, he has no immediate plans to retire. Actors aren't judges or brain surgeons , he says. We pose no risk to the public if we decide to keep going. His one unfulfilled ambition is to play King Lear , and discussions are underway for him to take on the role at Liverpool Everyman as part of the city's Capital of Culture celebrations in 2008. Nothing's fixed as yet - but it would be nice to go back to the place that inspired me to become an actor in the first place. It may not happen , but I'm determined to play Lear before I die. In the meantime , there is Prospero to prepare for, a character who says that every third thought shall be my grave. Postlethwaite drains the last of his Guinness. Well , it doesn't do to become too morbid, he concludes. I'm not going to spend the rest of my life worrying about death. 00b7 The Tempest is at Manchester Royal Exchange from May 23 to July 7. Box office: 0161-833 9833. Distant Voices , Still Lives has just been rereleased.  ",

In fact, the economy is 201cvery important 201d to the majority of registered voters and outstrips any other issue, including health care and terrorism, according to a recent survey by the Pew Research Center. The sad reality, however, is that these voters won 2019t get what they want, no matter who ultimately heads to Washington, namely because too many Americans have developed a nasty case of economic hypochondria. How can any politician fix what isn 2019t really broken? It has been more than five years since America emerged from the Great Recession, and most economic indicators have improved ever since. GDP climbed by 4.6% last quarter, which is tied for the best mark since 2007. The national unemployment rate fell to 5.9% in September, which not only is its best mark since 2008 but is actually lower than it was for most of the 1980s. Even the number of long-term unemployed has been cut by more than a quarter over the past year. Gas prices are way down, and the stock markets, despite some recent volatility, are hanging around record highs. All those factors have led 42% of Americans to say they 2019re in 201cexcellent or good 201d financial shape, according to another Pew poll. The trouble is that only 21% of respondents in the same poll say the economy is in 201cgood or excellent 201d condition. This disconnect is also reflected when 56% expect their personal finances to improve over the next year, but only 22% expect economic improvement over the same period. And then there 2019s this stunner: According to a summer poll by the Public Religion Research Institute, 72% of Americans still think we 2019re in a recession, down just barely from 76% when the same question was asked in 2012. A CASE OF THE BLAHS A poll by the Pew Research Center found that three-quarters of Americans believe the economy will be either the same or worse a year from now.Graphic Source: Pew Research Center I 2019ve come up with three explanations for this massive disconnect, in ascending order of importance. SHELL SHOCK. Most American adults had experienced economic downturns before 2008, but few had experienced anything quite as severe or wide ranging as the Great Recession. It 2019s the sort of thing that some people just can 2019t get over; many put up mental defenses to make sure they don 2019t get fooled again.

We media folks also don 2019t like getting egg on our faces, and you could have cooked a lifetime of omelets on our foreheads in 2008. So we keep predicting that bubbles will burst. Plus, bad news sells better than good news. So we overplay the high unemployment figures and underplay the low ones. We explain that top-line figures like unemployment rates aren 2019t really reflective of the current environment, but we use the exact same measurements when nostalgically harking back to economic boom times. Political calculus. In theory, both political parties should claim ownership of economic improvements. But rather than advocate for a continuation of current policy, each party has determined that the smarter electoral strategy is to claim that everything is awful and the other side 2019s fault. That is true of both incumbents and challengers. Rather than 201cOur policies helped you find a job, 201d we hear 201cYou can 2019t get work because we aren 2019t able to implement our policies. 201d Even if a voter has a good job with gold-plated benefits, he remains immersed in political discourse about those who don 2019t. You may think I 2019m waving pompoms past the economic graveyard. But I 2019m no cockeyed cheerleader. In fact, I 2019m downright pessimistic. The less we are willing to recognize the economy we have, the more likely we are to elect representatives who stoke economic fear because they have little else to offer. And if that happens, we will indeed end up with a lousy economy. Subscribe to Dan Primack 2019s daily newsletter at GetTermSheet.com. This story appears in the November 17, 2014 issue of Fortune.  ",

   "input": " 2018White Bird in a Blizzard 201d develops engine trouble early on, right around the time it asks us to accept Eva Green as a desperate suburban housewife. The Paris-born actress ( 201cCasino Royale, 201d 201cDark Shadows 201d) is beautiful in that willowy French way, but she has shoulders that seem to stoop under the weight of depravity and eyes that could challenge Death himself to a chess match (Green would win, no contest). Offering her up as an oppressed all-American homemaker with a wimpy husband (Christopher Meloni) and a rebellious teenage daughter (Shailene Woodley) is like putting escargot on the menu at Applebee 2019s. Green 2019s character, Eve Collins, goes missing in the first few scenes of Gregg Araki 2019s drama, and her absence nags at the daughter, Kat, like a toothache. Based on the novel by Laura Kasischke, 201cWhite Bird in a Blizzard 201d is told from the girl 2019s point of view as she explores her sexuality with the stoner kid next door (Shiloh Fernandez) and the ex-Marine police detective (Thomas Jane) tasked with solving the mother 2019s disappearance. Truth be told, it 2019s good to see Woodley ( 201cThe Fault in Our Stars, 201d 201cThe Spectacular Now 201d) play something other than a sweetie-pie. Kat is not particularly nice and not terribly bright, but she knows what (and who) gets her pulse racing. It 2019s a neat portrait of a girl playing at being a tart before signing up for a life of bourgeois respectability. After plowing a willful path of queer teen drama and self-conscious artificiality with 1995 2019s 201cThe Doom Generation 201d and other early works, Araki has lost his way in recent years. 201cMysterious Skin 201d (2004) was his best film, the 2007 stoner comedy 201cSmiley Face 201d his most conventional, and 2010 2019s 201cKaboom 201d went straight to video on demand. 201cWhite Bird 201d seems like a halfhearted holding maneuver, a movie unsure of what it 2019s even about. The most interesting character, the mother, is the hole at the movie 2019s center, and in flashback sequences, Green gives a genuinely unsettling performance, with moments of madness, sanity, and outrageous sexuality. If Isabella Rossellini 2019s character in 201cBlue Velvet 201d had settled down and had kids, she might look something like this. Oddly, 201cWhite Bird in a Blizzard 201d turns slowly into a mystery thriller, as Kat starts suspecting that her non-entity of a father may know more than he 2019s letting on. The intentional blandness of the writing keeps us from wanting to push further, though. Araki peppers the film with interesting faces 2014 Gabourey Sidibe ( 201cPrecious 201d) as Kat 2019s high school party pal, Dale Dickey as the stoner 2019s blind mother, Angela Bassett as a therapist, Sheryl Lee (Laura Palmer herself!) as dad 2019s new girlfriend 2014 but he gives them too little to do. Only Jane, as the cop who knows exactly what Mrs. Collins 2019s wayward daughter needs, has the sense of threat the movie is seeking. His and Woodley 2019s scenes together are dirty and alive. They 2019re the only ones that feel that way. With 201cWhite Bird in a Blizzard, 201d Araki seems to be revisiting old haunts and trying to remember why they mattered to him. The film is set in the late 1980s and early 1990s if only to have this director 2019s beloved alt-rock from the period on the soundtrack: Cocteau Twins, New Order, The Jesus and Mary Chain, The Cure.

   "input": "FORTUNE 2014 It was the 201cget 201d of a lifetime. In late 1986, Marc Rich 2013 2013 America 2019s most-wanted white-collar fugitive 2013 2013 agreed to spend an entire day with me in his sanctuary, the famously ritzy hamlet of Zug, Switzerland. No other U.S. journalist had ever spoken to the shy, secretive Rich. But smoking Cuban cigars and downing diet-Cokes in his office, his narrow face framed with black, bushy sideburns, the patrician, soft-spoken Rich was amazingly confessional and candid. 201cI 2019ve been portrayed in a horrible way, 201d he told me. 201cAs a workaholic, a loner, a money machine. I 2019m a modest, quiet person who has never done anything illegal. 201d What followed that day was a kind of moveable investigative feast that started in the six-story blue-reflecting glass headquarters of his company, Marc Rich AG, and shifted to his chalet-style home overlooking the misty lake of Zug, where I viewed his collection of Miros and Giacomettis and listened to his songwriter wife Denise laud what she described as Marc 2019s mythic strength and generosity. On June 26th, Marc Rich died at age 78, still living near Zug. In the years between, he 2019d seen the trading firm he built from a cramped apartment grow into Glencore Xstrata, the world 2019s biggest commodities trader, endured a bitter divorce from Denise that cost him a reported $365 million, and had striven unsuccessfully to settle the charges against him and restore his reputation. In a final twist to his mercurial saga, Rich deployed his fortune and dues from politicians to secure a full pardon from Bill Clinton on the former president 2019s final day in office in 2001, virtually the only time a fugitive has ever been exonerated, and a decision universally vilified by both the press and the prosecutors who worked on and followed Rich 2019s case. Back in 1986, I was thrilled to secure that exclusive because Rich wasn 2019t just another tycoon on the lam, like Robert Vesco, then domiciled in Cuba. This brilliant trader was accomplishing one of the most extraordinary, unlikely feats in the annals of capitalism: Running a global commodities colossus trading everything from aluminum to zinc beyond the reach of prosecutors, who 2019d indicted him in the biggest tax fraud case in U.S. history on charges that carried a 325-year jail term. I 2019d actually written a story on Rich, 201cSecrets on Marc Rich, 201d three years earlier with my colleague Ford Worthy, without his cooperation. In reporting that story, I 2019d closely followed his extraordinary career and the highly publicized case that barely slowed his remarkable ascent. In 1982, U.S. Attorney Rudy Giuliani convened a grand jury to investigate if Marc Rich AG had violated the price controls on newly-produced oil to generate $105 million in illegal profits, then shipped the money offshore to dodge $48 million in taxes. Rich unwisely refused to cooperate with the investigation, claiming that Marc Rich AG was a Swiss company and shielded from American laws, even though Rich had long been running the company from New York. Rich later argued that Swiss secrecy laws prevented him from releasing documents, a position that infuriated prosecutors. MORE: Exclusive: ATV partners forming new spinout VC fund Fearing they 2019d be indicted, Rich and his partner Pincus Green fled to Switzerland, where their company had a big trading operation. Several months later, the grand jury issued a 65-count charge against Rich and Green that encompassed the oil price violations, tax fraud, and trading oil with Iran during the hostage crisis in 1980 and 1981. Had Rich and Green simply agreed to settle the case, they would probably have avoided any criminal action, and been lauded as extraordinary entrepreneurs instead of reviled as fugitives. The oil majors routinely abused the maddeningly complex, misguided oil price controls and escaped prosecution by paying fines. Even as fugitives, Rich and Green skillfully used money and machinations to keep their business thriving. After Giuliani criminally indicted their U.S. subsidiary, Rich and Green paid $50,000 a day in fines for more than a year to maintain operations and finally settled all charges for $150 million (total cost: $171 million). That left even their U.S. arm as free to trade as any rival. The Swiss government refused American demands to extradite Rich and Green on the grounds that tax evasion isn 2019t a crime in Switzerland. Spain, where Rich had worked for 13 years for trading house Philipp Bros, granted Rich citizenship, and also refused to extradite him. Rich regularly vacationed at his seaside pleasure dome in Marbella, comprising three sleek houses shaded by Lebanese pines with room for forty guests, hosting an A-list of celebrities that included opera star Placido Domingo. His money also won him great favor among the Swiss. The attorney general of the canton of Zug and other officials served on the boards of charities he established. Those officials didn 2019t relish answering questions about their benefactor. 201cYou 2019re not going to squeeze me like a lemon, 201d remarked one person I was attempting to interview. During my reporting on the first Rich story, I 2019d learned that his life story had been a primer in the art of survival. An only child, Rich was born in Antwerp, where his father was a prominent diamond dealer. The family fled the Nazis to Morocco, and spent nightmarish weeks confined to an interment camp. Rich arrived as a seven-year old refugee in, of all places, Kansas City, where his father opened a jewelry store. A few years later, the family moved to New York, and his father established a highly successful burlap bag exporting business. In 1963, Rich dropped out of NYU to work in the mailroom of commodities giant Philipp Bros. Over the next 21 years, Rich performed brilliantly in a series of foreign assignments, including that long stint in Spain, rising to become heir apparent to trading legend Ludwig Jesselson. But Rich and Green clashed with Jesselson over their bonuses in 1973, then departed with half-a-dozen of Jesselson 2019s best traders to start their own operation, named for Marc Rich himself, that would eventually dwarf their alma mater. MORE: Can Microsoft 2019s games whisperer save Zynga? When I approached Rich in 1986 for an interview, he dispatched his attorney, Leonard Garment, to Paris to interview me first, as a kind of audition. Garment was the ultimate politically connected attorney, with a glittering resume that including a two year-stint as special counsel to President Nixon. Garment regaled me with stories of how he 2019d befriended Nixon when he joined Garment 2019s law firm while in the political wilderness in the early 1960s, and how, after a story appeared in which Garment confessed 201cI can be mean, 201d the President took him aside at a White House reception and lectured him, no humor intended, 201cNow, Len, don 2019t be mean! 201d Garment was also a former jazz musician who played saxophone in a New York-based band alongside section-mate Alan Greenspan. Garment confided to me that Rich had summoned a group of his closest friends and advisors from far and wide to discuss whether he should grant the interview. Among the counselors was an octogenarian rabbi and hotel magnate from Spain who 2019d been a mentor to Rich. At one point, Garment related, the sage rabbi interrupted the discussion to ask, 201cThis Tully, is he Jewish? 201d evoking gales of laughter from the assembled, and a rejoinder from Garment that Tully was most likely a nice Irish boy. The highly personable and widely respected Garment recommended that Rich speak to me. The discussions began in his Zug headquarters appointed with salmon pink carpeting and elevators streaming soft jazz. I opened with questions about the business. Even though Rich couldn 2019t travel to most of the countries where he did business for fear of being arrested by Interpol, his company was already gigantic. Rich gave me numbers that no other reporter knew: Marc Rich AG generated $12 billion a year in trading volumes, earning around $100 million a year, figures that would multiply in the years to come. A swashbuckler, he swore, he was not. 201cWe 2019re not sexy or speculative, 201d he said, 201cWe buy commodities only after lining up a buyer first, and take a small markup or commission. Buying commodities any other way is incredibly risky. 201d Rich exuded an air of dour, world-weary gentility. He spoke in extremely soft tones, with a slight European accent that was hard to place. His account of his rupture with Jesselson was typically understated: 201cJesselson talked about handing over responsibility to me, but he really didn 2019t mean it. He still wanted to control the company. 201d Notoriety clearly disturbed him. 201cPeople point and gesture when I walk into a restaurant, 201d he complained. He confessed to being extremely shy, and even unforceful. 201cWhen I fire a person, sometimes they don 2019t notice right away, 201d he quipped. In the course of interviewing present and former colleagues, another highly impatient, demanding side emerged. Rich apparently hated long-winded conversations. His office featured an electrically operated door so that Rich could buzz in visitors without leaving his desk. When bored, he 2019d leave his desk without saying a word and buzz himself out, dispatching an underling to finish the meeting. It was also clear from those conversations that Rich could evoke tremendous loyalty. His Swiss attorney and others said that Rich would write highly emotional, handwritten letters thanking them for a job well done, or congratulating them on a wedding or the birth of a child. My overall impression: Rich was so colorless he was colorful. He did show flashes of humor. Asked where he could travel, he declined all specifics, except to note, 201cNot to the U.S., that would be a one-way trip! 201d To my amazement, we were joined by someone I never thought I 2019d meet, Rich 2019s partner, Pincus Green. The Brooklyn-bred Green had avoided extradition by becoming a Bolivian. I 2019d heard that Green was a great jokester with a style all his own 2013 2013 he 2019d stand in line at airports to travel coach, explaining, 201cIt 2019s the same airplane, why pay more? 201d An Orthodox Jew, Green drove around his neighborhood in nearby Zurich in a mud-spattered Oldsmobile. Upon entering Marc 2019s office, the tall, crew-cut Green declared, 201cYou came to see Marc, so here I am! 201d Known as the 201cAdmiral, 201d Green was practically a walking database of shipping rates, especially for oil tankers. That elicited the query, Pinky, how 2019s the oil business? He quipped: 201cIsn 2019t that the stuff you pack sardines in? 201d I don 2019t know what inspired this question, but it was inspired: 201cPinky, what do you think of women 2019s liberation? 201d Answer: 201cNever heard of it! 201d MORE: The lifestyle of Rich, the infamous (Fortune, 1986) At lunchtime, we drove to Rich 2019s hilltop home, named Himmelreich, which is German for paradise. Rich spoke Spanish with his three daughters, and even to 201cMacho, 201d his terrier. Denise Rich was the antithesis of her husband, a gregarious optimist who gushed, 201cI 2019m surrounded by positive energy! 201d She described how when they first met, Marc had invited her on a date on New Year 2019s Eve in 1965, and she agreed to go if he could find dates for her roommate and another friend. He complied, and when he heard her mother was in a New York hospital, the relentless trader tracked her down and sent her flowers. Denise also described how the family, avid skiers all, had taken an unmarked trail while on a vacation in Squaw Valley, and gotten hopelessly lost. It was her stalwart husband who kept them walking and praying, she said, until they were found, almost frozen to death, two days later. Denise had just written a hit called 201cFrankie 201d for the group Sister Sledge, and issued an album for MCA, 201cSweet Pain of Love. 201d She said she 2019d pondered writing a tune called 201cMarc Against the World. 201d My story appeared under the title, 201cLifestyle of Rich the Infamous, 201d a derivation on the TV show, 201cLifestyles of the Rich and Famous. 201d It 2019s hardly surprising that Rich liked neither the story nor the title, although I 2019d found him both frank and humble, and clearly a business genius. If ever two people less needed to cheat or scheme to make money 2013 2013 if they did as prosecutors allege 2013 2013 it was Marc Rich and Pincus Green. Despite the Clinton pardons, Green got one as well, this brilliant pair never redeemed their tarnished reputations. Seldom has so much wealth, so much success, even so much grudging respect from rivals, been overshadowed by so much tragedy 2013 2013 tragedy they brought on themselves.  ",

The National Retail Federation said on Wednesday that retail sales for November and December rose 4%, roughly in line with its initial forecast and the industry 2019s best showing in three years. The number is likely to come as a relief to retailers after a slow start to the season despite efforts to spur early spending with aggressive deals at the start of November. The industry group characterized the growth as a turning point for retail after years of reticence on the part of shoppers to spend 2014and hold out for deals 2014as they grappled with slow job growth and the absence of meaningful wage gains. 201cThere is every reason to believe that we have moved well beyond the days of consumer pessimism and that the trajectory for retailers continues to point up, 201d said NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay. The NRF had forecast holiday sales, which excludes gas, would rise 4.1%. With the U.S. economy creating 3 million jobs in 2014 and gas prices at multi-year lows giving consumers billions more to spend, holiday revelers picked up their spending in December and salvaged a season that initially looked worrisome after spending during the Thanksgiving Black Weekend Friday plummeted 11%. Earlier deals simply brought spending sooner in November. But the U.S. job creation machine kicked into high gear, especially later in the year 2014December was the 11th consecutive month of job gains above 200,000 2014the longest such stretch in 20 years, bringing the unemployment rate to 5.6%. And while wages didn 2019t rise much, people worked more hours, giving them more money to spend. 201cThis is the best the U.S. economy has looked since before the recession, 201d former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said earlier this week at NRF 2019s annual retail industry convention as he predicted more strength in 2015 and beyond. A number of big retailers have reported their holiday numbers already, reflecting this renewed mood to spend. J.C. Penney JCP said last week comparable sales rose 3.7%, easily beating Wall Street forecasts, while at Macy 2019s M , there were up 2.1%. Department stores had been struggling in the fall as consumers cut back on spending on apparel to shift more of it to home repairs. According to the NRF, stores selling furniture and electronics saw some of the biggest gains, while general merchandise retailers saw the lowest. Yet there were some areas of retail that were surprisingly weak. MasterCard Advisors said luxury sales had declined in each of the last three months of the year, and Gap Inc GPS at its namesake and Banana Republic chains.  ",

Specifically that means selling Universal, leaving it with just one significant asset, the French TV and movie business Canal+. No way, says Vivendi.

   "input": "Updated MAR 24, 2015 5:11p ET TUCSON, Ariz. -- The shimmy is still there, and so is the determination. They'll be there Thursday when Arizona faces Xavier in the Sweet 16. But the smiles are fewer and farther between for Arizona's do-everything forward Rondae Hollis-Jefferson. He's still affable, but all these NCAA games are part of a business trip for the full-throttle sophomore who has been asked to guard everyone and everything but the front door. People can tell I'm more on the aggressive side , more focused or straight forward, said Hollis-Jefferson , which is in contrast to the happy-go-lucky, free-spirited personality he's often showed in his two years in Tucson. He's turned it up since the regular season ended, especially on the defensive end. He helped limit Ohio State's D'Angelo Russell to nine points on 3-of- 19 shooting on Saturday. I like this side , he said of his increased intensity. I like the way I'm playing. It feels comfortable. In the Pac-12 Tournament he admitted he was a bit peeved he was overlooked when it came to Defensive Player of the Year (which went to Oregon State's Gary Payton II) , so he put the clamps down on his opponents. Over the first weekend of the NCAA tournament, that continued. He calls it being in attack mode , and it's not about to change. Likewise for the shimmy at the free-throw stripe. Sean Miller is used to it, but he'll have to face another coaching friend in Chris Mack, Xavier's head coach. Before Miller left Xavier for UA in 2009, Mack was Miller's right -hand man for the Musketeers. When Xavier chose Mack as Miller's replacement then, Miller was quoted as saying, Xavier doesn't make mistakes , when hiring coaches. Mack is the latest on an Xavier coaching three that goes back through Miller , Thad Matta, the late Skip Prosser and Pete Gillen. Matta was on the opposing bench on Saturday when Arizona defeated Ohio State. Sean gave me a heck of an opportunity to come back to my alma mater , Mack said after his team Georgia State to advance to the Sweet 16. He put a lot of responsibility and trust in me. He ultimately really pushed for me to become the head coach , and for that I'm eternally grateful. It's hard to play against one of your best friends in the business. But it really won't matter to our guys, nor will it matter to Arizona, because they don't know me from a bucket of paint. With former Arizona All-America point guard Damon Stoudamire and former Pittsburgh guard Miller on Arizona's coaching staff , T.J. McConnell said it's not hard to gain lots of insider knowledge about playing the point for the Wildcats. McConnell was a guest on Jim Rome's radio show on Monday, and he was asked to compare his game to that of his coaches. Coach (Miller) has still got it , McConnell told Rome. And Coach Stoudamire has still got it , too. (But) I'd have to say I'm the third best out of the three. When pressed to be less politically correct , McConnell rephrased his answer. You know what? I have to change my mind. I have to be first on that list , he said. I'm not sure about those two. They can duke it out. I certainly belong first on that list. Kidding aside , McConnell said he was grateful for the coaching of Stoudamire and Miller. In the Xs and Os , he's taught me more than I ever thought I could learn, McConnell said of Miller. He's been the father figure I haven't had because my parents aren't here (in Tucson). Just last week , McConnell moved into third place in Arizona's record book for assists in a season with 228, passing Stoudamire. He's three shy of Reggie Geary's 231 and 19 behind Russell Brown's 247 set in 1978-79. It's really an honor to be in the same conversation as Coach Stoudamire , he said. There's a reason why this place is called 'Point Guard U.' He's a big reason it's called that. He then joked , I guess I do have some bragging rights against him. I'll tease him about that for sure. McConnell then said he has to realize Stoudamire made more than $100 million in his playing career -- and I will probably never make close to that.

   "input": "Brad Griffith got the idea for his startup after missing part of a baseball game while struggling to buy last minute tickets online. As part of the ordeal, he ended up having to duck into the basement of a local bar to print the tickets. Griffith realized that there should be a better way. His solution was to create Gametime, a last-minute sports ticket marketplace. On Thursday, the company said it has raised $13 million in new funding to expand its business. Inspired by Griffith 2019s experience, Gametime has focused on making tickets as easy as possible to buy and use with a smartphone. After transactions are complete, the company 2019s app displays the digital tickets and their barcodes for admission into the venue. Tickets can also be easily transferred to friends via text message and email. But with an already crowded industry with several well-established companies like Ticketmaster and StubHub, the question is why sports fans should use Gametime. For early investor Jeff Mallett, the answer building a product with the user in mind that comes with convenience. In a conversation with Fortune, Griffith added that focusing on mobile is also the company 2019s strategy to appeal to millennials 2014 a buzzword for teens and young adults whose generation uses smartphones more than any other device. But despite the obvious convenience of electronic tickets, some teams still require paper tickets, something Gametime can only help with by providing printable PDF versions. It 2019s still up the teams to open the gates of convenience. Mallett, who is part owner of the San Francisco Giants and a former chief operating officer for Yahoo, also believes that Gametime will be in good shape as long as it continues to perfect its ticket search algorithm and to add to the number of ticket suppliers in its system. It currently pulls supply from other marketplaces, individual ticket brokers, and ticket broker networks. It takes a cut of up to 15%, depending on the seller. While the company does work directly with some sports teams, Mallett doesn 2019t foresee Gametime as relying on such partnerships. Griffith added that as a secondary marketplace, the company also doesn 2019t have to really worry about exclusivity deals 2014 something primary ticket sellers have been fighting over for years. He also sees 201cthe couch or the bar 201d as his company 2019s main competition because they 2019re the easier or cheaper alternatives to buying tickets, althoug that may be a bit of wishful thinking. But as the company works to grow beyond the 35 cities it 2019s currently serves, attracting new customers and gaining recognition will be the real challenges, Mallett said. Gametime 2019s mostly benefitted from word-of-mouth so far, but it will need a lot more if it wants to aggressively expand its marketshare. While the company declined to share specifics, it said that it currently sells just over 5% of tickets at any given San Francisco Giants baseball game, which is not surprising since the city is its most established market. But competitors are raking in big bucks: Ticketmaster brought in $1.37 billion in 2012, and StubHub generated $2.8 billion in sales in 2013, according to the Wall Street Journal. Gametime is also planing to expand beyond sports, into concerts and other shows in the next 12 months, something that will surely come with its own challenges. Accel Partners led the Gametime 2019s funding latest round. Other investor included Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Devils co-owner David Blitzer, and Trunk Club founders Brian Spaly and John Tucker; and previous investors Mallett, Tibco founder and Sacramento Kings owner Vivek Ranadive, and Box founder Aaron Levie. The company previously raised a total of $5 million in funding. For more about online sports, watch this Fortune video:  ",

   "input": "With 134 million people around the globe currently watching eSports, according to SuperData Research, it was only a matter of time before gambling and fantasy sports businesses sprouted around professional video gaming. Three startups 2014Vulcun, AlphaDraft, and Unikrn 2014have staked a claim on eSports fans wanting to further immerse themselves in the action. Ali Moiz, founder of Vulcun, believes fantasy eSports could become a $250 million a year industry by 2020. And the good news for traditional fantasy sports is that Moiz has seen 201cmostly no overlap so far, 201d so these companies are tapping into a new audience. Vulcun has raised over $13.4 million, which has helped the company pay out over $1.1 million in prizes to over 117,000 fans in its first three months. Gamers assemble their own fantasy teams and compete in daily competitions. 201cSince fantasy sports is a game of skill, it allows sports fans that really get into it to consistently win over time, 201d Moiz says. 201cThis is different from betting, where winning or losing is random over time. Fantasy sports engages fans with their favorite sport in a deeper, more engaged way. That is why leagues such as the NBA, MLB, and NHL have all gotten involved with 200bdaily fantasy leagues. Because it 2019s good for the sport, and good for the fans. 201d Meanwhile, AlphaDraft just closed its $4.2 million seed round, based on convertible notes. Lead investors are Metaphorphic, WME, Upfront, IDG, KEC, MV, and Greycroft, including former NBA Commissioner David Stern. With the funding, AlphaDraft will pay out at least $5 million in cash and prizes in its first year, aiming to have over 1 million active users by the end of 2015. Todd Peterson, CEO of AlphaDraft, says many fans started out playing video games before watching players and teams compete professionally. Fantasy eSports allows fans to take an active role competing for prizes and showing off in-depth knowledge of the matches and the players. Taking a different approach to eSports gambling is Unikrn, which is offering traditional 201csafe and legal wagering 201d according to Rahul Sood, CEO and co-founder of Unikrn. Built on an online community of nearly 10 million gamers in over 100 countries, Unikrn has raised over $3 million, with over $5 million committed. The company has also signed an exclusive deal with Tabcorp, a $5 billion dollar Australian wagering company, which also became an investor in Unikrn. Unikrn provides access to live viewing, live discussions, and competitive odds to gaming fans globally, including in the US. In legal sports betting jurisdictions, Unikrn users can bet on the outcome of matches and tournaments, with further bet types to follow. 201cThe average amount placed on bets has increased by 350% since we started, and we only see it growing, 201d Sood says. 201cObviously there is a learning curve associated with betting on eSports, but as you 2019ll see with our future products we 2019ll be able to address this and make it accessible to anyone in a legal jurisdiction to participate. 201d All three companies are currently focusing on the fan base of Riot Games 2019 League of Legends due to the game 2019s immense viewership, but AlphaDraft and Unikrn are planning to expand to other games. 201cThis is a very big space with much potential, 201d Peterson says. 201cIf the video game industry currently rivals the size of traditional sports as a whole, and eSports is the size of any of the major individual sports, there 2019s a lot of room for friendly competition and further specialization, as the industry matures. 201d  ",

   "input": "LONDON, May 6 2014 Prince Charles was granted an injunction today to prevent the publication of purported transcripts of telephone calls he made from Australia to his fiancee, Lady Diana Spencer, and his mother, Queen Elizabeth II. Illicit tape-recordings of the calls were allegedly made last month while the Prince was staying at the ranch of a friend, Sinclair Hill, 300 miles northwest of Sydney. The tapes were then transcribed and the transcripts were given to a British freelance journalist, Simon Regan, who had already upset the royal family with an unflattering biography called ''Charles, the Clown Prince.'' Mr. Regan locked them in a Sydney bank vault and told his agents to see how much they would bring. The first publication to express interest was Die Aktuelle, a women's weekly in West Germany. One report said the magazine, which prints illustrated features of the love lives of prominent people, had paid $50,000. When news about the transcripts was published on Monday, a spokesman for Buckingham Palace said: ''This is a bad day for journalism. There couldn't be a more contemptible way to behave.'' According to those who have seen the transcripts, those dealing with the conversations between Prince Charles and and Lady Diana were innocuous - ''the kind of guarded conversation and chat one would expect from any engaged couple grappling with the problem of trying to convey feelings through the impersonal device of a telephone line,'' as one person put it. But another of the transcripts was said to have contained rude remarks by the Prince to his mother about the Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser. Publication of that document could damage relations between Australia and the Britain, already a bit strained, and would certainly doom the idea, which has already been shelved for the moment, of Charles's becoming Governor General of Australia after his marriage. ''The person responsible for the tapping is a republican and entirely politically motivated,'' Mr. Regan, the journalist, said. ''He is a telephone employee who would do anything he could to discredit Prince Charles.'' British Press Titillates Readers Predictably, the British press exploded in condemnation of the unknown tapper and of Mr. Regan, while titillating readers with hints of what might be on the tapes. Rumors circulated that some of the popular papers were planning to publish the transcripts if Die Aktuelle did. ''Euthanasia for eavesdroppers,'' said the headline over an outraged editorial in The Times, the traditional defender of the royal family. The paper said that publication in Britain ''would be an example of Peeping Tom journalism that would uphold no principle, meet no legitimate public requirement and do no good to the public reputation of the British press.'' Yesterday, the Prince's office, the Foreign Office and the British Embassy in Bonn explored the possibilities of going into a West German court to block publication.This afternoon, even though the Australian Communications Minister, Ian Sinclair, said the transcripts might be forgeries, Buckingham Palace sought a High Court injunction in London. It was granted in short order by Justice Sir Thomas Henry Bingham. Mr. Regan said that, if he still held the copyright over what he had written about the tapes, as well as the transcripts themselves, ''then the Palace have succeeded.'' But, he said, the lawyers for the West German magazine told him that they would not be stopped by a British injunction and that Die Aktuelle would publish the material in its next issue, which is to be printed on Friday and distributed in West Germany on Sunday.

   "input": "WASHINGTON, July 14 2014 Before his resignation today, Max C. Hugel was in charge of the largest directorate in the Central Intelligence Agency, the branch responsible for covert action and clandestine counterintelligence overseas. Mr. Hugel did not fit the mold for that job in two respects: He had not had a career in professional intelligence work; instead, he had been a businessman in New Hampshire and worked on the Reagan campaign staff in last year's Presidential election. And, unlike most of his predecessors, he did not come from an Ivy League-style ''gentlemen's club'' background. Mr. Hugel is portrayed in his unpublished autobiography and in the comments of his colleagues as a canny, ambitious, aggressive, impatient businessman who turned a small sewing machine company into a large import-export concern. Mr. Hugel said in the manuscript that he had developed a strong sense of competitiveness, knowing that he would otherwise ''fade away.'' And several times he refers to being short, or small, and says his size motivated him to learn to anticipate and avoid problems and to sharpen his wits. 'Tough Little Street Fighter' A business associate spoke admiringly of Mr. Hugel as a ''tough little street fighter from Brooklyn.'' Mr. Hugel's title was Deputy Director for Operations. Before March 1973, the job bore the title of Deputy Director for Plans. William E. Colby, who held the position in 1973 before he became Director of Central Intelligence, said in an interview today that he had asked James R. Schlesinger, then Director of Central Intelligence, to change the name because ''plans'' was a euphemism for what that part of the agency really did. Besides Mr. Colby, two other men who had previously been in charge of the directorate for plans, or operations, were promoted from within the agency to Directors of Central Intelligence. They were Allen W. Dulles and Richard Helms. Mr. Dulles and Mr. Colby were graduates of Princeton, and Mr. Helms was a graduate of Williams College, an old liberal arts college in northwestern Massachusetts. ''It would be very unusual to have a nonprofessional, a businessman, an ordinary civilian running the directorate for operations,'' said Thomas Powers, author of a recent biography of Mr. Helms. ''That's certainly never happened before. That's one position where you want a professional. That's where the heart of the agency always was, and that's the office in which Presidents were always most interested.'' Supervised Recruitment of Spies Presidents took an interest in the office because its covert agents could, at the President's behest, foment unrest in foreign countries. In addition, the Deputy Director for Operations supervised the recruitment of spies overseas, collecting minutely detailed information about low-level clerks in Soviet embassies abroad, for example. The Deputy Director also had authority over counterintelligence operations designed to learn about Soviet activities in general. Officials in the Reagan Administrtion said that William J. Casey, the Director of Central Intelligence, had recruited Mr. Hugel because Mr. Casey thought his rough-and-tumble style was exactly what was needed to rebuild the clandestine service. Some agency officials had become extremely cautious about conducting covert operations after years of Congressional investigations exposing unsuccessful and aborted projects, including plans to assassinate foreign leaders. Adept at Commercial Covers In addition, Mr. Casey was said by agency officials to have believed that Mr. Hugel would be adept at helping develop commercial covers for American intelligence agents operating overseas. Mr. Hugel, according to a biography distributed by the intelligence agency, specialized in Japanese economics at the University of Michigan, from which he was graduated in 1953. Earlier, he established a company, Brother International, to sell Japanese-made sewing machines in the United States. Illustrations: photo of Max C. Hugel and Allen W.

   "input": "ALL of the candidates running for Governor this year have their own agendas, their schedules of priorities designed to bring them victory. Governor Byrne, whom the state constitution bars from seeking a third term, also has his agenda. Naturally, he wants to see a Democrat elected, more specifically a Democrat who will not dismantle some of the programs closest to Mr. Byrne's heart, like the protection of the pinelands. The Governor has not endorsed anyone in the 11-man Democratic primary field, although for the present he clearly is supporting the candidacy of John J. Degnan, the former Attorney General. A few days ago, Mr. Byrne reportedly paid a courtesy call on Francis G. Fitzpatrick, the former Mayor of Bayonne and chairman of the Turnpike Authority, to see if he could drum up some support for Mr. Degnan in Hudson County. Mr. Fitzpatrick, who was one of Mr. Byrne's early supporters in 1973, pointed out that his son was running for the State Assembly this year and supporting the gubernatorial candidacy of Mayor Thomas F.X. Smith of Jersey City, and so he would have to pass. Some other members of Mr. Byrne's administration, no doubt eager to please the boss, have been doing their own bit for Mr. Degnan's cause and perhaps overreaching just a little. Some employees whose jobs are of the unprotected patronage variety were told that they could work for Mr. Degnan in the primary campaign, but for no one else. One municipal official has told some friends that he was advised his town could be in line for additional Green Acres funds if he backed the former Attorney General. However, there is no indication that Mr. Degnan was aware of the alleged offer. On his own behalf, Mr. Degnan appears to have put together the kind of support and fund-raising apparatus to make him a viable candidate in a short time. He has the endorsements of Peter Shapiro, the Essex County Executive; former Representrative Andrew Maguire of Ridgewood and State Senator John F. Russo of Toms River. What Mr. Degnan really needs is elbow room in Essex County, his putative base. He has the endorsement of Raymond Durkin, the county's Democratic chairman, but Mayor Kenneth A. Gibson of Newark and State Senator Frank J. Dodd of West Orange will certainly pull their own votes out of the Essex pie. Although he is backing Mr. Degnan at the moment, Mr. Byrne is keeping a neutral public profile so he can switch to another candidate if that should become necessary before the June 2 primary election. Mr. Degnan's campaign reportedly will have to show increasing strength in April, otherwise the Governor might be forced to look elsewhere for the possible successor he could support over the long haul. One candidate who could benefit if Mr. Degnan's campaign falters is State Senator Joseph P. Merlino of Trenton, Mr. Byrne attended a campaign dinner for Mr. Merlino recently, and has been heard to say during cabinet sessions that the state would be well served if Mr. Merlino, who is President of the Senate, should eventually win the governorship.

   "input": "LITTLE SILVER IT IS easy to miss Antiques and Uniques at 32 Willow Drive here. The white-clapboard building south of the business section is on a knoll and almost hidden from the road; however, the driveway leads to six rooms filled with country and formal furniture and accessories in a setting that is designed to seem like an attractively decorated house. There are nice starter pieces for a young family, and the prices are in line with new furniture, always a way to tell a good buy in an antique. A matching pair of light pine chests dating to about 1860 were priced at $400 each. The four-drawer chests had bracket feet that went into a modified cutout skirt, and there were attractive oval brass pulls and brass key escutcheons. The chests belonged to Dorothy Wild, who manages this cooperative of seven dealers. She also had a deep-seated Pennsylvania settle bench with a half-spindled back (two long, parallel back rails with a long row of vertical spindles below the lower rail) and a plank seat about six feet long. The bench, which had been refinished, was dated to about 1840 and priced at $595. In addition, Mrs. Wild had an 11-inch-tall vase of cloudy white Bristol glass from England. It had a blue footing and a fancily ruffled top edge flaring out from a narrow neck. Victorian, it was delicately trimmed with tiny pink blossoms and green leaves. It cost $35. A room called Blue Heron belongs to Mary McNitt, who also has a good selection of furniture. Her cupboards included a corner one of cherry that was 7 1 2 feet tall, 46 inches wide and had chamfered outer edges. The top section had most of its old glass in 12 panes. The lower section had two paneled doors and the piece itself had small, round brass knobs. Mrs. McNitt said that the cupboard came from a house in midwestern Pennsylvania and dated it to about 1840. The price was $3,300. A nice oddity was a yard-tall wooden marionette of Richard the Lion Hearted. Aside from a short, silky orange-colored kilt, it was covered almost entirely with a finely made suit of armor with ornate copper trim. A rosy papier-mache face peers out from under a visored helmet, which is adorned with a copper lion. According to Mrs. McNitt, the marionette, which was priced at $600, came from Sicily and was made around 1870. A walnut kitchen clock with an alarm was made by the E.N. Welch Manufacturing Company of Forestville, Conn. Two feet tall, it was in a cutout gingerbread style with a six-inch clockface and flowery gilt reverse painting on the lower glass section. The clock, which costs $210, was dated about 1880. In the front section of Antiques and Uniques is Linenworks, which is owned by Doree Marx. Furniture here is used as a backdrop for Mrs. Marx's collection of Victorian and turn-of-the-century clothes and linens. A blouse from the Edwardian era in size 10 or 12, and nipped in at the waist, was made of scrolled lace that is still in its fine original condition. The price was $345. There are lots of pretty pillows here, too. They are made of old lace pieces combined with newer materials, and Mrs. Marx has customers for them in Texas and New York City. A pair of white pillows - they were 16 inches square - was done in a filet crochet pattern called Garden Bouquet. The pair cost $56. Patricia Horanecke was selling an American Windsor side chair with a shaped pine seat and a birdcage back of ash. She dated the chair, which was priced at $225, to about 1810. From about 1830, Mrs. Horanecke had a Boston-style rocker in a size sometimes called ''Mother and Child.'' The seat was two feet wide and very low. Mrs. Horanecke believes that the rocker came from western New Jersey or New York State. Its old grain painting simulated bird's-eye maple, and it was decorated freehand and with stenciling. The price was $410. A Victorian Lincolnesque reclining chair looked like the precursor of the modern recliner. In a round mahogany frame with carved grapes at the top of the tall back, it was covered in red velveteen. Side knobs can lower the seat back, and a front foot-rest can be unfolded from under a leg rest and raised. Mrs. Hornecke said the chair came from the home of a Connecticut doctor. Its price was $750. In a corner called Libbie's Country Store were kitchen and store items in tin, iron and wood, plus some newer objects. An oval-shaped shoe-shine box of tin was 10 inches high and had an iron shoe rest on its top. Green and aqua flowers are painted on the sides, and the price is $22. And don't throw away that old washboard. There's one here for $8. The booth of Bill and Jean Barr was a little bare on a recent visit because they had not yet restocked after being cleaned out at a show the previous week. However, there was a nice large coverlet from Lancaster County, Pa., for $450. Dating to about 1830-40, it was in a double rose pattern with a triple tree border in blue, green and red on white. Judy Roche and Gail O'Brien were just moving in with boxes still unpacked. An Eastlake Victorian walnut mantel 52 inches long, eight inches deep and nine inches tall was carved in a repetitive fleur-delis and leaf design. It was $125. During the summer, Antiques and Uniques is open Monday through Friday from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. and on Saturdays from 11 A.M. to 1 P.M. The telephone number is (201) 741-2728.

   "input": "Terence H. Wrong's letter, ''At Long Last, Lebanon's Shiites Take a Stand'' (April 28), loudly proclaims that Lebanon's Shiites have suffered victimization at the hands of the Maronites (Lebanon's largest Christian community), the Turks, the Egyptians and the Israelis for the past 200 years. His allegation against the Maronites is highly questionable. Lebanon's current communal structure dates back to the Ottoman Turkish occupation of Lebanon, when a religious council was added to the political framework of the province in the 1840's. That chamber had two representatives from each religious community, including the Shiites. When Lebanon became an independent state in the wake of World War II, political offices were designated in accordance with a ''Lebanese formula'' to preserve communal independence while allowing for full political cooperation among the various sects. The president of the republic was to be a Lebanese Christian, the prime minister was selected from the Sunnite Moslem sect and the speaker of the chamber of deputies was chosen from the Shiite Moslem community. This was done to balance political and religious power to prevent the ''victimization'' of any sect at the hands of another. A prevalent misconception in the media coverage of the Lebanese ''civil war'' has implied that the Maronites are involved in a conspiracy against Lebanon's Moslem population to preserve a privileged economic position in the state. Lebanon's leftist coalition has skillfully propagated that position in order to undermine the pro-Western stance of the Lebanese Government. The Maronites have been singled out, maligned and raked over the coals unjustly. Their often-criticized prosperity is due largely to their modern (Western) outlook on life and the development of their own human resources. Clearly, it was not achieved at the expense of the Shiites or any other Lebanese community. The Shiites of Lebanon, throughout much of their history, have been allies of the Maronites against foreign forces impinging upon Lebanon's sovereignty. Currently, they support the Maronite forces of Sad Haddad in South Lebanon. Furthermore, Imam Musa al-Sadr, the noted Shiite spiritual leader in Lebanon, may have lost his life in August of 1979 for vociferously protesting that the war against the predominantly right-wing Maronites was unjustifiable.

   "input": "Wine could be as bad for your health as vodka, health officials say. (AAP) A British court has ruled that heavy drinking during pregnancy should not be considered a crime of violence against the child in a case that had raised concerns about criminalising mothers. The case was brought by a local authority applying to the government's criminal compensation authority for damages on behalf of a seven-year-old girl in its care who has severe disabilities after her mother drank heavily while pregnant. We have held that a mother who is pregnant and who drinks to excess... is not guilty of a criminal offence under our law if her child is subsequently born damaged as a result , the ruling on Thursday said. The local authority's lawyers had argued that the mother was reckless in her behaviour by drinking up to half a bottle of vodka and eight cans of strong lager a day while she was pregnant. While they do not suggest the damage was deliberate , they say she discussed her drinking with professionals and went on to take the risk. The ruling centred on whether a foetus can be considered a person under English law. The case has sparked heated debate over the dangers of alcohol and the rights of women and foetuses in a country where abortion has been legal since 1967. While there was no suggestion of charges against the mother , women's rights groups had warned that it risked opening the door to police action against other pregnant women with alcohol problems. Ann Furedi, head of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, and Rebecca Schiller, co-chair of Birthrights, hailed the decision saying: This is an extremely important ruling for women everywhere. The UK's highest courts have recognised that women must be able to make their own decisions about their pregnancies , they said in a joint statement. The Court of Appeal judgment caps a five-year legal battle between the council and the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA). The CICA considers applications for damages involving behaviour that could constitute a crime , in this case the alleged reckless administration of a noxious substance to the foetus. The girl, known only as CP, has a severe form of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), an umbrella term which covers a range of disorders varying from reduced intellectual ability to heart and kidney problems.

   "input": "Its been one year since Michael Lewis' 'Flash Boys' hit the shelves. What has been the impact of the book? It certainly sold books. Four consecutive weeks at Number 1 on the New York Times nonfiction list is quite a feat. And it generated a lot of debate. Remember, at heart, it's a book about market structure. A book about market structure that makes the bestseller list? Wow. It was the marketing that really made the book, and the timing. Lewis' main allegation 2014that the market is rigged in favor of high-frequency traders 2014fits in perfectly with the broader societal condemnation of the financial crisis and with the even broader folk mythology that the markets 2014and other human affairs 2014have always been manipulated by a small elite. To a certain extent , the book reflects what Richard Hofstadter famously called the paranoid style in American politics , the vague fear that there are dark , evil forces controlling us (and our money), that our fates are not our own. Regardless, the book had a substantial impact, of that there is no doubt. Let's try to keep this to a couple issues: HOW HAVE REGULATORS RESPONDED TO THE ALLEGATIONS? SEC Chair Mary Jo White emphatically stated that the markets are not rigged and , in Congressional testimony, said the retail investor was well served , very well served, by the current market structure. As for high-frequency trading (HFT) , she said it is not unlawful insider-trading. That doesn't mean the SEC is delighted with all aspects of market structure. In January , White created a Equity Market Structure Advisory Committee to advise the SEC on what, if any, changes need to be made. There is certainly a range of opinions on how much needs to be done to improve the markets at the SEC, but the lack of an emphatic response from them clearly indicates they do not believe the U.S. markets are in dire straits. On the enforcement front, the book generated some smoke, though it's debatable how much fire has been generated. The FBI, the U.S. attorney general, New York state prosecutors and the SEC have confirmed they are investigating the practices of high-speed firms. New York state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has been particularly active, even announcing that subpoenas were sent to exchanges to examine their relationships with HFTs. Yet, there have been remarkably few gotcha moments. In one small case , the NYSE did pay a $4.5 million fine over violations regarding co-location , or allowing HFTs to site their computers right next to the exchange's matching engine so that information can be accessed more rapidly. In another case , the exchange Direct Edge (now part of BATS) was fined $14 million in December 2014 for failing to follow rules regarding disclosure of how it handled order types. That investigation was underway long before the Lewis book came out, but the publicity likely accelerated the investigation. In perhaps the most high-profile case, the New York attorney general is currently embroiled in a dispute with Barclays over the way it has managed its dark pool, alleging that the bank did not tell traders about the presence of high-frequency traders in the pool. But these are actions against exchanges and a bank. There are few actions against HFTs themselves that are engaging in abusive or manipulative behavior. This is surprising , because I do believe that there are bad actors. I think it's highly likely that some HFT somewhere has tried to game the system, to engage in practices that could be considered abusive and manipulative under the law. Why do I believe this? Because the entire history of trading 2014for hundreds of years , long before HFT 2014are filled with examples of individuals who have tried to abuse the system. Why should high-frequency trading be different? That doesn't mean the whole system is rotten, it just means enforcement should be rigorous. In the case of HFT, much of the problem is that it is extraordinarily difficult to catch blatant abuse. It's hard because intent can be difficult to prove, and it's hard because in many cases the data isn't sufficiently robust to demonstrate abuse. The SEC is trying to remedy that. There are proposals out now for a Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT) that would allow regulators to efficiently and accurately track all activity throughout the U.S. markets. Let's hope the plan can be executed at a reasonable cost. Unfortunately, it appears to be years away from implementation. And FINRA has proposed the creation of the Comprehensive Automated Risk Data System, which will gather trading data from some 4,000 brokerages in over 110 million investor accounts. That, too, is some years away. Both of these proposals were well underway before Lewis' book. One rule that needs to be implemented immediately: the SEC is trying to require high frequency traders to register with the SEC. It's about time: if HFTs are such a big part of the trading process, why doesn't the SEC even know anything about them? This is a first step and hopefully this will be done by the end of this year. WHAT HAS BEEN THE RESPONSE OF THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY? For the most part, the industry 2014big banks, exchanges, and the mutual fund industry (with a few exceptions) has rejected the claims. It may not be surprising that the sell-side defends the status quo, but what about the buy-side? They, presumably, are getting the short end of the stick. Why, for example, haven't the big mutual funds issued denunciations? Even Jack Bogle, founder of Vanguard and no friend of high-frequency trading, has rejected the claim that the markets are rigged. And what about the companies whose stocks are supposedly being manipulated. Why aren't there more complaints? Why, for example, haven't we heard issuers and companies themselves complain more? Maybe there is a company that has made an issue of this on a quarterly conference call, but I don't know of one. Again, you can argue they are all corrupt, but do you really believe that? Isn't a more likely answer that: 1) this issue, if it is even a little true, is not among the highest priorities for funds, and 2) investors care a lot more about the long term returns of what they are buying, and those results have been excellent. Still, there have been some moves to change things, though they are not related to Lewis' book. In one significant move, mutual fund giant Fidelity, in conjunction with several other firms (including T. Rowe Price, Blackrock, and JPMorgan) are getting ready to launch a dark pool of their own, called Luminex, designed to only trade large blocks between institutional firms. That, when it launches, will be a significant development. HAS THE BOOK RESULTED IN ANY CHANGE IN MARKET STRUCTURE OR THE WAY STOCKS TRADE? The short answer is no, nor does it appear that any regulator has dramatically changed their course of action. You could say this is because: 1) the dark forces have totally corrupted all the enforcement agencies, or 2) the enforcement agencies are alert to the prospect of bad actors, but most do not believe the overall market structure needs to be completely overhauled. If you believe that 1) is the right choice, nothing I'm going to say is going to change your mind. But I've spent years with enforcement officials, and the NYSE, and the Nasdaq, and everyone else who built the current system. Most have told me that the current system is not being torn down because it is a vast improvement over the old system, and by old I mean the system controlled by the NYSE (specialists) and Nasdaq (screen-based traders) that was the dominant paradigm until about 20 years ago. Remember , 30 years ago if you wanted to buy 1,000 shares of IBM it would have: 1) cost you hundreds, and possibly thousands, of dollars, and 2) taken anywhere from 20 minutes to the following day to get a confirmation of execution. This was a time when the spread between the bid and ask was $0.125, then $0.0625, and then finally a penny in the year 2000. Today, you can buy 1,000 shares of IBM and the cost could be as low as $7.99, with a confirmation that will occur in a sub-second interval. This advance has nothing to do with HFT, it has to do with technological progress, but regardless, it is an improvement over the old system for retail investors. Still, I am not a complete apologist for the current system. I think it is way too complicated (40 dark pools, 3 exchanges) which leaves the system open to technological failure. I also am no fan of the idea that exchanges should be paying customers to trade on their exchanges. To the extent that Lewis' book shed light on a rather obscure part of the market, it has been a valuable contribution to the debate. But I also recognize that there's always been intermediaries, and that throughout history, people have bitterly complained any time someone steps between a buyer and a seller and tries to make a profit, big or small, justified or not.

   "input": "On the evening of Monday, the 30th ult., Hon. GEORGE ROBERTSON, for many years a mumber of Congress form Kentucky, delivered a speech at a Bell and Everett mass meeting in Covington. After viewing some of the positions taken by Mr. YAMOBY, Judge ROBERTSON discussed at length the unconstitutionality of accession. While on this subject he said: Can any State break up the Union? Must not the people have power to defend themselves -- to preserve their Government? Can any one member of the Union , becoming discontented or factious, break up the Union? What sort of Government would you call that? All the States are partners in the Union, and could South Carolina by retiring from the Union dissolve the partnership? Does not the Constitution provide that it shall not be altered, changed or amended, but shall be binding on every State and every citizen until three-fourths of the States by their legal representatives shall concur in revoking, changing or amending it? Are we dependent upon the accidental will of an accidental majority in a little State for all the blessings we enjoy under this glorious Constitution? Could South Carolina by blocking her ports affect the commerce of the United States? Could she by blocking her ports paralyze the power of the General Government to regulate commerce? Could she absolve herself from the obligation to pay her portion of the debts of the United States? Gentlemen and ladies, I know this is a dry subject; it is one upon which I would like to dwell, if time and occasion would permit. I know it is dry, and, therefore, I will not labor for the purpose of proving that nullification and secession are both equally unconstitutional. If a State choose to revolt by rebellion, she has a natural right to take notice that when a State or any faction of people revolt, they must take the chances. If they succeed they may be called patriots. If they fall they will be denounced as traitors, and will meet the doom of traitors. [Applause.] Judge ROBERTSON then proceeded to show how this principle was to be applied in the present crisis. He alluded to the nullification troubles in 1853, and charged that there was just as much proof now that Mr. BRECKINRIDGE was a nullifier and seceder as that Mr. YANCEY belonged to that class of politicians. Then speaking of the Norfolk questions, he said: Well , now they talk about DOUGLAS' answer being infamous. They say -- suppose every Southern State, including Kentucky, should secede, would you then, as a Kentuckian, join an Abolition army to force Kentucky to remain in the Union? There is secession that can't be healed. There is revolt that it is hopeless to try to put down. That is not the question. Suppose the people of the other States are opposed to secession, and a particular State shall try to secede. They say it would be wrong to use an army to subdue her. There is the crisis. That is the practical test of the powers of all Government. Moral suasion and advice is generally sufficient, but if that is not sufficient, if they will insist upon rebelling, you must use the proper power. If an army be necessary, it is the duty of the United States to call the army into service. What did Gen. WASHINGTON do? Did not he himself in person, head an army to go to Western Pennsylvania, to put down the whisky insurrection? Were not SITEGREVES and others prosecuted and convicted of treason, but as the thing had passed off, he wisely and prudently pardoned them? But had the same crisis occurred again, Gen. WASHINGTON would have said it is too late now to compromise, if this thing is persisted in, the sooner the experiment as to whether we can maintain the Government is decided, the better for us and our posterity. You will find, I think, if they bring us to that extremity that you hear something about -- treason against the United States -- that the, agitators will find whether there is a Government or the United States that can hang you for treason. I would resort to that extreme remedy if absolutely necessary. What would I do, suppose, for illustration, South Carolina, In the event of LINCOLN's election, should secede? She cannot move her geographical position. Suppose she says she is out of the Union. I say you have no right to go out; but as you say you are out, and will insist upon going out, you are not entitled to the protection of the Constitution of the United States, and you shall not have it. If you don't choose to send members of Congress to Washington, we can get along without them. If you don't choose to invoke the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, we won't press it upon you. As long as you stand out in defiance of the Constitution, you shall practically be treated as if you were out of the Union. If you want the mail, you must get it the best way you can. No mail shall pass the last post-office northwest of your State line. But there is one thing you must do. You must pay duties upon imported goods. To make you do this, I will use no force, but will send to hover round your harbor an American vessel, and whenever it sees a ship from abroad coining towards your port with goods to be unloaded there, not permit it to pass into the port until the duties are paid. That would be an act of aggression -- no war. What could they do? Governor WISE -- General Wiss, that wants to hunt up an army to fight -- who would he fight, where would he fight? How would South Corolina get along? she would have no mail, no representation in Congress, no participation in the Judiciary of the United States, no opportunity to get any goods imported without paying duty. She would, in fact, be starved out. If she should levy an army to send to Washington City, then I would call that treason, and then I would use force. It never would be necessary to resort to that extreme remedy. Here you have a quiet, sure and safe antidote against ultimate secession. I have detained you too long upon this first topic, but it is an important one.  ",

Given the high rates of childhood obesity and children's poor diets, it doesn't make sense to advertise and market unhealthy food to children at all, much less in schools, said Margo Wootan , Center for Science in the Public Interest's nutrition policy director. CSPI says that in 2012, 70 percent of elementary and middle school students and 90 percent of high school students attended schools that allowed food marketing, most of it for unhealthy food.

California banned sodas and junk food from public schools in 2005 and Connecticut did so in 2006, but most states don't have policies.

   "input": "One person 2019s tedium is another person 2019s riveting depth. 201cLondon Spy, 201d a new BBC America miniseries, may remind you of that TV axiom, as the drama creeps forward with the kind of deliberate pace that, as with 201cRectify 201d and 201cBreaking Bad, 201d requires patience. It most certainly rewards you for your focus, as it brings you into a sense of real time with the characters and enables you to see and feel all of what is at stake. A lot is happening in each mesmerizing moment, not action-wise but psychologically. But still, be forewarned, 201cLondon Spy 201d runs a few miles behind fast shows such as 201cEmpire, 201d which are driven to offer at least one major plot twist between every commercial break. OK, now that I 2019ve gotten that caveat out of the way, I can drop some praise on 201cLondon Spy, 201d which premieres on Thursday night at 10. The five-part miniseries is both a rich love story and, as the dull title indicated, a spy drama, with both genres tightly bound up together. Ben Whishaw stars as Danny, a lonely man who works at a big box store, lives in a shabby apartment with friends, and is getting tired of and too old for a life of one-night stands. When he has a chance meeting with handsome investment banker Alex, played by Edward Holcroft, he falls fast. Alex is still in the closet, and, quite unlike Danny, has never acted on his gay attractions. Still, they forge a deep bond, which we watch unfold as if through a microscope. And that 2019s all I 2019m going to say about the story line, which, with some Hitchcockian flair, develops into something unexpected and mysterious. I 2019m not even going to tell you who Charlotte Rampling plays, when she shows up with a chilly wind in episode 2. But I will say that your understanding of the facts of the situation will change with each enigmatic hour. Part of the pleasure of 201cLondon Spy, 201d created and written by Tom Rob Smith, is the way truths about the characters 2014 not just Danny and Alex, but Danny 2019s older gay friend and mentor, Jim Broadbent 2019s Scottie 2014 emerge gradually, elliptically, after you 2019ve been wondering for a while. Very little about the plot is telegraphed ahead of time. Whishaw is extraordinary in this role. The actor, who has played Q in the last two James Bond movies, has done plenty of standout work in recent years, in the TV journalism drama 201cThe Hour 201d and in the movie 201cBright Star 201d as poet John Keats. But I don 2019t think I 2019ve ever seen him quite as raw as he is in 201cLondon Spy, 201d which features some dreamily explicit sex scenes. It 2019s a seamless and seemingly effortless performance, with Whishaw thoroughly immersed in the role, and it 2019s a treat to watch him work dynamic scenes with the formidable Rampling and Broadbent. As Danny, Whishaw is boyish and flip right down to the way he walks. But you can feel the exhaustion in his soul at his rudderless life, before he and Alex 2019s relationship takes off (Whishaw even looks a bit like depressed musician Nick Drake). You can tell, as the show 2019s mystery develops, that his new love has made him finally ready to fight for what he wants. Despite the fact that Danny spent years doing drugs and having random sex, he remains a romantic, which Whishaw conveys with great subtlety. You may or may not struggle with the heightened, heated-up filmmaking in 201cLondon Spy, 201d which is filled with artful camera angles and non-linear time leaps, but you will likely fall under Whishaw 2019s spell. Danny is out to sea as his relationship with Alex ushers him into a challenging and murky new reality. And Smith puts us alongside Danny for the ride, as he fights to find out what is really going on and who is zooming who. Despite governmental bluff and other significant obstacles, Danny refuses to drop out. He doggedly continues to follow the trail of clues and suspicions as they emerge in 201cLondon Spy. 201d I 2019m glad I did the same thing. Starring: Ben Whishaw, Edward Holcroft. Jim Broadbent, Charlotte Rampling, Samantha Spiro. On BBC America, Thursday night, 10-11:15  ",

   "input": "Activision Blizzard Inc. on Thursday turned in a lackluster report for the holiday quarter, which included a rare miss on analyst profit forecasts. Investors punished the company 2019s stock in return. Shares of Activision, which had rallied from around $28 a share in price to near $40 in the final months of last year, tumbled by as much as 18% in after-hours trading on Thursday. In recent trade, the stock price was down 13.5%. Activision reported that adjusted profit fell in the fourth quarter to 83 cents a share from 94 cents a year ago. Analysts had forecast 86 cents, while the company expected 82 cents. The company hasn 2019t missed on analyst per-share profit expectations in about five years, according to Colin Sebastian, an analyst at R.W. Baird & Co. 201cThis market is unforgiving right now, 201d he said. 201cThere 2019s an exaggerated reaction to misses because there 2019s a lot of uncertainty. 201d Along with the profit miss, Activision announced a delay to the sequel of a key game, while results slumped at King Digital Entertainment PLC, the mobile game maker Activision is acquiring. The company had expected adjusted revenue in the fourth quarter, which is the important holiday period, to be flat at $2.15 billion, since it released a similar holiday slate of games a year earlier, including a fresh 201cCall of Duty 201d installment. Instead, adjusted revenue fell roughly 4% to $2.12 billion. Videogame companies, as well as Wall Street, focus on adjusted results because under U.S. accounting rules, revenue for online-enabled games is deferred as long as new content is being added. Meanwhile, the impact of a strong U.S. dollar trimmed $125 million from revenue and 11 cents a share in profit, Activision added. Activision also partly blamed a soft showing from casual games, such as 201cSkylanders SuperChargers, 201d for its subpar fourth quarter. Stores were filled this past Christmas with toys-to-life competitors, such as an 201cInfinity 201d game from Walt Disney Co. featuring 201cStar Wars 201d characters and a new entrant from Lego A S called 201cDimensions 201d that included Batman. Casual players are also shifting to mobile devices, hurting console games such as 201cGuitar Hero Live, 201d the company said. Activision has taken steps to expand beyond its core business of console gaming, including the $5.9 billion acquisition of King, which has one of the world 2019s most successful mobile franchises in 201cCandy Crush. 201d The deal, which is expected to be completed later this month, gives Activision a stronger foothold in the fast-growing mobile-games business. Once completed, Activision said it would have 500 million monthly active users, up from 80 million. But Activision faces challenges in growing King beyond its 201cCandy Crush 201d fame. For the fourth quarter, King on Thursday reported revenue, profit and a user base that were lower than a year earlier. Spending by players in newer games was increasing, but not enough to offset a drop in spending on older games, particularly 201cCandy Crush Saga, 201d King said. King, which will continue to operate as an independent unit under CEO Riccardo Zacconi after the acquisition is final, posted $478 million in adjusted revenue and per-share profit of 38 cents for the holiday quarter. That was down from $559 million and 57 cents a share a year ago. Adjusted bookings tumbled 13% to $509 million. Monthly unique payers fell 21% to 6.58 million. Still, Activision expects a brighter 2016, with adjusted revenue of $6.25 billion and per-share profit of $1.75, well above the $4.62 billion in adjusted revenue and $1.32 in per-share profit earned in 2015. On a conference call with analysts, Chief Executive Bobby Kotick reiterated that Activision views itself as a broad entertainment company. He described its customer base as comparable to that of major social and entertainment giants such as Facebook Inc., ESPN and the National Football League. To illustrate that point, he highlighted the King acquisition and that of 201ce-sports 201d producer and broadcaster Major League Gaming Inc. He said they were key to growing monthly active users as well as the number of hours people spend watching the company 2019s content. Other company executives on the call also talked up the release of 201cOverwatch, 201d a new franchise coming in 2016 that is integral to the company 2019s e-sports expansion. At the same time, though, Activision said it was pushing back a sequel to the smash hit 201cDestiny 201d to 2017. Rising demand for content delivered over the Internet helped boost digital sales to a high for the holiday period, Activision said. For example, the company sold nearly double as many digital downloads of 201cCall of Duty: Black Ops III 201d as it did with the series 2019 prior installment, 201cAdvanced Warfare, 201d released a year earlier. Adjusted digital revenue reached a record $780 million, accounting for a record 37% of total adjusted revenue. Rivals Electronic Arts Inc. and Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. in recent days also reported strong digital revenue, a boon for profit margins. Under generally accepted accounting principles, Activision reported fourth-quarter revenue of $1.35 billion and a profit of 21 cents a share, down from $1.58 billion and 49 cents a share a year earlier.

Police say 38-year-old Cedric Ford drove through two Kansas towns on Thursday, shooting people before opening fire on his own workplace, a Harvey County Sheriff's Office spokesperson tells PEOPLE. He was randomly shooting people , Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton said of the gunman during a news conference on Friday. At around 5 p.m. , officers received a report of a man shot in the shoulder. Soon another report came in, another victim had been shot in the leg, the sheriff's office said in a The shooter proceeded north to Excel Industries in Hesston , where one person was shot in the parking lot before he opened fire inside the building, police said in the statement. He was seen entering the building with a long gun. Source: Cedric Ford Facebook Three people were killed inside the factory.

We're trained for these. Less than two hours before the deadly shooting , the sheriff's office served the shooter with a protection from abuse order at the factory, Walton said. He said the man was upset, but no more than any other person would be when served with such an order. He didn't display anything that was outrageous , Walton said. He was just a little upset. Walton said that the person who had the order of protection out against the shooter was not in the Excel factory. The official did not give details about the circumstances surrounding the order , but said such orders are usually filed due to violence in a relationship. The shooter has a criminal history stretching back to 1996, reports, citing court records. The shooter previously lived in Miami and had a series of convictions in Florida. At the press conference, Walton said, [The shooter has] been in my jail a couple times before.

(AP) A Russian court has sentenced Ukrainian pilot Nadezhda Savchenko to 22 years in jail after finding her guilty of complicity in the killing of two Russian journalists during the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine. Savchenko, a 34-year-old who has become a national hero at home in Ukraine, was defiant as the verdict was read out on Tuesday, shouting out a Ukrainian song and forcing the judge Leonid Stepanenko to call a brief adjournment. Savchenko was captured by pro-Moscow rebels in eastern Ukraine in June 2014 during the separatist conflict there and handed over to Russia where she was charged with directing mortar fire which killed the two Russian journalists. She has denied wrongdoing, and, from the glass and metal cage where she has been held in the courtroom, has often shouted her view that she is the victim of a show trial aimed at humiliating Ukraine. Russian officials have signalled that, once the trial is over, they may be open to negotiations about handing Savchenko over to Ukraine, possibly as part of a prisoner exchange.  ",

At least 65 cases of violence against people with albinism including killings and dismemberment have been recorded by police in Malawi since late 2014, said Ikponwosa Ero, the UN's independent expert on human rights and albinism, on Friday. People with albinism live in danger in regions of the world where their body parts are valued in witchcraft and can fetch a high price. Superstition leads many to believe albino children bring bad luck. In Malawi, where people with albinism number around 10,000 out of a population of around 16.5 million, the situation amounted to an emergency , a crisis disturbing in its proportions , she said. Some of the Malawians with albinism she met compared their ordeal to that of endangered species in the wild, Ero told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a phone interview from Malawi. She said people with albinism are an endangered people group facing a risk of systemic extinction over time if nothing is done. We talk about protecting wildlife while not even prioritising efforts in protecting people with albinism , she said. Ero , who is from Nigeria and has albinism, took the job as the UN's first independent expert on the issue last August. Albinism is a congenital disorder affecting about one in 20,000 people worldwide who lack pigment in their skin, hair and eyes. It is more common, however, in sub-Saharan Africa. Attacks against people with albinism are particularly brutal, at times involving victims being dismembered alive by assailants wielding machetes, Ero said in her first report earlier this year. She said was particularly troubled during her Malawi trip by an encounter with a teenage boy, Alfred. The 17-year-old with albinism had been found in a pool of blood a year ago after being stabbed during his sleep by a machete-wielding attackers. He was silent while meeting her, she said. The boy hadn't recovered and stopped attending school since the attack. You wonder what will become of this person , said Ero.  ",

We're comparing notes because my son [born July 2014] is about a year and a half older than her young son. I'm showing her photos and videos and what to expect. We're just really enjoying each other's company. As with their courtship and subsequent marriage , the private pair had kept news of their growing family under wraps. It's something I realized about the most important things in my life , Kartheiser in 2014 about keeping his lips sealed when it comes to his personal life. If I share them with the world and I open that door to their fuming anger that they need to get out or their adoration that they want to flaunt , it lessens it. It cheapens it; it weakens it. And it's magical, love, and all of that is 00e2 0080 00a6 profoundly spiritual, and it just doesn't feel right. The couple met when Bledel guest starred as the mistress of Pete Campbell (Kartheiser's character) on season 5 of that he kept it completely professional and didn't become romantically involved with Bledel until two months after the season wrapped , but costar said he sensed a connection between the future-spouses long before they made it official. I did know he liked her from a very early point , . I was a supporter of that union. Even show creator Matthew Weiner could feel the love in the air. I told Vinny that they would be great together. I was like , 'Don't blow it!' he told Honestly , they're a really good match, he added. They're both very down to earth , with a sense of responsibility and strong family ties. And they've been acting since before they can remember, which makes for a very special personality. It's not just that I thought they would look cute together. Bledel and Kartheiser finally went public with their relationship at an October 2012 press event. Then in March 2013 , Kartheiser shyly admitted to . Yes , I don't know, yes, he replied when asked if he was getting married. costars stepped in to spill some details on the romance. the actor jokingly practiced popping the question on her and It was purely comedic but he was giving [Elisabeth] and I a facetious rendition of his planned proposal , Par 00e9 said at the season 6 premiere of the show. We were like , 'Great! Lets do this one without cursing and without yelling!' They are such a yin and yang , Moss added about the couple. I've known Vinny for 12 years and Alexis is just the sweetest. I've never seen Vincent like this. It is really cool. The next month , Bledel gave the world a glimpse of her gorgeous octagonal-shaped 2013 secretly, of course 2013 in a June 2014 ceremony in California. Although officially husband and wife, Bledel and Kartheiser didn't make a public appearance together until the January 2016 Screen Actors Guild Awards. The reclusive life is nothing new for Kartheiser, who in 2014 that he tends not to leave his house because, as he put it, there's nothing out there. Although he prefers to stay a healthy distance away from the grid , Kartheiser admitted to that his lifestyle isn't quite as eccentric as he led reporters to believe in his pre-Bledel days. Like , I don't have a toilet at the moment. My house is just a wooden box. I mean I am planning to get a toilet at some point. But for now I have to go to the neighbors. I threw it all out, he told that he has never lived without a toilet , but he does maintain that he lived without a car in L.A. for years, commuting to the I go on the bus , I walk, he told . A friend left his car recently at my house and I took it out one day just for 15 minutes and it was terrible. You know why? I felt like I was back in L.A. again. Four or five years ago , when I had a car and I had been out of the city, I wouldn't feel I was back until I got in the car, you know. But now I feel off the grid. I feel that I am not part of the culture. And because I don't have a car I don't really go anywhere to buy things. But by 2014 , Kratheiser's lady love was already encouraging him to tune down his quirks. I still dress like I did in high school. My fianc 00e9e bought me all of this , he told about his dapper outfit. She's like , 'Honestly, another ripped T-shirt? Put this on.' Now parents , the couple remain comfortable in their private ways, but Kartheiser has seemed to move on from his living in a wooden box phase , and we even got a rare peek of their marital style when their chic Brooklyn Heights recently went on the market.

   "input": "Since the end of the Cold War, nations across Europe have spent relatively little time or money defending their borders from aggressive neighbors. But, as tensions between Russia and the west rise, several nations in the region are boosting defense budgets and eyeing new sophisticated air defense weapons systems. That 2019s set the stage for a showdown between U.S. defense contractors Raytheon RTN and Lockheed Martin LMT , the world 2019s leading makers of missile defense systems capable of knocking incoming airborne threats out of the sky. Over the past decade, any conversation about European missile defense largely centered on a theater missile shield. The shield relies on a series of radar installations and missile batteries installed in Poland and Romania (largely funded by the U.S.) to defend against an Iranian ballistic missile threat. However, as Russia flexes its military might, Baltic and Scandinavian nations 2014as well as countries in central and Western Europe 2014are starting to feel nervous. Most are now shifting their attention away from pan-European missile shields and towards rapidly deployable piecemeal systems that can defend an individual nation 2019s airspace. This type of defense means possibly buying anti-aircraft and anti-missile defense systems, which currently no one in the world does like U.S. defense firms Raytheon and Lockheed Martin, says Roman Schweizer, a defense policy analyst at Guggenheim Securities. 201cMissile defense is one of those categories that 2019s on its own right now, 201d he says. 201cU.S. defense systems are the best, or at least the proven technologies that outdistance the competition in many respects. 201d Heightened interest in missile technology places Raytheon and Lockheed Martin on opposite sides of a marketing battle, which has billions of dollars and decades of contracts hanging in the balance. Such a competition is already playing out in the Middle East and Asia, where perceived threats from North Korea, China, and Iran have pushed neighboring countries to bolster defenses. Since December 2014, Raytheon has piled up $5 billion in Patriot contracts from countries like Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and South Korea. Qatar and Saudi Arabia are also working to acquire Lockheed 2019s Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-ballistic missile system, on which the United Arab Emirates has signed deals totaling $1.9 billion in recent years. But, while tensions in those regions have developed over decades, Russia 2019s diplomatic about-face has been a bit more abrupt and generated a lot of interest in Europe in a short amount of time. Given tightening defense budgets across the globe, options for countries wary of new threats are slim. 201cWe 2019re in an environment of constrained dollars today, and no nation can go it alone, no one can take a blank sheet of paper and design a new weapons system, 201d says Raytheon vice president Tim Glaeser. That makes Europe a ripe market for companies that can offer missile defense systems that are affordable and easy to deploy. 201cEurope could become a growth area, 201d Schweizer says. 201cCertainly Poland and Germany have made two big decisions lately that have been meaningful to Raytheon and Lockheed, and there are plenty of other opportunities. 201d Raytheon sells the Patriot Air and Missile System, an interceptor missile system borne directly out of Cold War tensions with Russia in the 1980s. The Patriot rose to prominence during Operation Desert Storm in the early 1990s and is now deployed across the globe, including with four European militaries and the United States Army. Meanwhile Lockheed Martin 2014the underdog, but by no means the inferior in this competition 2014is aggressively marketing the Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS), its own ground-mobile air defense system. Jointly developed by the United States, Germany, and Italy, MEADS was designed to replace the Patriot, with Lockheed Martin as the prime contractor. In 2011, the U.S. decided not to purchase MEADS and instead upgraded its existing Patriot systems. In December of last year it pulled its support from the 10-year, $3.4 billion MEADS program, placing huge pressure on Lockheed to quickly find a customer for the program or risk shouldering much of the ongoing program costs itself. MEADS suffered another setback earlier this year when Poland, after long considering the system for its air defenses, decided to go with the Patriot in April. However, the program 2019s luck began to change when in June Germany breathed $4 billion worth of new life into MEADS, selecting the system for its own defenses and opening the door to further exports. 201cGermany 2019s was an incredibly significant decision for us, 201d Marty Coyne, MEADS business development manager at Lockheed Martin, told National Defense magazine last month. 201cWhat is significant is that they extended an open invitation to the rest of Europe to come join them. 201d Lockheed 2019s challenge will be convincing other countries already using Patriot to transition to MEADS. A nod of approval from Germany 2014which holds a lot of sway in the European defense community 2014could go a long way towards changing officials 2019 minds. Raytheon, for its part, will continue pressing the case for Patriot and its long track record. Neither company is ceding ground just yet. Coyne has said publicly that Lockheed doesn 2019t believe Poland 2019s business is a lost cause, as the country plans to deploy eight total air defense batteries and its contract with Raytheon only covers two. Raytheon likewise isn 2019t counting out Germany. 201cThe contract won 2019t be awarded until 2016 sometime, 201d says Raytheon 2019s Glaeser about Germany 2019s contract with Lockheed. 201cSo if MEADS stumbles, Patriot will remain in the hunt. 201d The rest of an increasingly wary Europe is still up for grabs.

How can a mayoral candidate do what the last two mayors did: run on a platform of competence 2014 a campaign directed toward everyone, not just pandering to special interests? The answer is easy: the single biggest factor affecting New Yorkers 2019 day-to-day quality of life 2014 whether you 2019re rich, poor or in the middle 2014 is noise. New Yorkers are not happy about it. The noise crisis isn 2019t just anecdotal. Last year, the city logged 2 million complaints on its 311 system. And 10.3% of the calls 2014 208,769 2014 were about noise. That 2019s more than twice the number logged in 2004. Even this understates the case. Many callers and online 201ccomplainers 201d on other topics aren 2019t complaining at all. The city had 50,032 reports of lost property, for example, and tens of thousands of requests for various pamphlets. Plus, a hefty chunk of the tens of thousands of people who complained about construction were probably more upset about construction noise. Noise complainers aren 2019t crazy. As Ed Wendell, president of his block association in Woodhaven, Queens, puts it, few are complaining about the neighbor who has a party once. Nor are people griping about the respectful developer who works within his allotted weekday hours (if there is such a creature). Rather, New Yorkers are upset because they must endure chronic, debilitating noise. And if a noise is loud and persistent enough to bother you, chances are it is illegal under the city 2019s ordinances. On paper, New York strictly regulates decibel levels on everything from bars to trucks. After-hours and weekend construction, especially, must be pretty quiet. What kind of noise are people mad about? The list reads like a Dr. Seuss tale. Before you complain to 311, you can choose from 201cnoise from large party, 201d 201cnoise from neighbor, 201d 201cnoise from street, 201d 201cnoise from dog, 201d 201cnoise from animal other than dog, 201d 201cnoise from factory, 201d 201cnoise from ice cream truck, 201d 201cnoise from garbage truck, 201d 201cnoise from construction 201d (which opens up its own set of decision points) and 201cnoise from bar 201d 2014 among others. But mostly, it depends on where you live. In Woodhaven, it 2019s parties. 201cRepeat offenders 201d hold huge bashes, complete with speakers bigger than human beings, Wendell says. In Park Slope, Carroll Gardens, and Red Hook, Brooklyn, it 2019s incessant tour helicopters, says Craig Hammerman, community board president. (In large part that 2019s because City Councilwoman Gale Brewer got rid of much of the problem on the Upper West Side, so the tours moved.) In Hell 2019s Kitchen and Chelsea (Christine Quinn 2019s stomping ground, and where I live), it 2019s noise from nightclubs, bars, after-hours construction and idling buses. Melody Brooks, who lives on West 53rd Street, endured 24-hour noise 201cas loud as a jet engine 201d from a badly built commercial-ventilating system for two years until recently. In Washington Heights and Hamilton Heights in Manhattan, and Bed-Stuy in Brooklyn, it 2019s street crowds and parked cars thumping music all night. Kevin Campbell, who lives in Bed-Stuy and is active in his block association, says a group of chronic street-corner loiterers keep him up, shouting and playing loud music from parked cars from late afternoon 201ctill after midnight. I have to close the windows, turn the A C up and turn the TV up 201d to have some time to concentrate, Campbell says. He 2019s got two kids 2014 now 4 and 6 2014 who will have trouble studying in such an environment in a couple of years, no matter how good the schools are. Even on the wealthy Upper East Side, residents last week voted down audible crosswalk signals 2014 because, they said, there 2019s enough noise already. So how 2019s the city 2019s response? Not great. To even get a reaction, you 2019ve got to have the time to: * Learn about city laws (to find out what city agency among the Department of Environmental Protection, the Department of Buildings, the NYPD and others is in charge of your noise) * Be home for appointments for decibel readings; * Organize your neighbors (often, today, through social media); * Make friends with your local elected or appointed leaders; * Go to meetings that last for hours in order to discourage people who aren 2019t going to such a meeting because they 2019re paid special-interest advocates; * Have good luck, because invariably, inspectors will come out on the one night your neighbor is taking a rest; * And if you meet with success, then make sure, over months and years, that the city government keeps doing it was supposed to be doing already. There 2019s lots New York could do better. To start with, take some of the burden off the police. As the NYPD 2019s community-affairs officers know, the police department is bombarded with complaints about everything 2014 including noise that doesn 2019t fall in their jurisdiction (they mainly do parties). How to do that? Better civil enforcement 2014 with the main focus on stopping the illegal behavior, not charging a fine for it. Suffering New Yorkers aren 2019t interested in being revenue collectors for the city; they want the noise to stop. That means if you were dumb enough to hire architects who designed a ventilation shaft that exceeds legal decibel levels, that should be your bad luck. You should have to turn it off before you think up a fix 2014 rather than torment your neighbors for two years. The rest of us aren 2019t allowed to keep breaking the law until we figure out a way to fit abiding by the law into our lifestyle. The city 2019s civil agencies also should be preventative 2014 not reactive. Remember the bad old days, when NYPD officers only responded to crimes, rather than stop them? Noise-law enforcement is still like that. But city agencies whose officials have time to dun homeowners for improperly sorting their garbage surely have some time to prevent some noises. The biggest obstacle, though, is political will 2014 the same kind that Rudy Giuliani needed two decades ago when he dramatically cut violent crime after people said it couldn 2019t be done. And it requires thinking about New York 2019s long-term interests, rather than short-term interests. Mayor Bloomberg, for example, wants more people to live in mixed-use neighborhoods like the Far West Side 2014 with commercial, residential and office buildings all lumped together. That only works if each party follows the law 2014 and people only follow the law when they have to. Of course, in the short term, a builder or a bar owner wants to make lots of noise. Following the law costs time and money. In the long-term, though, illegal noise drives away committed residents, especially families. The person brave enough to demonstrate that he or she understands that would tap a rich vein of votes. Even before that, though, the current mayor could make noise his latest public-health enemy. He 2019d hear thunderous applause. Nicole Gelinas (@nicolegelinas on Twitter) is a contributing editor to the Manhattan Institute 2019s City Journal.  ",

   "input": "IT would be a rare and perhaps foolish person who would serve on a co-op or condo board that wasn't protected by a directors and officers (D & O) insurance policy. But even savvy board members, insurance experts say, may be unaware of significant variations in coverage. Not all D & O policies are created equal , said Joel Meskin , vice president for community association products of McGowan & Company, an insurance brokerage based in Fairview Park, Ohio. And since we want the best people to sit on co-op and condo boards , we have to make sure we're providing them with the best coverage possible. Mr. Meskin said that co-ops and condos typically have two types of insurance: general liability coverage , which protects the co-op or condo association in the event someone is injured on the property, and D & O coverage, which protects board members and others against claims for wrongful acts. While most D & O policies provide $1 million in coverage 0097 with some buildings supplementing that with an umbrella policy for as much as $100 million 0097 the scope of the coverage is at least as important as the amount. Some D & O policies , Mr. Meskin said, do not provide board members with coverage for contractual claims made by third parties. In other words, he said, if a fuel-oil company successfully sues individual board members for breach of contract, policies that do not explicitly cover such claims will not provide protection. It is also possible that a D & O policy will not provide coverage for things like libel, slander and invasion of privacy. We're seeing increasing numbers of claims based on comments made in e-mails sent between board members , Mr. Meskin said. Andrew Schutzman , president of AMS Risk Management and Consulting in Rockville Centre, N.Y., said that board members should also verify the type of coverage they have for fraud or other dishonesty. He said that while most policies do not provide coverage for damages awarded as a result of a board member's fraud or other dishonesty, there are differences among policies regarding paying for a defense. Providing a defense is the most important coverage you're going to get from a D & O policy , he said. He noted that with some policies , the insurance company will provide a defense until there is clear proof of fraud or dishonesty. But with others, the company can deny a defense based on an allegation of fraud. Boards have to make sure that their D & O policy will provide a defense until there is proof of fraud or dishonesty , he said. Robert Mackoul , president of Mackoul & Associates in Long Beach, N.Y., said that in addition to the coverage provided by a D & O policy, boards should pay attention to who is covered. The better policies are going to cover past and present board members , the corporation or association, volunteers, committee members and even property managers, Mr. Mackoul said. Narrowly drawn policies will cover only the board itself. Boards , he said, should also be aware of limitations on claims. Some policies cover only claims for acts that occurred no more than a year or two in the past. Quality D & O policies don't have such a limitation , he said , noting that such coverage is typically provided only if the board had no knowledge of potential claims when it bought the policy. One indication that a board's D & O coverage is less than adequate, he said, is when the coverage is part of the building's general liability policy. Imbedded D & O coverage is going to be inexpensive but not very comprehensive , he said , explaining that such coverage may cost as little as $100 or $200 a year. A separate but comprehensive policy, Mr. Mackoul said, costs $1,000 to $2,500, depending on building size. When you consider the stakes , he said , that's money well spent.  ",

   "input": "At Oracle OpenWorld this week, company execs spent a good chunk of their stage time talking about security. Executive chairman Larry Ellison, for example, extolled the security virtues of Oracle 2019 s ORCL new M7 microprocessor, which he said bakes software security features from the latest release of its Oracle database right into the silicon. Ellison mentioned several times that security problems arise because customers either do not enable the software 2019s security features or intentionally switch them off. That ability, however, will not be an option with the M7 since 201cwe turn it on and you can 2019t turn it off, 201d he told show attendees. The remarks come just weeks after Oracle, ORCL which had no comment on this story, released an eyebrow-raising set of 154 security fixes in a Critical Patch Update covering many of its key products. It is particularly important with this update that customers implement right away because the update includes 201ca number of fixes for very severe vulnerabilities, 201d according to a blog post about the update. An IT consultant who works with federal agencies on Oracle implementations said this update was nothing short of a scandal because Oracle 2019s 201centire product fleet was affected: pretty much every database, middleware web and app server. Everything, 201d said the specialist who requested anonymity because he works with the company 2019s customers. Some of the vulnerabilities could give 200buncredentialed 200b hackers the ability to remotely execute operations. In theory, that means a random-but-code-savvy Joe Shmoe with access to the Internet could run database queries on your business system, or even change data values. 201cThat 2019s bad, 201d the consultant said. The gnarly issue of patching software is not unique to Oracle, but because the company has made a point of calling its own products 201cunbreakable, 201d it pretty much put a bullseye on its own back. Hackers love a good challenge after all. Gartner IT research director Lawrence Pingree said technology providers have to issue patches promptly to keep customers safer from data breaches. 201cIt is quite well known in the security industry that one of the best ways to avoid a data breach is to simply make sure you are deploying patches quickly, 201d he said via email. But, although patch updates are standard operating procedure, Oracle is in the spotlight because so many customers use the company 2019s databases and financial applications to run their businesses, which leaves little room for tolerance or error. We 2019re not talking about Candy Crush here. It also doesn 2019t help that many corporate customers have come to resent Oracle 2019s technical support and maintenance fees. If you 2019re paying 22% of your license cost to stay supported, you have high expectations when it comes to security. Meanwhile, it probably did not help Oracle 2019s relationships when in August Mary Ann Davidson, Oracle 2019s chief security officer, took to her blog to chastise corporate customers for performing their own security tests on company software. In the post she even noted that such tests could violate their licensing agreements. The blog was quickly pulled down and Oracle backed away from her claims. Never ones to let a good crisis go to waste, tech companies are using these security woes to push customers to move to what they 2019re painting as cloud Nirvana. As Oracle CEO Mark Hurd stressed during his keynote, most enterprise applications are now 20 years old 2014that 2019s a lot of legacy code that needs to be maintained, bolstered, and updated. Oracle 2019s new pitch is for customers to move to the cloud 2014Oracle 2019s cloud of course. 201cWe are fully patched, fully secured, fully encrypted, 201d Hurd noted.

If you 2019re in Sweden, that 2019s not OK, according to a ruling against Wikimedia. Wikimedia Sweden, part of the same organization that publishes Wikipedia, claimed Monday 2019s ruling undermines the 201cfreedom of panorama 201d that allows people to capture and share the beauty of public spaces. The Swedish visual copyright society (BUS) disagreed, saying the ruling was 201cimportant for visual artists who need payment for their work. 201d Get Data Sheet, Fortune 2019s technology newsletter. At the heart of the matter is Wikimedia Sweden 2019s location-based database of works of art that are permanently located in public places. Wikimedia argued that this database of images was noncommercial, and Swedish copyright law allows people to take pictures of public art and put them online. The key question that the Swedish supreme court had to address was that of whether the artists behind those works should be able to restrict how those images are shared online. Yes, the court said, they should. The court said the database had a commercial value and, while individuals can take photos of public artworks as they wish, this kind of operation was a different matter. 201cThis is about who decides over the artists 2019 works: the artists themselves or the big players on the Internet, 201d said BUS chairman 00c5sa Berndtsson. 201cThe background to the legal dispute is that Wikimedia has refused to sign a licensing agreement with [BUS] for artists 2019 rights 2014an agreement that would cost just a few hundred euros a year. Rather than negotiating on payments to artists, Wikimedia has instead chosen to spend tens of thousands of euros on lawyers to avoid it. 201d For more on copyright, watch: 201cThe Wikimedia Foundation respects artists 2019 rights to control their works, but artists who wish to control all images of their art have the option to place their works in private places, 201d Wikimedia said. 201cThe public should be free to enjoy and share views of public monuments and landscapes. 201d The ruling comes in the context of a wider European debate over the 201cfreedom of panorama. 201d Different EU countries have different laws on the matter 2014in France, for example, photographers are supposed to ask permission from artists and architects before shooting their public artworks and buildings, while those in Germany and the U.K. can snap away as they please. Jean-Marie Cavada, a French liberal member of the European Parliament, last year tried and failed to whip up a call for the freedom to be removed across the EU. Meanwhile, the European Commission wants to harmonize copyright rules across the bloc, and is currently running a consultation on the freedom of panorama.

CEO's Pitch: The Web of Fate semantic analysis engine can visualize and uncover hidden relationships among historical, present and future events allowing people to: - Study the flow of events and decision paths chosen by historical figures. - Take snapshots of the exact state of when a predictive event is made. So future generations can understand why certain choices were made. - Identify trends, locate anomalies, detect threats and track multiple alternate futures with FutureGraph. Web of Fate also provides semantic web services, allowing users to integrate semantic and decision analysis into their own products and services. Mashable's Take: On the one hand, Arizona-based Web of Fate, a public beta starting today, sees itself as a 201csemantic analysis engine. 201d Pay a visit to the service 2019s homepage, though, and you 2019ll see the phrases 201csocial experiment, 201d 201ccollective intelligence, 201d and 201cuncover hidden relationships among future events. 201d This mix of keywords might seem peculiar, yes?

In fact, if you spend enough time digging beneath the surface, it proves to be a very interesting place to browse and perhaps even contribute to. Leaving aside the service 2019s odd front page dressing (the ethereal graphic shown below the options tabs at the top of the page appears corporate and unnecessary), Web of Fate 2019s primary device 2014 the column where predictions, goals, time capsules (a blank page at the moment), and quotes are all displayed in linear fashion 2014 is something that 2019s admittedly entertaining to peruse. It 2019s simple and intuitive to understand. Users write headlines for things they foresee happening in the future, be it a newsworthy event or a personal goal or whathaveyou, and those things show up for users to agree or disagree with, comment on, or challenge. It has clearly been influenced by the type of structure popularized by Digg. Only, this one has a focus on the days weeks months years ahead, rather than the present. The site 2019s features operate quite well. Links take you where you need to go. No major surprises. If you 2019d like, you can choose to see entries mapped out in a cloud-like visualization, where floating points of various sizes are all connected to to be viewed as a literal Web of links. Most users, however, will presumably stick to the site 2019s main components. And my sense is that registered users will be quite pleased with what they 2019re offered. Given enough members, this place could become a real hotbed for forecasters. If nothing else, Web of Fate is well built to spark substantial discussion and debate about the course of world events.

   "input": "San Francisco is to have a second chance to vote on whether to tax soda after city officials this week added the measure to a November ballot that could expand the hotly-debated levy deeper into the Bay Area. The move follows the city 2019s legal victory last month against the soda industry, which tried to halt its effort to introduce warnings on advertisements for beverages with added sugar noting that they contribute to obesity, diabetes and tooth decay. It will be the first U.S. city to introduce the labeling, due to come into effect next month. A vote in favor of a San Francisco soda tax could add further strength to national moves to deter consumption of the sugary drinks, which have parallels with efforts to reduce tobacco consumption. The ballot initiative comes almost two years after an earlier measure was unsuccessful and raises the prospect the tax will spread beyond nearby Berkeley, California, to much of the Bay Area 2019s northern region, which economists say could heighten the policy 2019s effectiveness. Covering a broader area could alleviate a key concern about the success of soda taxes: that they can be undermined by cross-border shopping. In Berkeley, some research has suggested businesses did not fully pass along the tax for fear of losing customers to stores in neighboring cities. The addition of the levy to the ballot on Tuesday came the day after Philadelphia 2019s mayor signed a sweet beverage levy, making the city the largest in the nation with an ounce-based tax on sweet drinks. An increasing number of U.S. government officials and nutritionists have proposed excise taxes on sugary beverages as a way to combat rising rates of obesity, diabetes and other health epidemics. In a statement, the California Beverage Association said it was 201cmisleading to single out any single food, beverage or ingredient 201d in addressing these complex problems. Two Berkeley neighbors 2014Oakland and Albany, Calif. 2014will also vote in November on a soda tax. If the measures there and in San Francisco are successful, the sugary beverage tax would expand to a population of over 1.4 million in the Bay Area. Should the taxes be approved in San Francisco and Oakland, two large cities with vastly different demographics, the cause could gain significant nationwide momentum, said Larry Tramutola, a California political strategist who is organizing both cities 2019 campaigns. 201cWhat this is going to say is this is more of a national issue, 201d Tramutola said. 201cThere 2019s a very good chance both of these pass, and if they do it blows a major hole in the industry defensive. 201d Early evidence from Berkeley and Mexico, which implemented a nationwide tax in 2014, shows that costs are passed on to varying degrees. If the costs do not cause retail price hikes, consumption may fall by less than health advocates hope. Similar measures are being considered elsewhere in the United States and in other countries. Interviews with over a dozen economists, researchers and grocers suggest that municipal taxes like that of Philadelphia may be vulnerable to cross-border shopping. When it comes to soda taxes, the bigger the area, the more the measure reduces consumption, some said. 201cYou 2019re more likely to have higher pass-through if a larger chunk of your business is affected, 201d said Jennifer Falbe, a researcher with the University of California-Berkeley 2019s School of Public Health who found 47 percent of the tax was passed on to the city 2019s consumers in the first few months after implementation. That is less than in Mexico, where researchers have found a similar tax was passed on and hurt demand. Others questioned the extent to which people cross borders for small-ticket items like soda. If neighboring Oakland and Albany pass the tax, that question could be less relevant for Berkeley. 201cImagine all the counties in the Bay Area passed soda taxes. How many people are really going to Gilroy to buy sodas? 201d said Jeffrey Grogger, a University of Chicago economist who has studied Mexico 2019s soda tax, referring to a city over 70 miles away.

In a recent YouTube video, posted July 10, he praised the killing of the Dallas officers and said, It's justice. Dabadie said he believes the shooter would have kept killing had he not been killed himself. This guy was going to another location and he was not going to stop here. I have no doubt he was heading to [police] headquarters , he said. (The shooting took place less than 1 mile from police headquarters.) The shooter was killed by a SWAT team sniper from 100 yards away , authorities said. The shot our SWAT team made was a hell of a shot , Dabadie said.

   "input": "For many of us, the most pressing question about exercise is: How little can I get away with? The answer, according to a sophisticated new study of interval training, may be very, very little. In this new experiment, in fact, 60 seconds of strenuous exertion proved to be as successful at improving health and fitness as three-quarters of an hour of moderate exercise. Let me repeat that finding: One minute of arduous exercise was comparable in its physiological effects to 45 minutes of gentler sweating. I have been writing for some time about the potential benefits of high-intensity interval training, a type of workout that consists of an extremely draining but brief burst of exercise 2014 essentially, a sprint 2014 followed by light exercise such as jogging or resting, then another sprint, more rest, and so on. Athletes rely on intervals to improve their speed and power, but generally as part of a broader, weekly training program that also includes prolonged, less-intense workouts, such as long runs. But in the past few years, exercise scientists and many of the rest of us have become intrigued by the idea of exercising exclusively with intervals, ditching long workouts altogether. The allure of this approach is obvious. Interval sessions can be short, making them a boon for anyone who feels that he or she never has enough time to exercise. Previously, I have written about a number of different interval programs, involving anywhere from 10 minutes of exhausting intervals in a single session to seven minutes, six, four and even fewer. Each program had scientific backing. But because of time and funding constraints, most studies of interval training have had limits, such as not including a control group, being of short duration or studying only health or fitness results, not both. Consequently, fundamental questions have remained unanswered about just how well these very short, very intense workouts really stack up against traditional, endurance-style training. So scientists at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, who had themselves conducted many of those earlier studies of interval training, decided recently to mount probably the most scientifically rigorous comparison to date of super-short and more-standard workouts. They began by recruiting 25 out-of-shape young men and measuring their current aerobic fitness and, as a marker of general health, their body 2019s ability to use insulin properly to regulate blood sugar levels. The scientists also biopsied the men 2019s muscles to examine how well their muscles functioned at a cellular level. Then the researchers randomly divided the men into three groups. (The scientists plan to study women in subsequent experiments.) One group was asked to change nothing about their current, virtually nonexistent exercise routines; they would be the controls. A second group began a typical endurance-workout routine, consisting of riding at a moderate pace on a stationary bicycle at the lab for 45 minutes, with a two-minute warm-up and three-minute cool down. The final group was assigned to interval training, using the most abbreviated workout yet to have shown benefits. Specifically, the volunteers warmed up for two minutes on stationary bicycles, then pedaled as hard as possible for 20 seconds; rode at a very slow pace for two minutes, sprinted all-out again for 20 seconds; recovered with slow riding for another two minutes; pedaled all-out for a final 20 seconds; then cooled down for three minutes. The entire workout lasted 10 minutes, with only one minute of that time being strenuous. Both groups of exercising volunteers completed three sessions each week for 12 weeks, a period of time that is about twice as long as in most past studies of interval training. By the end of the study, published in PLOS One, the endurance group had ridden for 27 hours, while the interval group had ridden for six hours, with only 36 minutes of that time being strenuous. But when the scientists retested the men 2019s aerobic fitness, muscles and blood-sugar control now, they found that the exercisers showed virtually identical gains, whether they had completed the long endurance workouts or the short, grueling intervals. In both groups, endurance had increased by nearly 20 percent, insulin resistance likewise had improved significantly, and there were significant increases in the number and function of certain microscopic structures in the men 2019s muscles that are related to energy production and oxygen consumption. There were no changes in health or fitness evident in the control group. The upshot of these results is that three months of concerted endurance or interval exercise can notably 2014 and almost identically 2014 improve someone 2019s fitness and health. Neither approach to exercise was, however, superior to the other, except that one was shorter 2014 much, much shorter. Is that reason enough for people who currently exercise moderately or not at all to begin interval training as their only workout? 201cIt depends on who you are and why you exercise, 201d said Martin Gibala, a professor of kinesiology at McMaster University who oversaw the new study. 201cIf you are an elite athlete, then obviously incorporating both endurance and interval training into an overall program maximizes performance. But if you are someone, like me, who just wants to boost health and fitness and you don 2019t have 45 minutes or an hour to work out, our data show that you can get big benefits from even a single minute of intense exercise. 201d Interested in running?

   "input": "Traditional British food has long had its detractors and its defenders. In a 1945 essay published in the Evening Standard, George Orwell, firmly in the latter camp, made a persuasive case on behalf of his national cuisine. Even he conceded, though, that the country 2019s best restaurants served foreign food. 201cIt is a fact that restaurants which are distinctively English and which also sell good food are very hard to find, 201d Orwell lamented. While much has changed today, with chefs like Fergus Henderson and Jason Atherton giving modern relevance to once-tired British fare, many of the city 2019s top-rated establishments continue to embrace international cuisine, reflective of the capital 2019s cosmopolitan makeup. In London, a few traditional British stalwarts remain: The city 2019s oldest restaurants still devote themselves to ye olde steak and kidney pies, fish and chips, bubble and squeak and other off-puttingly named fare. They 2019ve been expertly turning out the same venerable dishes 2014or near enough 2014for more than a century, despite being overshadowed by this or that gastronomic wunderkind or bratty fusion upstart. Now, with the Brexit vote behind us and a tide of Britishness sweeping the nation, it seemed like a good time to drop in on London 2019s august culinary institutions. I went to four of the oldest, excluding pubs; though some are much older (a few date to the 1400s), beer, I reasoned, is their bread and butter. Instead, I went in search of that fine English cooking Orwell so patriotically defended, served in dining rooms bearing the patina of a lost era. When I mentioned my mission to a barber in the trendy Shoreditch neighborhood, he laughed. 201cYeah, the English cling to their British food, 201d he said, 201cbut it 2019s comical since one of the most popular dishes here is chicken tikka masala. 201d Though Rules has laid claim to the 201coldest restaurant 201d moniker, Simpson 2019s Tavern, across from the Royal Exchange, precedes it by 41 years. 201cThe main difference between a tavern and a restaurant is that in the past, the former offered only a set menu 2014tavern diners ate what was presented to them; restaurants offered you a choice 2014and patrons usually sat at communal tables, 201d explained food historian Annie Gray. Simpson 2019s no longer has fixed courses, but you 2019ll still find wood-paneled communal booths and a homey conviviality. I was seated next to an insurance underwriter named Jeff Alexander, who assured me that lunch here was a rite of passage in the insurance market. (The restaurant is open only for lunch.) Classic English fare like smoked mackerel, pork belly with crackling and English mustard dressing, roasts and lamb shanks came up from the basement via dumbwaiters and was doled out by the no-nonsense staff, as were copious glasses of port and beer. I ordered a hearty beef and ale pie with mashed potatoes. After instructing me in the proper way to consume 201cstewed cheese 201d (a molten concoction served with white bread, Worcestershire sauce, mustard and cayenne pepper), Mr. Alexander thanked the staff by name, and left a cash tip. 201cThey have been known in years past to chase you down the alley if you haven 2019t left enough cash, 201d he cautioned. I left a 00a35 note for the $26 meal and was off, utterly stuffed. simpsonstavern.co.uk Thomas Rule, the son of a fishmonger, opened Rules in Covent Garden in 1798, and it has remained there ever since. The restaurant specializes in wild game and grass-fed Belted Galloway cattle, and prices aren 2019t cheap (entrees average about $39). It 2019s the sort of place that 2019s best experienced when someone else is paying. Over the years, the aesthetic hasn 2019t changed much: The two main dining rooms are chockablock with red velvet, dark wood, vintage prints and paintings and enough mounted taxidermy to put the Bates Motel to shame. 201dWe run along the lines of an English country house, 201d said managing director Ricky McMenemy. 201cIn your home you gather clutter as the years go on. 201d So vividly does the d 00e9cor recall an earlier age that 201dDownton Abbey 201d 201cwas happy to use us, 201d added Mr. McMenemy, referring to the period-drama 2019s decision to set several scenes at Rules. Not surprisingly, given Rules 2019 star turn, some locals grouse that the restaurant has become too touristy, a charge Mr. McMenemy refutes, estimating that only about 20% of its business comes from out-of-towners. Regulars recommend you visit in mid-August to mid-December, during game-hunting season, when you 2019ll find uncommon birds like teal and snipe on the menu. But on a rainy day earlier this month, the steak and kidney pie in an airy pastry crust with tangy gravy (practically dainty compared with Simpson 2019s Tavern 2019s offering, yet double the price, at $19) hit the spot. rules.co.uk Slightly more upscale than Simpson 2019s Tavern, another financial-district institution that 2019s only open for lunch, Sweetings doesn 2019t take advance bookings and seats most customers at one of the several counters around the restaurant. I arrived late in the lunch hour (lucky to get a seat, I was told, as bankers typically pack the place on weekdays) and struck up a conversation with an older gentlemen sitting next to me at the counter 2014Michael McMahon, a retired fruit and vegetable vendor who used to supply the restaurant but hadn 2019t eaten there in about 20 years. 201cThis school-dinner-type operation is very popular in the City, 201d said Mr. McMahon. 201cThat 2019s because most of the City boys come from what we call a public school [a 2018private school 2019 to Americans], where they sat for meals at a counter. 201d The menu features an extensive variety of fresh fish and shellfish. I ordered the massive yet delicate skate wing, fried with herbs and a black butter sauce (about $28), supplementing it with classic English sides like samphire (called sea beans in the U.S.). When I asked my waitress, Lee Marshall, now in her 16th year at the restaurant, to explain another side dish, bubble and squeak, she said, 201cIt 2019s what your mother would make with last night 2019s leftovers but we make fresh every day. 201d The Sweetings version is a crispy croquette of mashed potatoes and cabbage. Angelo Rojo, a waiter with a thick Spanish accent who will soon celebrate 30 years at Sweetings, said not much about the place has changed. 201cBut it 2019s Brexit now. I 2019m waiting to be deported! 201d he joked. 201cOr maybe I 2019ll go to Scotland. 201d sweetingsrestaurant.co.uk Approaching its 275th anniversary next year, Wiltons, not far from Buckingham Palace, began as an oyster and shellfish stall in Haymarket and moved to its current location in 1984. 201cToday, Wiltons feels completely apart from the London dining scene, with its soft carpets, conspiratorial booths, even a carving trolley, 201d said Richard Godwin, author of 201cThe Spirits: A Guide to Modern Cocktailing. 201d 201cThe cooking is good, but it 2019s served with a certain upper-class disdain. 201d After my $98 lunch of half a dozen of the largest briny oysters I 2019ve ever seen; crab with chopped egg and a piquant anchovy aioli; a small salad; and a plate of chewy smoked eel served with horseradish cream and lemon, I spoke with restaurant director Jason Phillips.

   "input": "Researchers had previously shown that colonoscopies, which look for and remove tumors and suspicious precancerous lumps in the intestines, could reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer. But they didn 2019t know for certain that the procedure would save lives. Now they have evidence that it does. A study published in the latest issue of The New England Journal of Medicine that tracked 2,600 patients for as long as two decades found that the test cut the death rate in half, a very substantial reduction. That should reassure millions of Americans who have undergone colonoscopies that the test was worth the unpleasant preparations. And it ought to goad millions who are still ducking the tests to get over their squeamishness. There are several ways to detect colorectal cancers and precancerous growths that are recommended by doctors and expert groups. Some patients send stool samples to a laboratory to look for tell-tale traces of blood, preferably on an annual basis. Others get sigmoidoscopies, which examine the lower part of the colon, or more often colonoscopies, which examine the whole colon and are thought to be more reliable. If nothing is found by the colonoscopy, the patient need not return for 10 years. People with polyps snipped out are advised to get retested in three years. Unfortunately, too few people get any of the recommended screenings. The Government Accountability Office found that only a quarter of all Medicare beneficiaries ages 65 to 75 had undergone any of the recommended screenings from 2005 to 2009. And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Cancer Institute found that only 58.6 percent of men and women between the ages of 50 and 74 got screened in 2010, far short of the national goal of 70.5 percent. There is little that can be done to make colonoscopies more pleasant. To the extent that cost is a barrier for some people (the procedure can cost hundreds or thousands of dollars), the new health care reforms will greatly expand the number of people who can get colonoscopies and other proven preventive services without paying anything out of pocket. That is more good news. A version of this editorial appears in print on February 25,2012, on page A18 of the New York edition with the headline: A Test in Time. Today's Paper,Subscribe  ",

   "input": "Jimmy Nelson spent his early days in Nigeria 2014his father was a geologist for Shell 2014and his adolescence at a Jesuit boarding school in northern England. He was 16 when he contracted cerebral malaria while visiting his parents in Africa, but when he returned to school he was 201ctreated 201d with the wrong medicine. The next morning, his hair had fallen out. Two years later, tired of living like an outcast 2014he 2019d had enough of being judged by his appearance 2014he fled to where bald heads were not only accepted, but seemingly the norm. By then, he had also found photography. Nelson landed in Tibet and began eking out a living by shooting editorial work, mainly in warzones and poverty-stricken corners of the world. Five years later, he had switched to commercial photography 2014advertising was a specialty 2014to support a wife and three kids. That was all well and good until five years ago, when the one-two punch of the global financial meltdown and the industry 2019s preference of digital photography over film put a dent in his ability to provide for his family. Friends and colleagues began to offer advice. You have to go back to the source, they 2019d say. You have to go back to your passion. Fast-forward to today. At 45, Nelson is about to release Before They Pass Away, a massive book 2014both physically and thematically 2014that 2019s the result of three-and-a-half years spent documenting vanishing cultures. In what is perhaps the most comprehensive contemporary look at some of the world 2019s last remaining tribes, the book chronicles Nelson 2019s experiences photographing 35 populations that have neither adapted to the modern world, nor shown a desire to join it. Spending up to two weeks with each culture, Nelson would locate, meet, connect with and photograph these 201clast of the untouched. 201d After a guide or translator made an initial introduction, Nelson would step in to begin forming a bond and eventually get people to pose 2014in the jungle, on a mountaintop, in a river. Using the 4 00d75 plate camera, always in soft light, didn 2019t just slow him down and focus his concentration; it enabled him to directly confront his subjects. He would always be positioned lower than they were, and they would be seated or standing higher, above him, like icons. Getting them to remain still for a four-to-five-second shutter was a feat in itself. And stripping himself of his own modern-day arrogance and colonialist nature came with time. His experience in Ethiopia with the Banna is a good example. The tribesmen were high on khat, he recalls, and holding Kalashnikovs. His way of getting close was by getting small. 201cYou become inferior and you let them push you around; you do not show fear, but you show vulnerability and insecurity, 201d he says. After that, he would befriend who he felt was the most empathetic one, warm up to him, praise him, bank on his vanity. Once that tribesman had his picture taken, making him feel good and big and strong, everyone wanted their picture taken. And on it went with, among others, the Samburu in Kenya and the Maasai in Tanzania, the Gauchos in Argentina and the Huaorani in Ecuador, the Nenets of Russia and the Tsaatan of Mongolia. Each location was picked for its geographic remoteness and each tribe selected for its authenticity, rather than its anthropologic vulnerability. (Three regions were purposefully not included: Australia, due to ingrained cultural problems between modern citizens and the aborigines; West Africa, since al-Qaeda-linked militants were running rampant in Mali; and North America where, Nelson says, the tribes haven 2019t fully retained their heritage the way others have.) The idea of the book, meanwhile, isn 2019t just to show photography, but to create a discussion about the imbalance Nelson sees in the world. 201cWe 2019re out of context, 201d he says. That doesn 2019t mean we should reset to tribal living, but instead create a dialog with the last of the authentics to see where we went wrong; to learn from the purest source what they 2019re doing right and to take that with us into the future. Nelson doesn 2019t want them to end up as we have, and so he plans to revisit each tribe to start that conversation. Jimmy Nelson is an Amsterdam-based photographer focused on disappearing cultures.

   "input": " 201cSometimes I wish I 2019d never done it, 201d Mrs Hamdy told The Telegraph, in her only interview to mark the occasion. Hers is a voice that has been rarely heard: the family of the young man, Mohammed Bouazizi, became unwilling celebrities in the weeks after his lingering death, but a nervous regime arrested Mrs Hamdy when the protests began. By the time she was acquitted of all charges and released, President Zine el-Abedine Ben Ali had fallen, and media attention was focused on Egypt, Libya and Syria. 201cI feel responsible for everything, 201d she went on. Her voice was shaky as she spoke of the traumatic consequences, five years that have transformed the Middle East but seemingly changed very little in poor, provincial towns like Sidi Bouzeid. 201cSometimes, I blame myself and say it is all because of me. I made history since I was the one who was there and my action contributed to it but look at us now. Meanwhile, Tunisians are suffering as always. 201d Mohammed Bouazizi 2019s death triggered some deep nerve in the Arab world. Many myths were told about his own story and that of Mrs Hamdy, as there were about the nature of subsequent uprisings and downfalls, but there remains a basic truth underlying his experience and that of many others. Demonstrators turn over a burned out car after reclaiming the side streets near Tahrir Square Photo: Julian Simmonds The Telegraph Corruption, stifling bureaucracy, and repressive police states were holding back a largely youthful population across the region, and their victims had little way to make their frustrations felt other than extreme actions. Subsequent studies found that self-immolation had already become a common act in Tunisia, accounting already for 15 per cent of all burns cases in Tunis hospitals. Within six months, more than 100 Tunisians had followed suit, and scores more around the Arab world, from Morocco to Saudi Arabia and Iraq, had also set themselves on fire. Still, not many observers could have imagined the chaos that would ensue, even when Mr Ben Ali gave way to weeks of protest and boarded a plane for Saudi Arabia with his wife and a large chunk of the country 2019s gold reserves. Next Hosni Mubarak of Egypt went, after 18 days of telegenic demonstrations in Cairo 2019s Tahrir Square. Then Col Muammar Gaddafi was forced out, after protests turned into civil war and then international war, with the West 2019s air forces joining in. By the time he was bayoneted and shot in October 2011, Syria was in flames, and the West was starting to vacillate about its role, with effects that can still be seen today. Libya, Syria and much of Iraq remain failed states. Egypt is on the brink. In the process a social uprising had turned into a conflict between Islamism, part peaceful, part violent, and secular governments and politicians; and then between religious sects, as Sunni and Shia turned on each other. Despite Mrs Hamdy 2019s despair at the poverty that remains in Tunisia, the country is still seen as the sole success. It has had two general elections in the years since, with a moderate Islamist party, Ennahda, winning the first, before stepping into opposition in the face of an alliance between secular parties that included members of the former regime last year. When I look at the region and my country , I regret it all. Death everywhere and extremism blooming, and killing beautiful souls Much of that is down to a deal negotiated by Rached Ghannouchi , Ennahda 2019s head, who agreed to give up power despite the party 2019s electoral strength. He told The Telegraph this week that he and his colleagues had decided to compromise after considering fundamental issues of what democracy meant. 201cMajoritarian rule, 50 per cent of the vote, is not sufficient, 201d he said. He said he had always known, from the start of Tunisia 2019s political 201ctransition 201d, that he would have to seek alliances, and in the first government Ennahda ruled alongside a centre-left secular party. 201cWe thought having a government with a majority would be enough, 201d he said. 201cThen we realised we needed more: we needed consensus. 201d The difference between Tunisia and Egypt here is stark. While, as he points out, Egypt, Syria and Iraq are all more complex and difficult countries than Tunisia, the fact remains that Ennahda downplayed Islamist demands when the country drew up a constitution, the resulting document winning 94 per cent of the votes in the country 2019s constitutional assembly. In Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood, which won the presidency by 52 per cent to 48 per cent, tried to force through an Islamist constitution by decree. It was toppled by a coup seven months later. Syria and Libya, meanwhile, appear not to know the meaning of the word consensus. Mr Ghannouchi, perhaps oddly, is still optimistic about the future of democracy in the Arab world. 201cThe year 2011 was a leap from tyranny in the Arab world, 201d he said. 201cHistory shows that the transition to democracy is not always linear 2013 the transitions that took place in France and Britain took over 100 years. 201d My brother is a lover of life and he would have rejected both the stupid politicians and death-loving extremists Whether the Arab world can last that long is another question. Mr Bouazizi 2019s family , whose initial fame turned to hostility in their community, could not: his mother and one sister moved to Canada, while another, Samia, now works in Tunis. She is the first to say that her brother 2019s death has been hijacked by politics and ideology. 201cHis death is destiny and I accept it, 201d she said at a caf 00e9 in the city. 201cBut if he were here he would be the first in the street to ask for more dignity. 201cMy brother created something that greedy people are trying to destroy in the region. My brother is a lover of life and he would have rejected both the stupid politicians and death-loving extremists. My brother died for dignity not for wealth or an ideology. 201d At the end of all the wars, few may end up remembering either him or Mrs Hamdy. The two began at opposite sides, but both now seem telescoped out of proportion by a history that became perverse beyond all recognition. 201cMohammed Bouazizi and I are both victims, 201d Mrs Hamdy said. 201cHe lost his life and my life is not the same any more. 201cWhen I look at the region and my country, I regret it all.

   "input": "The government (then Soviet) declared the area that lay within an 18-mile radius uninhabitable and resettled 116,000 residents with a pension, an apartment and sketchy information about the health risks that lay ahead. In the ensuing months and years, these first resettlers were followed by a few hundred thousand more, all displaced, most from the land where they 2019d grown up. But Hanna, who had been forced out in the first group, did not accept that fate. Three months after being relocated, she returned with her husband, her mother-in-law and a handful of other members of their collective farm. When government officials objected, she responded, 'Shoot us and dig the grave; otherwise we 2019re staying. 2019 Hanna was among some 1,200 returnees, called 'self-settlers 2019, most over the age of 48, who made their way back in the first few years after the accident, in defiance of the authorities 2019 legitimate concerns. For despite the self-settlers 2019 deep love of their ancestral homes, it 2019s a fact that the soil, air and water here in what is now known as the Exclusion Zone, or Zone of Alienation, are among the most heavily contaminated on earth. Today 230 or so self-settlers remain, scattered about in eerily silent villages that are ghostly but also somehow charming. About 80 per cent of the surviving self-settlers are women in their seventies and eighties, creating a unique world of babushkas, to use a Russian word that means 'grandmother 2019 but also refers to 'old countrywomen 2019. Why would the babushkas choose to live on this deadly land? Are they unaware of the risks, crazy enough to ignore them, or both? These are reasonable questions for Westerners who might stand in a grocery-shop aisle debating whether to pay the extra 00a32 for organic almond butter. The babushkas see their lives, and the risks they run, decidedly differently. Nadejda Gorbachenko,80, lives a few metres away from the barbed wire of the Exclusion Zone. She often goes through a hole in the wire to collect mushrooms and berries for her own consumption. 'When I see police, I hide in the bushes. Nobody will stop me 2019. Photo: RENA EFFENDI INSITUTE When Reactor No 4 blew up, roughly 30 per cent of the initial fall-out hit Ukraine and parts of western Russia, and 70 per cent landed downwind in Belarus. The gamma radiation was death-dealing: some 30 first responders were incapacitated immediately and expired within weeks. But the explosion 2019s long-term effect on the surrounding area was harder to quantify. 'Unlike the ground-zero fall-out from a nuclear bomb, which can be measured out 201ccircularly 201d with a compass, radiation from a nuclear fire such as Chernobyl lays waste in a spotty, inconsistent manner, 2019 explains Anna Korolevska, the scientific director of the National Chernobyl Museum. Which villages got doused? Which did not? Dosimeter readings, which indicate accumulated radiation exposure, varied wildly, and sometimes the Soviet authorities took bribes to alter them. Nadejda Tislenko, 71. When this widow met up with the reporter and photographer she immediately called a neighbour, saying, 'Hurry, quick, come over. There 2019s interesting people here, and they 2019re not missionaries! 2019 Photo: RENA EFFENDI INSITUTE What is clear about nuclear contaminants (cesium, strontium, plutonium and others) is that they enter the food chain through the soil, that they spread via wind and fire and that their effects are cumulative and linked to, among other things, increases in foetal mortality and cancer. In some cases, the contaminants stick around for thousands of years. After the accident, cows ingested grass tainted with radioactive iodine-131 (radioactive milk largely accounts for today 2019s sky-high thyroid-cancer rates in the area). As the 'invisible enemy 2019 enveloped the spring countryside, the babushkas may or may not have noticed that the birds fell silent and bees ceased flying, but they were alarmed when emergency workers made them dump their cows 2019 milk. Maria Urupa,77, was thinking about her cow when the soldiers arrived to evacuate her village of Paryshev. 'I planned to take my cow and hide in the basement, 2019 she says. Instead, she and her neighbours were relocated to a hurriedly constructed housing project outside Kiev, on land where many people had died in the 1930s during the Holodomor, the massive genocide-by-famine that the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin instigated in order to subjugate Ukraine and move peasant farmers on to state farming collectives or into factories. Maria Urupa,77, on her porch in Parishev village. When the authorities evacuated the village days after the accident, Maria 2019s first thought was to hide in the basement with her cow. On her return to Parishev after a few months, all the animals had been killed. Photo: RENA EFFENDI INSITUTE According to recent estimates, between three and-a-half million and five million Ukrainians died during this period, and many of the babushkas lost their fathers. Some almost died themselves since, during the Holodomor, starving villagers sometimes resorted to cannibalism, slaughtering one child to save the rest. Three months after moving there, Maria and her family returned to their home in the Exclusion Zone. When I meet her, she 2019s standing on her porch in sub-zero weather, looking healthy and stout, wearing a cotton housedress and a threadbare sweater. Maria recalls the day that Soviet troops, under orders from Stalin, marched on to the Urupa family farm. 'They took away two bulls, two pigs and all the potatoes, 2019 Maria says. 'My father was working for the church, which was not allowed then. 2019 When her father asked if he could keep a few potatoes, the soldiers threatened to kill him if he tried, saying, 201cYour soul will fly away, and we 2019ll wrap your guts around the telephone wire. 201d 2019 After Stalin came the Nazis, who slashed their way across Ukraine in the 1940s, raping and killing. About 10.5 million Ukrainians died during the Second World War. Having survived all that, the babushkas were not inclined to cut and run after the Chernobyl explosion created invisible threats in the air, soil and water. Hanna, who as an infant was nearly eaten by her family during the Holodomor, says it succinctly: 'Starvation is what scares me. Not radiation. 2019Most of the babushkas share the belief that 'if you leave, you die 2019. They would rather risk exposure to radiation than the soul-crushing prospect of being separated from their homes. 'You can 2019t take me from my mother; you can 2019t take me from my motherland. Motherland is motherland, 2019 says Hanna. Maria Vitosh,86, says, 'A pigeon flies close to his nest. I would never leave my home. 2019 She receives a monthly government pension of 800 hryvnia (about 00a360). Her son lives in a neighbouring village and worked in Chernobyl for 12 years after the accident, planting trees. Photo: RENA EFFENDI INSITUTE One refrain I heard often was, 'Those who left are worse off now. They are all dying of sadness. 2019What sounds like faith may actually be fact. According to reports by the United Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Children 2019s Fund, many of those who were relocated after the accident now suffer from anxiety, depression and disrupted social networks, the traumas of displaced people everywhere. And these conditions seem to have health effects as real as those caused by radiation. The journalist Alexander Anisimov, who spent his career studying the self-settler community, claimed that the women who returned to their ancestral homes in the zone outlived those who left by a decade. No health studies have been done, but anecdotal evidence suggests that most of the babushkas die of strokes rather than any obvious radiation-related illnesses, and they have dealt better with the psychological trauma. Toxic levels of strontium and cesium in the soil are real, but so are the tug of the ancestral home and the health benefits of determining one 2019s own destiny. East or West, pig fat or organic almond butter, few would deny that being happy helps you live longer. At first, of course, the main victims were those who were initially exposed to extreme doses of radiation. After the first responders were felled, the Soviets deployed robots to put out the fire, but radiation levels were so high the machines went berserk. The government then sent in a phalanx of human beings, dubbed liquidators, the translation of a Russian word that can also mean 'cleaner 2019. Galina Konyushok, now 71, was called to duty as a liquidator almost immediately. She worked in a nearby bread factory at the time of the accident and was charged with driving to the town of Chernobyl every day to pick up wheat so the government could feed the people working the disaster. Of course, the wheat itself was highly contaminated. Sitting today with three babushka neighbours in a kitchen bright with the reflection of the snow outside, Galina, who has thyroid cancer, looks strong and healthy. She lives in the town of Zirka, a few hundred yards outside the Exclusion Zone, whose boundary is demarcated by a chain-link and barbed-wire fence. Although it would be a stretch to call the babushkas a sisterhood, a deep camaraderie connects these women who have spent their entire lives in the area. They help one another at slaughtering time. They visit each other 2019s homes (on foot; they do not have cars) to play cards and gamble. 'But not for money. I keep telling them, the more you play, the more your brain works, 2019 Galina says, laughing. They joke about moving in together if heating-gas prices get too high (they are on fixed, modest government pensions), but emotional attachment to their homes runs too deep for that; home is the entire cosmos of the rural babushka. They have electricity, but most villages in the zone have a single phone; nobody has running water. Those with a television might sit with needlework to watch a soap opera after the chickens are fed and the wood is chopped. When asked about the dearth of men, Galina responds, 'The men died, and the women stayed. I wish I had a husband to quarrel with! 2019 In a corner of Galina 2019s house, beneath a bright window, stands the bed where her husband died 17 years ago (after making her promise never to leave their home). Galina 2019s exquisite embroidery gives warmth and colour to the three-room house where she 2019s lived for 52 years and raised four children. On a small table, a dozen or so medicines, an identification card and a blood-pressure machine tell a more sombre story. An ID reading 'disabled, first group 2019 indicates her liquidator status and her thyroid cancer. She waves away the medicines, as if to shoo off their significance, and shows me a piece of fabric embroidered with the message, 'Bring happiness and health to my motherland. 2019 Galina Konyushok,71, formerly a 'liquidator 2019 of the Chernobyl nuclear accident, now lives alone in Zirka village. She knits and makes traditional folk patterns and images of Christ on Ukranian cotton fabric. Photo: RENA EFFENDI INSITUTE 'I 2019m not afraid of anything anymore. It 2019s difficult to be old, but I still want to live, 2019 she says. Findings about the long-term health effects of Chernobyl are controversial and contradictory. The World Health Organization (WHO) predicts that more than 4,000 deaths will eventually be linked to Chernobyl, and it reports that thyroid-cancer rates have shot up in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, largely among those contaminated in the weeks immediately following the accident. However, WHO now considers the psychological impact to be at least as detrimental as the physical. Being depressed and unmotivated, pursuing an unhealthy lifestyle and clinging to a victim mind-set, it says, has proved to be the worst fall-out for the 'Chernobylites 2019. Other organisations, such as Greenpeace, contend that Chernobyl is responsible for tens of thousands of illnesses and deaths, even though these cannot yet be scientifically linked to the accident. All agree it will be generations before the consequences of Chernobyl can be fully understood. For now, the women 2019s spirit shines amid the bleak dead zone. Flashing a glint of gold from her lone tooth, Hanna reveals she has saved another pig to slaughter. 'I only think of the good things in life, 2019 she tells me, rolling on to the balls of her feet. 'Come back tomorrow, 2019 she says, holding up a chunk of thick pig fat. 'We 2019re going to party. 2019 All ages are correct from the time of the interviews.

   "input": "A photograph is only as accurate as its caption. The wrong one can lead to confusion 2014or worse 2014while a correct one may deepen the meaning of an action and our responses to it in unexpected ways. A case in point is Joe Rosenthal 2019s classic World War II photograph, taken Feb. 23,1945, of six U.S. Marines raising the American flag on Iwo Jima 2019s Mount Suribachi. After a review of evidence presented to a Marine Corps panel of retired officers and military historians 2014who relied on films, interviews, other photographs, clothing forensics, and facial-recognition software 2014the Pentagon announced last week that the man in the picture long thought to be Navy Pharmacist 2019s Mate 2nd Class John Bradley was, instead, Marine Pfc. Harold Schultz. The assiduous research necessary for this change of names on a caption, after more than 70 years, might seem excessive or even wasteful. But the impulse to establish facts about the past says something about the value of a photograph as a historic and an emotional artifact 2014and about the sweeping role played by this particular one. Shortly after publication, Rosenthal 2019s image 2014a pyramid of faceless bodies engaged in a collective struggle to display a national symbol 2014became among the most reproduced and consequential of the 20th century. Before the end of 1945, it appeared on a war-bonds poster and on a postage stamp, and had earned a Pulitzer Prize for Rosenthal. Less than a decade later, the photograph served as the model for the Marine Corps War Memorial, designed by sculptor Felix de Weldon and architect Horace Peaslee, and erected in 1954 at Arlington National Cemetery. More recently, James Bradley and co-writer Ron Powers built their best-selling book 201cFlags of our Fathers 201d (2000) partly on the mistaken belief that Mr. Bradley 2019s father was one of the six in the photograph, which was featured on the cover. Now, Mr. Bradley is adding a new afterword to future editions of the book, the basis for the 2006 movie directed by Clint Eastwood. Several ironies accompany this news. There were two flag raisings on Iwo Jima that day. The first flag went up in the morning but was deemed too small and unimpressive to be seen from afar, and so was taken down. In the afternoon, a second and larger flag was raised. Rosenthal (1911-2006) happened to notice the assembly and clicked the shutter. (He vehemently refuted stories that his photograph was 201cstaged. 201d Film of the second raising, taken by Marine Staff Sgt. Bill Genaust, later killed on Iwo Jima, backs up his claim.) While John Bradley has been ousted from Rosenthal 2019s rendition of the event, he has been restored to an honored place as one of those who took part in the first flag raising, which could be regarded as the 201coriginal. 201d His role is diminished only in the sense that he did not appear in the iconic photo and so isn 2019t one of the sculpted figures on the War Memorial. (He was awarded the Navy Cross for pulling a Marine infantryman to safety while under fire at Iwo Jima.) Neither Harold Schultz nor his family raised the issue of a possible inaccuracy. Instead, two retired Marines, Lt. Col. Matt Morgan and Sgt. Maj. John Dever, and a pair of amateur historians, Eric Krelle of Omaha, Neb., and Stephen Foley of Wexford, Ireland, were the sleuths who in the past few years had spurred the Marine Corps to revise the caption. These details only increase the resonance of Rosenthal 2019s image, where the faces of the men are all but unrecognizable. None raised the flag for his own glorification but rather out of a common sense of duty. Their outstanding quality as individuals in the picture is their anonymity and united sense of purpose. Schultz himself was so modest that, although he knew he was one of the six men depicted by Rosenthal, he died in 1995 without making a fuss to correct the record. ( 201cThe Unknown Flag Raiser of Iwo Jima, 201d a documentary on the reattribution and the detective work that led to it, will be broadcast Sunday on the Smithsonian Channel.) Photographs are often misleading, whether because of their incomplete or partial view; or due to memory errors by participants, as seems to have happened with Mr. Bradley 2019s father; or because of myth-making by the photographer. Alfred Stieglitz 2019s account of taking 201cThe Steerage 201d in 1907 was likely a wholesale fabrication, concocted to make him more of a prescient Modernist than he already was. Facts can be hard or impossible to ascertain. Did Robert Capa genuinely document, or just re-create for propaganda value, the 1936 scene of a stricken Republican fighter during the Spanish Civil War? Questions about its origins remain unanswered. Each of the 486 frames in Abraham Zapruder 2019s 26.6-second movie has been subjected to decades of minute analysis on every side of the JFK assassination debate. The images have been used to support a dozen contradictory scenarios. What 2019s encouraging is that some people care enough to research, as honestly as possible, the circumstances behind photographic images. The belief that they can still record the truth 2014or at least that discernible facts can be unearthed and fit into credible theories by a scientific sifting of evidence 2014has not passed away in the age of Photoshop. Certain photographs are monuments, too, and need to be treated as such. Mr. Woodward is an arts critic in New York.  ",

Chinese shares listed in Hong Kong or on U.S. exchanges account for just 5% of a typical foreign equity fund. But you know better. Earlier this week, the global markets plunged after China 2019s Shanghai composite index sank by 7% on worse-than-expected economic news. Things got so bad that Chinese regulators temporarily halted trading in that nation 2019s stock market, sending ripples of fears around the world. In the U.S., the Dow Jones industrial average sank as much as 450 points before closing down 276 points on Monday. The same thing happened last summer. In late August, China 2019s market crashed, and the echo sent U.S. equities down by double digits too. Such is the pull of the world 2019s second-largest economy. Once the key driver of global growth, China 2019s GDP rate has declined from 9.5% in 2011 to 7.7% in 2013 to 6.8% last year. This year China 2019s GDP is likely to grow 6.3%, says the International Monetary Fund. Yet before you panic, keep these three things in mind: First, the decelerating economy, like the boom that preceded it, is being engineered by China 2019s government. 201cThe goal is to transition China from a fast-growing manufacturing economy to a slower-growing but more stable consumer economy, 201d says Danton Goei, co-manager of Davis Global. Currently the portion of GDP generated by consumers is just 35% in China, vs. 65% in the U.S. 201cThere 2019s a lot of room for China 2019s consumer economy to grow, but the transition will be tricky, 201d says Goei.

Davontae Sanford's sentence of up to 90 years was vacated by Wayne County Judge Brian Sullivan, according to statements from the Dykema Gossett law firm, which handled Sanford's appeal, and the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office, which also moved to overturn the conviction after a reinvestigation. He will be released from prison on Wednesday. SEE ALSO: 6 states listed as prime targets on new ISIS 'kill list' After being arrested in 2007, Sanford gave an inaccurate confession to the killings and pleaded guilty to four counts of second-degree homicide on the advice of an attorney now suspended from the practice of law, the Dykema Gossett statement said. In April 2008 , two weeks after Sanford's sentencing, a professional hit man, Vincent Smothers, confessed to the Runyon Street killings and eight additional murders, the statement from the law firm said.

The Wayne County prosecutor's office agreed Sanford's second-degree murder conviction should be vacated after state police took another look at the case. (Michigan Department of Corrections via AP, File) More than 1,810 exonerations have been recorded in the United States since 1989, for murder and other crimes, and the pace has increased steadily over the years to about three a week, according to the National Registry of Exonerations run by the University of Michigan Law School. The trend has been driven both by so-called innocence projects run by law schools and by special units established within prosecutors' offices to examine possible false confessions and official misconduct. In the Detroit case, the judge ordered prosecutors to file a motion to dismiss the case, which means Sanford will not be retried, said a statement from Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy's office. State police reinvestigated the case and found that a deputy who originally gave sworn testimony that Sanford drew an accurate diagram of the crime scene, later contradicted that testimony, the prosecutor's office's statement said. The Michigan Innocence Clinic and other groups that work to overturn wrongful convictions had appealed the conviction, arguing that Smothers' confession matched the details of what happened in the murders, while Sanford's did not.

   "input": "We have entered a new season of intense constitutional debate. Today's Supreme Court will, in the next few years, face serious challenges to the unprecedented constitutional reach of Barack Obama's health-care program 2014and likely to other ambitious federal ventures. As if to prepare the ground for a new confrontation, President Obama used his State of the Union address last January to scold the Supreme Court 2014with the chief justice and several other justices sitting right before him in the House chamber 2014for a decision giving free-speech protection to corporate political spending. In this climate, Noah Feldman, Harvard law professor and prolific author, offers an overview of the intertwined careers of Justices Hugo Black, William O. Douglas, Felix Frankfurter and Robert Jackson. They were all appointed by Franklin Roosevelt in the aftermath of the bruising battle, in 1937, when FDR tried and failed to expand the size of the Supreme Court to ensure a pro-New Deal majority. Retirements in the next few years allowed him to appoint new justices who reinterpreted our constitutional doctrines to accommodate ambitious federal agendas. So Scorpions might seem very timely. Mr. Feldman has certainly shown a knack for placing himself in the middle of great contemporary debates. On the strength of a brief period studying Arabic literature at Oxford , he was recruited in 2003 to advise on Iraq's interim constitution 2014when he was, himself, only a few years out of law school. His subsequent book, What We Owe Iraq (2004) , was a liberal plea for a continuing military effort to stabilize Iraq. As opposition to the war mounted, however, Mr. Feldman distanced himself from other democracy advocates with The Fall and Rise of the Islamic State (2008) , depicting Sharia law as a historic and still promising check on abusive government. He is certainly alert to the politics that surrounded (and often threatened to engulf) FDR's Supreme Court appointees. Mr. Feldman devotes well over a third of the book to tracing the paths by which these great justices got to the court. Hugo Black (1886-1971) used his affiliation with the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s to get himself elected to the Senate. Then , as a Supreme Court nominee, he reassured fellow senators with carefully worded (and misleading) disavowals of Klan connections. Roosevelt, grateful that Black had supported his court-packing plan, looked the other way. Felix Frankfurter (1882-1965), a Harvard professor and Roosevelt confidant since the latter's days as New York's governor, was not consulted about the court-packing plan in advance. But he withheld public criticism 2014offending his long-time patron, Justice Louis Brandeis, an open opponent of FDR's scheme. William O. Douglas (1898- 1980) had charmed Roosevelt with his bullying of Wall Street as SEC chairman in the mid-1930s. Robert Jackson (1892-1954) caught FDR's eye arguing the administration's dubious and partisan tax claims against former Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon. Even after taking their seats on the court, both continued to attend intimate White House poker games. While a justice, Frankfurter was not invited to play cards, but he continued to offer private advice on all manner of subjects to the Roosevelt White House and the Justice Department. The book offers a wealth of anecdotes but no revelations. Almost all the material in Scorpions is drawn from previously published accounts. Mr. Feldman tells these stories in a graceful narrative , cutting back and forth between different characters, situating personal doings in the great events of the era. It's effective popular history. For a scholar who holds a chair at Harvard Law School, though, Mr. Feldman is remarkably uninterested in legal analysis. The core of the book takes readers through a dozen or so landmark legal disputes of the 1940s and 1950s, but even here he keeps his focus on the interplay of personalities on the Supreme Court. He makes little effort to evaluate the weight of these cases as precedents and offers no discussion at all of the cases in the early 1940s, when the Roosevelt appointees repudiated all past limits on federal regulatory power. It is not much compensation to get two chapters on Justice Jackson's dramatic moments as Nuremberg prosecutor 2014with no explanation of the actual charges in these cases and the simple assurance that most historians consider the Nuremberg tribunal to have been a highly consequential historical event. The biggest problem with Mr. Feldman's account is that , while all the Roosevelt appointees agreed that there should be broad constitutional scope for New Deal programs, they emphasized different reasons and followed the arguments to different results as they encountered new issues. Frankfurter, for example, consistently urged judicial deference to legislative judgments, while Black insisted that the courts must uphold the words of the Constitution 2014which in his reading allowed almost limitless scope for economic regulation but set sharp limits on government in other areas. Over the years, their divisions became increasingly personal and acrimonious (so much so that Black and Douglas threatened to resign if Jackson were appointed chief justice after the war). Mr. Feldman acknowledges these differences 2014starting with his title (drawn from a Frankfurter law clerk's characterization of the Supreme Court as nine scorpions in a bottle) 2014but tries to celebrate all four great justices equally , as if their negative estimations of each other were mere personal foibles. He acknowledges, for example, that some legal scholars view Douglas's opinions as arbitrary and outrageous; others view him as the most advanced exponent of liberal principle ever to sit on the Court. Mr. Feldman is content to acknowledge that there is truth in both propositions; he is not interested in defining any possible boundary between liberal principle and arbitrary constitutional decisions. At the end , Mr. Feldman assures us, whether by principle , by pragmatism or by policy, the justices at their best make the Constitution their own. And so , he thinks, do we all: To interpret the Constitution by one's own best lights is to be an American. What if your best lights are dim or distorting? Do we have millions of constitutions or only nine? If this was intended as a defense of liberal jurisprudence , it suggests that, even at Harvard, what liberals are mainly selling is nostalgia. There was a time when simply supporting the New Deal could earn a judge a great reputation. Those happy days don't seem to be here again, now. 2014Mr. Rabkin is professor of law at George Mason University.  ",

In a new exhibition, the J. Paul Getty Museum at Los Angeles 2019 Getty Center will draw attention to paper negatives, an early method that some curators and collectors revere for its painterly riff on photographic clarity. 201cReal Ideal: Photography in France, 1847 20131860, 201d which opens Aug. 30, recalls the careers of 00c9douard Baldus, Gustave Le Gray, Henri Le Secq and Charles N 00e8gre. All four created photos developed from paper negatives to capture the buildings and byways of Second Empire France. Paper negatives had 201ca brief moment of glory, 201d says the Getty 2019s Karen Hellman, who relied on the museum 2019s renowned photography department for most of the 150 works and objects on view. The paper process first flourished in France in the late 1840s, following a cross-Channel rivalry between two of photography 2019s pioneers. Louis Daguerre was capturing real images on small sheets of silver-treated copper 2014soon widely known as daguerreotypes. In England, William Henry Fox Talbot was creating negative images on sensitized paper, which could then be used to create 201cpositive 201d photographic prints. Daguerreotypes were better for portraits, Ms. Hellman says, but prints from paper negatives were more suited to architecture and landscapes. She admires the photos 2019 201crich shadows, 201d comparing them to charcoal drawings. Ms. Hellman says that the title of the exhibition is a reminder that photography is 201ctied to the real 201d but is also 201ca medium with creative possibilities. 201d The title also suggests the vivid but dreamy quality of the photos that resulted from the paper-negative process. The four photographers were often drawn to similar subjects, like historic buildings, and the show chronicles the early emergence of individual photographic styles. Baldus (1813 201389) and N 00e8gre (1820 201380) both photographed Avignon 2019s Papal Palace, in the south of France. Baldus aimed for a monumental, panoramic effect, says Ms. Hellman, while N 00e8gre shot the scene from a lower vantage point to get a more pedestrian point of view. Le Gray (1820 201384) was one of the first to treat his paper negatives with wax, which Ms. Hellman says helped to consolidate the paper fibers in the paper negative, so the image recorded was sharper and more detailed. When glass-plate negatives began to replace the paper technique during the 1850s, he promoted the newer technology. Today, Le Gray is the best known of the four, and his works now fetch the highest prices at auction, says Darius Himes, Christie 2019s international head of photographs. In February, a pin-sharp Le Gray naval scene from 1856-57, developed from a glass-plate negative, sold for $965,000 at a sale at Christie 2019s New York. The presale estimate was $300,000 to $500,000. The Getty show, which closes Nov. 27, includes loans from Paris 2019s Mus 00e9e d 2019Orsay and France 2019s National Library. The exhibition includes actual paper and glass negatives as well as the finished photos.

   "input": "FORTUNE 2014 You may be experiencing neck strain if you 2019ve been trying to track Wal-Mart 2019s position on a federal minimum wage increase over the last couple of days. Bloomberg made waves on Wednesday when it reported that the mega-retailer was looking at backing a federal wage hike. Considering the company 2019s size 2014 it employs 1.3 million people in the U.S. alone, roughly 1% of the entire private-sector workforce 2014 such a pronouncement could have a seismic impact on the living-wage debate heating up in the capital. Except that the company isn 2019t considering throwing its support behind the Democratic push. Wal-Mart WMT spokesman David Tovar, who gave the interview to Bloomberg that set off the frenzy, made that much clear on Thursday in follow-up interviews with other outlets, including Fortune. The company, Tovar says, is simply monitoring the debate to assess what impact any new policy could have on its business. That said, Wal-Mart will remain neutral unless it decides a proposed minimum wage increase either unfairly targets the company while exempting other retailers, as it did in Washington, or doesn 2019t allow employers to phase the higher wage in over time. 201cIf a proposal meets those conditions, we 2019ll stay out of it, 201d Tovar says. 201cIf they don 2019t, we 2019ll strongly consider opposing it. 201d MORE: How Gap 2019s wage hike will boost its bottom line But if history is any guide, it seems the company is at least partially responsible for the confusion over its position. Most of the reports this week stated that Wal-Mart lent crucial support to a higher federal pay standard when the issue was last before Congress, in 2007 (and the rate rose from $5.15 to $7.25 per hour). But the evidence of that support is limited to a speech then-CEO Lee Scott delivered in 2005. In that address, to company directors and executives, Scott gave what appeared to be a stirring exhortation in support of raising the wage. 201cWe can see first-hand at Wal-Mart how many of our customers are struggling to get by. Our customers simply don 2019t have the money to buy basic necessities between paychecks, 201d Scott said. 201cWhile it is unusual for us to take a public position on a public policy issue of this kind, we simply believe it is time for Congress to take a responsible look at the minimum wage and other legislation that may help working families. 201d A year later, with both chambers of Congress considering legislation to accomplish just that, Wal-Mart went missing. The company 2019s then-top lobbyist, Lee Culpepper, told me at the time that Scott 2019s comments had been misinterpreted. The chief executive wasn 2019t calling on Congress explicitly to raise the minimum wage; he was just asking lawmakers to consider it. 201cWe haven 2019t said anything more or less, 201d he said. Last year, after President Obama used his State of the Union address to call for raising the rate to $9.00 an hour, Wal-Mart was similarly circumspect, saying only that it was 201creviewing 201d the proposal. MORE: Minimum wage fight: Here we go again The fence-straddling makes sense from a strategic perspective. The company has worked in recent years to sand the harder edges off of its anti-labor rep 2014 a mission that has taken on some urgency as the store expands its footprint into urban areas heavily represented by Democrats in Congress. The shift in approach is evident in Wal-Mart 2019s political giving. The company directed just 21% of its contributions to Democrats back in the 2002 election cycle. A decade later, it more than doubled Democrats 2019 share to 48%, according to figures from the Center for Responsive Politics.

(AAP) Ambulance Victoria has revealed hopes for a system to predict future thunderstorm asthma events so resources 201caren't wasted 201d every time a storm appears on the horizon. The organisation received several dozen calls from people with breathing problems yesterday afternoon as thunderstorms rolled in across the state. But of the 60 respiratory cases recorded, only four were active treatment for asthma. All the others ... had nothing to do with what we would term thunderstorm asthma , Ambulance Victoria state health commander Paul Holman told 3AW this morning. Victorians have been on high alert about the potential for thunderstorm asthma attacks after eight people died after a storm event two weeks ago. Extra ambulance crews were rostered on yesterday as authorities warned asthmatics of the potential increased risk. Mr Holman said that was partly to reassure the community. I don't want to be doing this every time we see a thunderstorm on the horizon because we're just wasting resources , he said. Aggressive work is now underway to develop a scientific thunderstorm asthma forecasting system. If it can be predicted , then we can take some action in terms of health warnings and resourcing, 201d Mr Holman reported. Victorian temperatures peaked at 37.3 degrees in Charlton yesterday with 31.7 degrees recorded in Melbourne. Thunderstorms hit the city's west, areas around Port Phillip Bay, the inland north and central highlands. It's looking more settled for the next couple of days , Bureau of Meteorology senior forecaster Chris Godfred said. But we do have another relatively strong cold front that's going to move across Victoria on Thursday morning that will bring widespread showers and the risk of storms. Thunderstorm asthma is caused when dust and pollen is blown in or ahead of a storm. Moisture causes pollen grains to burst into tiny fragments that can penetrate deep into the airways. 00a9 Nine Digital Pty Ltd 2016  ",

   "input": "H ISTORIC breakthroughs are not, alas, what they used to be 2014 at least in the world of art. Take the exhibition of photographs by William Eggleston that opened this week at the Museum of Modern Art (through Aug. 1). We are invited by John Szarkowski, director of the department of photography at the museum, to look upon this as a very significant event. To underscore the point, the museum has prepared a poshy, hard 2010cover book of 112 pages ($12.50, M.I.T. Press) to accompany the show 2014a fairly unusual procedure for the first solo exhibition by an artist few people have ever heard of. In his text for the book, Mr. Szarkowski throws all caution to the winds and speaks of Mr. Eggleston's pictures as 201cperfect. 201d Perfect? Perfectly banal, perhaps. Perfectly boring, certainly. A perfect example of what, for Mr. Szarkowski and many like 2010minded connoisseurs of contemporary photography, is now a. la mode. But this is not, of course, what Mr. Szarkowski means by 201cperfect. 201d He means that Mr. Eggleston's pictures achieve a rare degree of excellence and originality, and that 2014to put the matter mildly 2014is something about which opinions will differ. What does make this show unusual, if not exactly historic, is that it is the museum's first major exhibition of photographs in color. The book, 201cWilliam Eggleston's Guide, 201d is likewise the museum's first publication on color photography, with 48 plates 2014more than half the exhibition 2014printed in color. Even the text is printed on paper that is the color of green bathroom shower in one of Mr. Eggleston's pictures. As color is now one of the 201chot 201d problems in this medium long dominated by black and white images, it would be news indeed if Mr. Eggleston's pictures were the masterpieces they are claimed to be. In my opinion, they are not. That bathroom shower is an index to the kind of subject Mr. Eggleston favors. He likes trucks, cars, tricycles unremarkable suburban houses and dreary landscapes, too, and he especially likes his family and friends, who may, for all I know, be wonderful people, but who appear in these pictures as dismal figures inhabiting a commonplace world of little visual interest. The locations are Memphis, where Mr. Eggleston lives, and Tallahatchie County, Mississippi, where his family's cotton farm is. The use of color, alleged to lend a special distinction to these pictures is, to my eye at least, similarly commonplace. It varies from being obviously pretty (a bright blue pickup truck seen through the growth of wisteria in bloom) to being obviously austere (the gray 2014 black 2014 off 2014 white tones of the interior of a household oven). Mostly it is postcard bright, in the outdoor daylight pictures, or ponderously atmospheric, in the interior shots. There is no great formal intelligence at work in these pictures, either. Mr. Szarkow ski makes much of the fact that Mr. Eggleston places most of his subjects plunk down in the center of his pictonal space, or just off center, as if this were some remarkable esthetic feat. It is not. The truth is, these pictures belong to the world of snapshot chic 2014to the post 2010Diane Arbus, antiformalist esthetic that is now all the rage among many younger photographers and that has all but derailed Mr. Szarkowski's taste so far as contemporary photography is concerned. To this snapshot style, Mr. Eggleston has added some effects borrowed from recent developments in, of all things, photorealist painting 2014a case, if not of the blind leading the blind, at least of the banal leading the banal. For purely negative reasons, this is a show 2014made possible, as they say, by grants from Vivitar Inc. and the National Endowment for the Arts 2014that has to be seen to be believed. What a relief it is to turn from these pictorial banalities to the work of a genuine imagination! Clarence John Laughlin, whose exhibition of photographs called 201cThe Transforming Eye 201d is now at the International Center of Photography, Fifth Avenue at 94th Street (through June 6), is not a discovery, of course. He is one of the great classics of American photography 2014 an artist with an almost feverish gift for invention. Working within the traditional limits of the blackand 2010white print, he achieves an extraordinary visual poetry 2014an art of the fantastic that is one of the special accomplishments of our time. Mr. Laughlin has long been a resident of New Orleans, and some of the enchantment of that magical city has found its way into his pictures. Some of the romance of Surrealism 2014especially the romance of the unconscaous 2014 has deeply affected 2010 his art, too. The result, whether his pictures are 201cstraight 201d or elaborately composed of separate, incongruous images superimposed to form a haunting evocation of an interiar universe, is a feast for 2010the eye. New Orleans providtis Mr. Laughlin with some Of his most bizarre 201cstraight 201d pictures. (With cemeteries and architectural ornament like New Orleans's, who needs embellishments?) So do the decayed and abandoned touisiana plantation houses Of a few decades ago that. he made one of his photographic specialties. These pictures alone would guarantee, Mr. Laughlin a place among classics. But his other specialty is what he calls the 201cvisual poem 201d 2014a term he reserves for a particular category, of picture but that I would apply to all of his 201cinvented 201d images. These range from synthetic landscape fantasies (Passage to Never Land 201d) enveloped in a macabre, painterly light, to pictures in which a figure standing beside a doorway filled with debris, say, peers at us through an elaborate oval picture frame ( 201dThe Ego 2010Centrics 201d). We are in a world of deliberate, devilish symbolism in these pictures, and their sheer visual power is extraordinary. It says something about the force of Mr. Laughlin's imagination that even, his architectural photographs often look as if their subjects have been invented in the darkroom. He is an original, a romantic of the generation 2014I often think of Martha Graham when I see his pictures 2014 that looked upon'the pictorial specifications of ,the world we inhabit as a key to an inward, infinitely, absorbing universe of poetic implication.

   "input": "Is the quest for clean doing more harm than good? That 2019s the question at the heart of a debate between cleaning-products makers, researchers and environmental advocates. The outcome could affect millions of Americans who use antibacterial soaps, body washes and shower gels to fight germs 2014as well as the companies that supply the $5.5 billion market for soap, bath and shower products. In September, the Food and Drug Administration will announce a decision on whether companies that make and market antibacterial soaps containing certain ingredients have demonstrated they are safe and more effective than plain soap and water in preventing illness. If the FDA decides against them, the companies must reformulate the products 2014a step a number of big manufacturers have already taken, citing public concerns 2014and may need to remove claims from their labels. The proposed new rules are part of a more sweeping review of virtually all antiseptic products used in the war against germs that are rinsed off or left on, including those used in hospitals to fight the rise in virulent bacteria and protect patients from infection. The FDA also plans to review hand sanitizers, including those based on alcohol, and it 2019s weighing separate rules for food-processing workers. The chemicals used in antibacterial cleaners have been around for decades and are used in a wide range of other products There 2019s a lack of hard data linking them to human health outcomes. The FDA first judged some chemicals were safe and effective in 1994. But the most commonly used chemical, triclosan, was always under separate scrutiny, and while the FDA never took formal action, since then studies have suggested it can interfere with hormones and cause changes in thyroid, reproductive-growth and developmental systems. And some research indicates that the booming use of antibacterials is contributing to the creation of superbugs that are resistant to the antibiotics long used to fight them. With new evidence that exposure is higher than previously thought and advances in technology to detect chemicals in the body, new data is needed to assess long-term effects, says Theresa M. Michele, director of the Division of Nonprescription Drug Products in the FDA 2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. 201cWe now know we can measure small amounts of ingredients in blood and that things you put on your skin can potentially be absorbed into the body, 201d Dr. Michele says. Her advice: 201cAt this point, wash your hands with plain soap and water, because we don 2019t have enough data demonstrating these antibacterial soaps are any better 201d in fighting disease. The FDA review, which includes 22 chemicals, has pitted the $30 billion cleaning-products industry, which maintains the products are safe and more effective than regular soap, against environmental groups and some scientists who charge they are not only no more effective than regular soap, but are dangerous to health and should be banned or restricted to fighting dangerous outbreaks in hospitals. Both sides in the debate have submitted reams of evidence to the FDA supporting their stance, offering up conflicting studies that make it a challenge for the average consumer to make informed decisions. Most of the controversy focuses on triclosan and a related chemical, triclocarban, first introduced in the 1950s and 1960s, respectively. Triclosan is an antibacterial chemical agent widely used in liquid hand soaps, other personal-care products such as body and face washes, cosmetics, school supplies and kitchenware. It works by killing or weakening bacteria, similar to the way antibiotic drugs prevent or treat infections. But while antibiotics are prescribed to cure disease, antibacterials are aimed at preventing the spread of disease-causing bacteria to people who aren 2019t infected, including by handling contaminated food and objects, or skin-to-skin contact. In the case of antibiotics, because the drugs have been used so widely for so long, many types of bacteria have adapted. The FDA and some scientists are now concerned that antibacterial chemicals like triclosan, which linger in the environment and can be absorbed in the body, are also contributing to antibiotic resistance. A new Minnesota law will prohibit some cleaning products like hand soap and body wash containing triclosan after Jan. 1, 2017. The American Cleaning Institute, which represents about 140 companies, is moving to satisfy the FDA 2019s data requirements for the safety and effectiveness of antibacterial ingredients, says Richard Sedlak, executive vice president, technical and international affairs. The institute and others have asked the FDA to defer rule making on three other ingredients companies are using as an alternative to triclosan 2014benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride and chloroxylenol 2014to allow time to submit new safety and effectiveness data. The FDA 2019s Dr. Michele says it is considering the request. But the cleaning institute takes the position that the FDA has 201cneglected a substantial amount of existing safety data 201d showing the chemicals are effective in reducing the level of bacteria on the skin and more effective than soap that 2019s not antibacterial. Along with another organization, the Personal Care Products Council, it has submitted extensive data to support its view that triclosan has been used safely for decades and has been extensively reviewed and permitted around the world, with no data directly linking it to human harm. Makers of antibacterial bath products also dispute that they are contributing to the creation of superbugs, noting that studies have shown that overuse of prescription antibiotics in humans and livestock is the driving force behind antibiotic resistance. And the organizations warn that banning antibacterial products would increase the level of risk and exposure of the general population to bacteria, leading to increased infection and disease, including 7.5 million cases of food-borne illness and $38 billion in health-care costs annually. An FDA spokeswoman says the agency has no comment on that estimate. The FDA initially proposed a rule that would have disallowed triclosan in hand soaps in 1978 because there wasn 2019t enough evidence to show it was safe and effective. In 1994, the FDA amended that to say some chemicals were safe for consumer soaps, but continued to propose that additional data were needed for other ingredients, including triclosan. The nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council sued the FDA in 2010, alleging the agency had unreasonably delayed taking action. The FDA signed a consent decree to settle the suit, and issued a new proposed rule in 2013, continuing to propose that triclosan not be available for use in consumer washes unless additional safety and effectiveness data were provided to the FDA. The consent decree imposed a September 2016 deadline for a final rule for consumer soaps and set out future deadlines for the FDA to rule on health-care antiseptics and consumer hand sanitizers, including those that are alcohol-based. A 2014 review of evidence and regulatory actions published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology acknowledged there is a 201cpaucity of data 201d on triclosan 2019s adverse effects on humans. But the review notes that U.S. streams have a 60% to 100% likelihood of containing detectable quantities of the chemicals, and they have been detected in high levels in municipal sludge and drinking water, and urine and breast milk. While consumers may use soaps for a few seconds and wash them down the drain, their environmental afterlife is much longer, measured at time scales of up to several decades, the review found. 201cThere is undeniable evidence that these chemicals have suffused modern life, and we have to question whether this is a good idea, 201d says Rolf Halden, author of the review and director of Arizona State University 2019s Biodesign Center for Environmental Security. 201cIt 2019s virtually impossible to link one particular exposure to these agents, but on a population basis, you see associations between exposure and effect. 201d Antibacterial agents 201ccan play an important role in hospitals and health-care settings, but they do not belong in all households, our food supply and our bodies at all times, 201d he says. The American Cleaning Institute 2019s Mr. Sedlak says the vast majority of chemicals are removed during wastewater treatment, but even if some remain, 201cthere is no expectation that there should be adverse consequences of minute traces of triclosan in the environment, 201d where it continues to break down. He adds that the institute isn 2019t aware of any studies demonstrating high levels in drinking water. The National Toxicology Program, at the request of the FDA, is studying the potential for cancer to occur through skin exposure to triclosan. The cleaning institute has told the FDA in comments that it does not believe the study is necessary based on earlier studies of oral exposure that found no evidence of a cancer-causing effect relevant to humans. And Mr. Sedlak says his organization isn 2019t aware of any studies that link the low levels of triclosan exposure from its use in consumer antiseptic products to a risk of cancer. Researchers continue to disagree over whether antibacterial soaps provide any benefit over washing with soap and water. A study by South Korean researchers, published last year in the Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, found that under 201creal life 201d hand-washing conditions of about 20 seconds, antibacterial soap containing the maximum amount of triclosan allowed by law was no more effective than plain soap at reducing contamination from 20 bacterial strains. But in a 2014 study partly funded by the American Cleaning Institute and the Personal Care Products Council, researchers at Rutgers University had study participants 2019 hands inoculated with Shigella bacteria before washing their hands then handling melon balls. Three antibacterial cleansers, including one containing triclosan, were significantly more effective in reducing the concentration of the bacteria on their hands and the melon balls relative to two regular soap products. The study was published in the Journal of Food Protection. Popular alcohol-based hand sanitizers are considered less of a threat to human health and the development of antibiotic resistance. Still, the FDA has asked for additional data about alcohol-based sanitizers used in hospitals, where staffers may clean or sanitize their hands up to 100 times a day. For cleaning-products makers, the stakes are high. The FDA estimates the costs of the proposed rule could be as high as $369 million. The agency probably wouldn 2019t require any product recalls, but companies wouldn 2019t be able to put more on the market that didn 2019t meet new standards. feff Henkel Corp. , the maker of Dial soaps, says that beginning in December 2014, it removed triclosan from all retail hand soap and foaming-wash products and replaced it with benzethonium chloride, which has equivalent performance. Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson have also phased out triclosan, saying that while evidence has shown it to be safe, to respond to consumer concerns they are reformulating products with other ingredients. Colgate Palmolive is approved to use triclosan in its Total toothpaste, where studies have shown it is effective against gingivitis, but removed it from the Softsoap brand in 2012. Colgate settled a class-action suit last year claiming it falsely advertised the soaps could kill most germs. A spokesman says it did so to avoid the cost of a trial, and denies the allegations of deceptive labeling and marketing. Some hospital groups are backing away from certain antibacterials. Kaiser Permanente has banned triclosan and identified 13 antimicrobial chemicals it wants banned from its hospitals because they don 2019t have health benefits and may be toxic, according to Kathy Gerwig, Kaiser 2019s environmental-stewardship officer and vice president of employee safety, health and wellness. 201cWe want to use our purchasing power to send a message that it 2019s not OK to use ingredients that might be harmful to our health, 201d Ms. Gerwig says.

   "input": "The turkey you're eating, my brother told me as I bit into my sandwich , is actually tofu. And the cheese is actually rice cheese. That's probably the most memorable thing I heard during week 21 of The Money Diet. I was on a hike with my brother , Kevin, and we were sitting on a bench on the trail, somewhere in a forest in some park near Germantown, Ohio, overlooking a scenic river. We'd been hiking for about an hour when we decided to stop for lunch. This activity -- the hiking, not the eating of lunch -- was some time coming, and something I need to do more of. As anyone who reads this column regularly knows, I'm in the midst of a quest to lose weight, and I've been primarily trying to do so by cutting out snacks and junk food and then, as motivation, adding up what I'm saving by not buying this stuff. While it worked pretty well for awhile -- I lost 20 pounds then gained a few back -- I'm in my plateau stage , as I like to call it. That , in a sense, is what brought me to the tick-infested woods in 87-degree weather, eating a rice cheese and tofu sandwich on low-calorie bread. Where do you even find this? I asked Kevin. I mean , this isn't bad. The tofu is surprisingly tasty, and I could even see me buying rice cheese. On the perimeter of the grocery store , said Kevin. You know , around the walls. It's, like, a whole different grocery store there. We hardly ever go into the middle of the store any more. told me , I said , adding, She's this nutritionist for The Money Diet column thing I write. It's like you're channeling her. For anyone looking to eat a healthier sandwich and unfamiliar with tofu and rice cheese , I can now tell you that it's tastier than you'd expect. As for how I did this week, well, I still haven't lost any more weight, which I find mystifying. It seems like it's been years -- instead of weeks -- since I've been to a fast food restaurant for anything other than a diet soda -- and I've gone light on the snacks for months now. And, granted, it just one hike, but it was about a three-hour hike across some really steep hills. In fact, I even had an Indiana Jones moment, in which I tripped, twisted in the air, fell on the ground and was suddenly clinging to a tree root. If I'd rolled over, off the path, I would have kept going down a 50-degree incline and landing either on another path, 20 feet down, or perhaps, another that was maybe 300 feet down. It wouldn't have been pretty. But do the diet gods reward me for this? No. I haven't lost a thing. Here's how my weight, once again, looks: But at least I have extra money this week. Here's what I think I saved. I had two, day-long business trips this week, during which I drove from my house to a company about two hours away. In the old days, I would have grabbed breakfast at a fast food place and would have bought a snack on the way back. Other than Diet Coke, I purchased nothing, packing my own breakfast and ate no snacks. Total estimated savings, given that I had four opportunities to spend money: $14. The day before my hike with my brother, I went to two parks with my oldest daughter. Then I treated her to some ice cream and bought nothing for myself. Savings: $1.99. On the day I went hiking with my brother, I was invited to a dine-in restaurant with my parents, grandmother and some relatives. It's a monthly thing, but Kevin and I decided to do our hike instead. While the restaurant wasn't really a fast food joint, it does serve burgers and fries, which I probably would have ordered, so I'm better off, nutritionally speaking, for having skipped it. Estimated savings: $8. I went to the grocery store at least twice this week, and I avoided buying chips and candy, two of my weaknesses in the past. The worst thing I believe I purchased were some fiber bars to snack on. Estimated savings: $6. What's really troubling is that I'm on the verge of driving several states away, to Milwaukee, to be in a wedding with a bunch of my old college friends. Not only will I show up at this unofficial, almost 20-year college reunion not looking slim and trim, but there'll likely be plenty of opportunities to eat high-calorie, delicious but unhealthy foods. Oh, joy.  ",

Dr. Shaul Debbi,48, pleaded for leniency before being sentenced in Manhattan Federal Court. I don't have any words to describe how sorry I am , said Debbi , who pleaded guilty in May to two counts of Medicare fraud. Judge Jed Rakoff ordered Debbi to pay $885,030 in restitution. The plea deal also required Debbi to surrender his medical license. Debbi, of Great Neck, L.I., was arrested last year and charged with overbilling Medicare for hundreds of medical procedures that were never performed or were unnecessary at several adult homes, including the Leben Home for Adults in Queens. Prosecutors said Debbi was motivated by greed. Frankly , he just wanted to steal money, said prosecutor Paul Radvany. Rakoff handed down the minimum sentence , citing letters he received from Debbi's friends and adult home operators who praised Debbi for his charitable works. He could have given Debbi a 41-month prison sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines. Defense attorney John Wing said Debbi deserved a break because he was an excellent doctor who did enormous good for people who needed it. But prosecutor Daniel Ruzumna disagreed. We have not , through our investigation, uncovered a man who was concerned about patient care, he said.  ",

   "input": "For Nev Schulman, a 24-year-old New York City photographer who became entangled in a twisted online love affair with the girl of his dreams, it all began innocently enough. In 2007, Schulman was contacted by an 8-year-old girl named Abby on MySpace. A budding artist from the remote upper peninsula of Michigan, Abby said she'd seen one of Schulman's photographs published in a newspaper months before, and wanted permission to paint it. Weeks later, Schulman received a watercolor rendition of his photograph. I was kind of floored , he recalled , describing the young prodigy's work. We all said , 'Wow, this is great!' Schulman sent Abby more of his photographs to paint. With her mother Angela's blessing , the two began to correspond online and Schulman developed a friendship with the entire family. I was in a weird place in my life where I didn't have a lot going on ... and it was very flattering , Schulman told 20 20's Jay Schadler. She was inspiring me and... it was a really strangely reciprocal kind of give and take. Schulman was blown away to learn from Angela that local art dealers were bidding on Abby's paintings; one had sold for $7 , 000. It was just so satisfying to feel like I was contributing to some little girl's life , he said. Watch the full story on 20 20 tonight at 10 p.m. ET Schulman was flooded with packages filled with Abby's drawings and paintings. That's when Schulman's brother Ariel and friend Henry Joost -- both filmmakers who shot Schulman and their friends hanging around all the time -- said they sensed a story was building. That's when I started filming because he would go , 'Pick these packages up, bring them down to the office and slice them open, ' said Ariel. I thought it would make a cute short film. Simple as that. The story would become the documentary film Catfish , a reality thriller that shocked media and moviegoers alike when it premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. Within two months , Schulman became Facebook friends with a small throng of Abby's fans, followers and family, including her 19-year-old half-sister Megan. Like Schulman, she was a photographer and he was intrigued by the striking photos of herself which she posted online. She was smoking hot , unbelievably sexy ... super beautiful, Schulman said. Although they were complete strangers , he quickly fell for her. I was opening up to Megan in ways that I had not with actual girlfriends that I had had , he told 20 20.  ",

   "input": "Sunday, August 18th 1996, 2:00AM TONY BENNETT is a real troubadour. Look the word up in a dictionary and it means a wandering singer or minstrel , and does he ever qualify. For one thing , he never stops singing except maybe now and then, when he gets the urge to put his thoughts on canvas, in a painting. Bennett hardly ever stops traveling, either. But the other day, in town before heading to Atlantic City where he's appearing at Caesars right this minute he put the paintbrush down long enough to talk about what he's been doing lately. He went to California to open the Billboard Club on the Sunset Strip a new theme club , he explained , where I sang for 45 minutes. After that , Boston. I play at the Cape, Wolf Trap and the Garden State Arts Center [the PNC Bank Center, as it's now called]. Then of course, Caesars. You know , once you get on the road, you end up knowing no other way of life. Just two weeks ago , Bennett celebrated his 70th birthday at a party hosted by his son, Danny, and the guest list was impressive. There were of course his sons, Danny and Daegal, daughter Johanna, grandchildren Kelsey, Remy, Austin and Jared. There was Tony's sister Mary; fellow Queensite Jimmy Breslin; former Mayor David Dinkins and his wife, Joyce; Tommy Mattola, who runs the music end of Sony; Donald and Marla Trump; Regis and Joy Philbin; Helen Gurley and David Brown; Sumner Redstone, who runs Viacom, and painter Everett Raymond Kinstler, who's done portraits of presidents and of Katharine Hepburn. Among others. It was something. A lot of good friends , he said. But just the same , it was a strange party Bennett didn't have to sing a note. For a change, people sang to him. Singing is something that came so easily to him. From the time he was was able to talk, he was singing. He laughs when he thinks about his first public appearance. It was for the opening of the Triboro Bridge. The bridge went from Queens , where we lived, to the Bronx, and Mayor LaGuardia came to cut the ribbon. My uncle was commissioner for libraries in Queens , so he arranged for me to sing at the ribbon-cutting. So they dressed me in a little silk suit, and I sang 'Marching Along Together' for the mayor, then I had to walk all the way across the bridge with him, singing the song over and over again. You think I get tired of 'I Left My Heart in San Francisco'? Not nearly as tired as I was of 'Marching Along Together' after that day. Ralph Sharon , Bennett's pianist, is a long-standing friend they've won four Grammys in the last three years. They've been together 40 years, Bennett notes, and we do keep changing the program , adding some songs, eliminating others. Keep it fresh, new. Right now, we've added numbers from the most recent albums, 'Here's to the Ladies' and 'Fred Astaire Songs.' His new album will be songs associated with Billie Holliday. And if that wasn't enough , he has a book of his paintings due out shortly, called Tony Bennett: What My Heart Has Seen. Not bad for a wandering minstrel.  ",

   "input": "BY GEORGE RUSH AND JOANNA MOLLOY WITH KASIA ANDERSON Sunday, November 25th 2001, 2:24AM Hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons may have some explaining to do to Eddie Murphy.In his new memoir, Life and Def: Sex , Drugs, Money, + God, the Def Jam founder takes aim at the Dr. Doolittle star as having gone really Hollywood and becoming a recluse - contending that a lot of what's going on in the world outside his bubble is foreign to him. Simmons also says Murphy once told him that he didn't work with black directors because they don't have a big enough vision. Murphy's rep , Arnold Robinson, argues that Eddie makes a concerted effort to have African-Americans employed on all his movies , at all levels. Robinson admits Murphy goes out less now that he has a wife and kids , but he's not a recluse. (Indeed , how many superstars would give a lift to a hitchhiking transvestite prostitute at 4:45 a.m., as Murphy did in 1997?) As for Simmons, when we asked him about his Murphy comments at his book party the other night, he suffered a sudden bout of amnesia. Where did I say - in the book did I say that? asked Simmons , who collaborated with writer Nelson George on the volume. I think everybody's in touch right now , Simmons maintained at the party. Anybody who loses touch is insane , because everybody else is trying to get it. All the producers - when they're walking up and down the beach in Malibu - they're wishing they could understand what's going on in the street. Simmons also suggested rap godfathers such as Run-D.M.C. saved our culture from Michael Jackson. When Run-D.M.C. got on MTV , there was nobody black on there but Michael Jackson, Simmons told us. And he got his nose straightened and his hair straightened. And Run-D.M.C. got on and they said , 'No curls, no braids, peasy-head [unkempt hair] and still get paid.' Dust off your coonskin cap. Director Ron Howard needs men to defend the Alamo. Disney has enlisted Howard and screenwriter John Sayles to retell the story of the 1836 battle in which Texans defended their San Antonio fortress against Mexican Gen. Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana. (The 1960 United Artists film starred John Wayne as Davy Crockett and Richard Widmark as Jim Bowie.) Howard wants to capture the post-Sept. 11 surge in patriotism , a source tells us. John Sayles is a liberal , offbeat writer who may be taking a revisionist approach. But it's going to be about the martyrdom of Bowie and others. Howard's producer-partner , Brian Grazer, insists that the flick won't ally itself with Mexicans or Texans. It's not so much about patriotism as about individuals who take a stand , Grazer tells the L.A. Times , in an apparent effort to head off criticism from South of the Border. It's about how Americans struggled to survive. You could say it reminds us of who we are. They've weathered parenthood , a high-profile wedding and a world tour, but Madonna admitted that she and her Guy are worried about another joint venture: his remake of Swept Away. We kept saying this is gonna make or break our relationship , Mrs. Ritchie told the BBC. But we've said that about everything , about having a baby, getting married. 00c2 So far everything's been good. And Madge , who says she'd consider having more babies, has been practicing zen and the art of hunting since moving to England. When you're shooting , you are standing in the forest for really long periods of time, so you end up looking at the leaves and the sky and the trees, and you have a lot of time to meditate, she said. I eat birds. You have more of a respect for the things you eat when you go through or see the process of killing them. THE NEW issue of The Economist carries this correction: In the issues of Dec. 16 ,2000, to Nov. 10,2001, we may have given the impression that George Bush had been legally and duly elected president of the United States. We now understand that this may have been incorrect, and that the election result is still too close to call. The Economist apologizes for any inconvenience. 00c2 STEPHEN DALDRY , who directed Billy Elliot , has sent the British press into a tizzy by claiming to have gotten married here in New York. Daldry had been in a long-term relationship with another man , but he says shortly after Sept. 11 he married a New York lady named Lucy at City Hall. It was one of those moments when you have to decide and focus your life and take positive action when everything else seems to be falling apart , says Daldry in his interview with The Times. 00c2 THE ANNOUNCEMENT won't be made till next week , but we hear Penthouse's next Pet of the Year will be Megan Mason, a 24-year-old Texan who wants to pursue a Ph.D. in psychology - the better to understand the men who will hit on her. 00c2 JA RULE nabs Vibe Magazine's Artist of the Year award. The mag, out this week, names Jay-Z's The Blueprint as Album of the Year. Other winners include India.Arie , Missy Elliott, P. Diddy, OutKast, Sade and mixmasters the Neptunes.

Former Desperate Housewives co-star Nicollette Sheridan, who's suing show creator Marc Cherry for $20 million, has dropped her claim that Cherry slapped her across her face. While Sheridan's lawsuit is still in play -- she's also accusing Cherry and ABC of wrongful termination and sex and gender discrimination -- it's likely she has limited her potential damages by dropping the allegations of physical and emotional abuse. Sheridan filed papers in Los Angeles Superior Court last Friday, agreeing that she won't assert any claim for emotional or physical damages, according to The Hollywood Reporter. In return, ABC won't require Sheridan to undergo a mental or physical examination. Sheridan filed her original lawsuit last April, charging that Cherry forcefully hit her with his hand across her face and head. A month later , she amended the claim to assert it had only been a light tap. Sheridan ,47, played real estate agent and Wisteria Lane resident Edie Britt on Housewives from 2004-2009 , when she was dropped from the show.  ",

She 2019s a national curiosity at this point, but she doesn 2019t actually say anything bizarre. 201d Carey, meanwhile, has the potential to be an insightful judge, if she doesn 2019t go soft on the contestants. 201cShe will certainly be able to talk about how to improve a performance, and get into the technical stuff, 201d said Mandelker. 201cThe question is whether or not she 2019s just going to be praising every contestant with lavish words about butterflies and rainbows and charm bracelets. 201d Carey 2019s experience hosting bizarre late night shop-a-thons on QVC may actually come in handy for her 201cIdol 201d gig. 201cMariah 2019s had a history of meltdowns and she has a reputation of being a diva, so maybe she will bring a little bit of edge to the panel, 201d noted M.J. Santilli, self-described 201cIdol 201d fan girl and editor of mjsbigblog.com. 201cActually, I think that would be good for the show if Mariah is a little nutty. I think people love that. I think people loved Paula Abdul when she was a little off her rocker. Abdul , who set the standard for bizarre judging practices during her eight seasons on 201cAmerican Idol 201d and her brief tenure on X Factor may have been the blueprint for reality show producers hiring Spears and Carey. 201cPaula Abdul created the archetype of the sweet but crazy reality show judge , and we 2019ll always love her for that, 201d noted Mandelker, who also hosts a reality show podcast on iTunes. 201cI hope that Britney can bring some kooky behavior to 2018X Factor 2019 and be what Paula Abdul was in her heyday. 201d After two seasons of bland observations from judges Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler on 201cAmerican Idol, 201d experts tell FOXNews.com that new blood was desperately needed on the judging panel. 201cA judge should not only know music and understand performances, but they have to be able to articulate what made a performance strong or weak, 201d said Mandelker. 201cI think the problem with Steven Tyler and Jennifer Lopez was that they had the same critiques week after week after week, and that 2019s what really made them bad judges. 201d 201cJLo and Steven shied away from being really honest with contestants, maybe because they were afraid that people wouldn 2019t buy their records or go to their concerts, 201d said Santilli. 201cI think it 2019s kind of hard for an artist who 2019s out there, trying to be popular, to sit on a panel and be critical. There 2019s a risk there that you might turn people off. 201d Which may be why behind-the-scenes players seem to make the best judges on 201cAmerican Idol. 201d 201cI would love it if they found someone like Jimmy Iovine to be on the panel, 201d noted Santilli. 201cSomebody who is an insider 2013a record executive or a manager 2013someone who is really willing to tell it like it is. I don 2019t think that kinder, gentler panel really worked for 2018Idol. 2019 201d 201cI think 2018Idol 2019 has a great judge there with Jimmy Iovine, 201d added Rushfield. 201cUnfortunately, he 2019s sidelined and not a part of the judges 2019 panel. But his post-game comments have been terrific and it 2019s just a tragedy that you hear them the next day 2013and not when they can inject some actual drama into the show. 201d In any case, 201cIdol 201d fans will be watching this fall, or at least watching the premiere. 201cI always watch at the beginning 2013I always give it a chance, 201d said Rushfield. 201cBut I don 2019t see that they 2019ve produced a game-changer yet. I 2019m waiting to see that still. 201d  ",

Galicia has a Celtic history (which may or may not explain the bagpipe) and its own language (related to Portuguese) and culture.

Which makes Galicia a natural for 201cChristmas Revels. 201d 201cThe Road to Compostela 201d includes three Catalan carols, a Spanish lullaby, and a motet by the 16th-century Spanish composer Francisco Guerrero, but the majority of the 23 tracks come from the host region.

There are lively villancicos navide 00f1os, or Christmas carols; there 2019s a carol of the Three Kings in which the Revels Children ask for pesetas; there 2019s a hymn to the Black Madonna of Guadalupe, who 2019s seen walking barefoot on the beach in the Galician port city of Rianxo. Most of the carols concern the Nativity. One of the disc 2019s highlights, however, is a love song, 201cOndas do Mar de Vigo 201d ( 201cWaves of the Sea of Vigo 201d), by the 13th-century Galician composer Mart 00edn C 00f3dax, sung wistfully by Jamie Jaffe. And high-spirited dances are performed by a Pilgrim Band of gaitas, drums, tambourine, castanets, harp, guitar, Baroque violin, and viola da gamba. It all ends with the 201cTravellers 2019 Carol, 201d Susan Cooper 2019s translation of a Catalan original, in which the pilgrims 201cjoin hands in greeting 201d and 201crejoice together at the new year 2019s turning. 201d Like just about every Revels release, this one is cause for rejoicing.

   "input": "It was a cool December morning in 2007 when junior Ryan D. entered my office and announced: That's two weeks straight! I looked at the clock and it read 8 a.m. He was right on time once again. It wasn't always like that. Ryan struggled for the first two years of high school. A close member of his family passed away his freshman year, he lost interest in school and his grades plummeted. He was raised solely by his dedicated mother, and commuted nearly an hour to school each day. Ryan sneaked by, and he was infamous for arriving late and being an underachiever. I met Ryan in September 2007. It was my first year at the Academy of Urban Planning in Brooklyn, N.Y., and I would be his guidance counselor. Ryan was quiet, unassuming and seemed harmless enough. I optimistically assumed that we'd bond right away, but that was clearly a rookie mistake. I hadn't heard about his reputation, but soon learned it was true. In the first month, Ryan was constantly late and was the antithesis of a morning person. He was often straight faced, distant and unmotivated. I met with him. I met with his mother. We created action plans, contracts, and I even bought him an alarm clock. Nothing seemed to work. Ultimatums were ignored, encouragement was dismissed, and my alarm clock gift was thrown out the window, literally. Ryan failed most of his morning classes, but excelled once he woke up. He aced exams, papers, and standardized tests with minimal studying. In fact, he would later record the highest SAT score in the school. He was truly gifted, if only he took school more seriously. During his free time in class, Ryan was a voracious reader. He finished class work quickly, and then simply took out a book, magazine, or newspaper to read. It was common to see Ryan's face hidden behind The New York Times or Sports Illustrated. Ryan's other true love was basketball. When he discovered that I was the junior varsity basketball coach, a bond started to form. Eleventh graders could not be on the team, but he still attended practices and games just to watch and be a part of something. We spoke daily about our NBA idols. For him, it was Steve Nash, and for me it was Larry Bird. Something clicked during these talks. It was like discovering that we both spoke the same language. Our conversations no longer hovered around improvement plans and academic goal setting. Instead, we talked about the sanctity of basketball. As we reveled about game winning shots, no look passes, and fade-away three pointers, all of the problems in his life, and in my life, seemed to fade away. Basketball broke down those walls and brought us together. It was during one of our basketball discussions that we came to an agreement. Ryan would arrive to school on time for one month straight, and as a reward, I would take him to his first ever NBA game. He looked me in the eyes, flashed a rare smile, and shook my hand in agreement. Each day going forward, Ryan popped into my office to declare his punctuality. He'd either announce what day he was on or simply say: I got this , Cooley. His morning teachers were so surprised by his presence that they assumed there was a mistake with the clocks. Ryan fulfilled his 30-day promise , and on March 29, 2008 we attended his first ever NBA game. The Phoenix Suns and Steve Nash were in town to play the New Jersey Nets at the Izod Center. Ryan's eyes lit up as we saw the action up close and took in the NBA experience. We even snuck down a few sections to get a better view of the game. Steve Nash didn't have his best performance, but still dished out 11 assists, and Ryan elbowed me each time to remind me. The Suns were victorious, and so was Ryan. Attending the game may have been the reward, but the true victory was seeing his grades and confidence increase over that time. He never hit the snooze button again. In December 2007, the Celtics were gearing up for a championship run, the Nets were still in New Jersey, Steve Nash was an all-star and Ryan was a struggling high school student. In 2014, things had changed. The Celtics were now playing for the lottery. The Nets were now in Brooklyn, and Steve Nash was struggling to remain healthy and stay in the NBA. But during all of the changes, there was one constant: Ryan and I kept going to one NBA game together each year. Every year it gave us a chance to reconnect. And every year, I was updated on Ryan's progress. In his senior year of high school, Ryan passed all of his classes, came out of his shell, and even emerged as an all-star on the debate team. He graduated from high school on time, and enrolled at a local community college, and achieved a 4.0 GPA. He even took morning classes. Apparently, his alarm clock was never thrown out the window again. Ryan and I attended our seventh NBA game together on March 21, 2014. This year we watched my Boston Celtics get trounced by the Brooklyn Nets. While Brooklyn schooled Boston on the court, Ryan and I caught up and reflected about the past seven years. We joked about alarm clocks, morning classes and past basketball games. Ryan caught me up on his life too. He is nearly finished with his bachelor's degree from John Jay College. He is majoring in English, on the dean 2019s list, writes for the school paper and has a serious girlfriend. Like I said before, things had changed. This year's game was especially memorable. Afterwards, we met up with Ryan's girlfriend and his mother, whom I hadn't seen since graduation. We shared smiles and hugs and stories. We reminisced about the past and spoke about the future. There was a sense of pride and hope as if we all went through this journey together, and Ryan was the centerpiece. It was like we had won the title. There are times when a team is counted out. There are times when people are counted out. These are the underdogs. People lose hope, but I never do. And once in a while, we are rewarded for our faith and become a part of something that we'll never forget. Like us on facebook, follow us on twitter, and subscribe to our YouTube channel.  ",

The Nerdist reported Wednesday that the show 2019s producers offered Zero Dark Thirty star Jessica Chastain a spot in the 2015 season. But reps for Chastain and HBO denied the rumor, according to E! News. Sadly, Chastain will not join the show. Bring on Chastain would have been a boon for the series. Not only did Chastain storm the film industry in 2011 with starring roles in a total of seven films, she also earned a host of awards and nominations for her role as a determined CIA officer in 2012 2032s Zero Dark Thirty, including an Oscar nod. (She was also included in the 2012 TIME 100.) Critics of the show, who thought that it was misogynist and gave no female perspective, have also been eager to see a woman in one of the lead roles for the second season.

The 35-year-old Californian 2019s 2010 single I Need a Dollar was not only a massive seller, but also was featured as the theme for the HBO series How to Make it in America. His soaring vocal on Swedish DJ Avicii 2019s smash Wake Me Up was as ubiquitous last summer as sunshine. Since then, apart from releasing new album Lift Your Spirit and advising Adam Levine 2019s team on the hit US television series The Voice, Blacc has worked as a brand collaborator with the Lincoln Motor Company, creating original videos and lending the Ford subsidiary some of his suave, urbane cool. During a visit to New York, Blacc sat to discuss his musical inspirations, his uncannily reserved vehicular tastes and his tips for getting out of traffic tickets. Brett Berk: You 2019ve mentioned Sly and the Family Stone, Marvin Gaye and Jimi Hendrix among the greatest influences on your work. Who else is in heavy rotation on your headphones? Aloe Blacc: There's an artist by the name of Eugene McDaniels who put out two fantastic albums in the early 201870s, and I listen to those pretty religiously, because the lyrics are very heavy. Very political 2013 I think to the point where the Nixon administration banned his album. There's another fantastic soul gospel artist from that same era, early 201870s, named DJ Rogers, who released, in my opinion, his seminal work, It's Good to Be Alive. And that was a very happy, uplifting, joyful album. That inspired what I'm doing with Lift Your Spirit, an album that really speaks to the positivity in life, despite the challenges and obstacles. You grew up in southern California. When did you learn to drive? When I turned 16, I inherited the family minivan. And I drove that to school, and trips up to LA with friends to go to clubs. My dad enjoyed having cars, and I can count about 13 different vehicles we had through my childhood. To this day, he still owns four different vehicles: a minivan, an SUV, an RV and an 201880s sports car. Did you buy something special when you signed your first contract? I've always been conscious of having something that felt right for me, but also, like my dad, finding the right price. So when I signed to an indie label back in 2005, I was able to find myself a nice, used Infiniti coupe. But I parked it in the wrong neighborhood one night, and when I returned it was gone. And when the police found it, it was pretty much stripped and useless at that point. The wheels on those cars are a popular target, for some reason. That's actually what they took! After that, I ended up getting a Volvo 850. A sedan. And I still own that. I kept it. And my wife kept saying, 201cWell, we signed a major recording deal, we have money to spend. Why don't you get a new car that's comfortable? 201d That's really what it's about for us, comfort, and quality, and knowing that you're going to arrive safely. So I said 201cWell, why don't I get you a car? 201d And we picked the Ford Fusion Hybrid. And we're really happy with that. Then, working with Interscope, I had the opportunity to partner with Lincoln, and I thought, beautiful. I'm familiar with the Ford family, I like the vehicles, let's do something that's crafted correctly for my art and my presentation. The character I've presented is largely thanks to my dad, who always said to look nice, to always dress well. So you'll find most of my photos in a suit, or a blazer and tie. You can't really knock something that's classy. What form has your Lincoln relationship taken so far? We put together this beautiful music video for the song Love Is the Answer 2013 for me, the most important message on my album. We had this awesome location in Los Angeles, where we shot a video that allows the viewer to choose one of four different points of view, four different story lines, as I sing and dance through this building from the rooftop down to the bottom floor, and get inside my Lincoln [MKZ sedan] and drive away. Is it safe to assume you are driving a Lincoln these days? I'll be in the MKC when I finish this tour with Bruno Mars. What 2019s the most embarrassing thing that's ever happened to you in a car? I was driving through Hollywood, on Sunset Boulevard, and I mistakenly ran a red light. It was an honest mistake. But a cop pulled me over, and he came up to the window and he said, 201cDid you know you ran a red light? 201d And I said, 201cYeah. I was afraid that the car behind me was going to hit me. 201d Which 2026 could have been true. And he said, 201cOK, well, you know, just be careful next time. 201d And he let me go. As I'm on my way home, I got on the 101 freeway. I have some friends who are graffiti artists. And they're really good graffiti artists 2013 they've actually graduated from street graffiti to MoMA and MoCA and all these big museums. And they 2019d painted a billboard for me, of my likeness, to promote my album, and you could only see it from the 101. So, I decided that I was going to stop and take a photo of this billboard. I pulled over to the side of the freeway, cars were buzzing by. And as I was opening my door, a cop pulled up behind me. And I was thinking, 201cOh, no. For sure I'm going to get a ticket this time. 201d There 2019s no way you can be pulled over twice within the same 10-minute span. So I got out of the car, and the cop walked up. And it's the same exact police officer. And he's like, 201cWhat are you doing now? 201d And I looked at him like, there's no way I can really talk myself out of this one. So I said, 201cYou know what, I just wanted to take a picture of that billboard over there. 201d And I pointed at it, and he looked at the billboard, and he looked back at me, and he said, 201cHurry up and take your picture and get off the freeway! 201d And so, since then, I've had tremendous respect for LA police officers.

   "input": "Francesca Grillo and Sharrine Scholtz do a sweet line in awkward evasiveness. Coy references to their previous employers abound. And when I first ask about one of those ex-bosses 2013 a certain Charles Saatchi 2013 Grillo demurs: I'd rather not talk about him, if you don't mind. We meet at an art ball in a private members' club above a Fulham pub , but all three of us are keen to avoid a cha-cha-cha tutorial, so we retire downstairs to waltz around two elephants in the room instead. Grillo, along with her older sister Elisabetta, was unceremoniously sacked as Nigella Lawson's personal assistant after being accused of 00a3685,000 of credit-card fraud. Both Italians were found not guilty last year following a sensational trial. Scholtz, meanwhile, who appeared as a defence witness for the Grillos, testified that she was forced out of Saatchi's office , where she had worked for up to 19 hours a day as an accounts assistant, after accusations (strongly denied) of stealing from petty cash and taking unauthorised taxis. She described her decision to give evidence as career suicide. You might think the pair would be seeking new lives in a world far away from Saatchi's 2013 as teachers , perhaps, or maybe civil servants. Instead they've chosen to launch their own art company. I've always been interested in art , Grillo ,35, insists. It's nothing to do with my previous employer. It's just a coincidence. They came up with the idea in 2011 , having made friends in Saatchi and Lawson's Belgravia mansion 2013 Grillo based in the kitchen, Scholtz in the art collector's basement office, where she worked for five years until 2009. The pair's new venture (like an abstract Factory 2013 a bit like what Warhol did) will see them put on pop-up exhibitions , art sales and collaborations with other creative forces , including music dance and theatre across London when they launch later this year. They have struggled to woo artists , who are terrified of crossing Saatchi. But Scholtz says there are more people who are supportive than those who are running scared. And they have achieved a coup in recruiting Tessa Farmer , whose insect-carcass creations 2013 as their website subtly points out 2013 are in the Saatchi Gallery's collection. They won't be representing artists, merely collaborating, but other names already signed up include Canadian Natasha Bailey, who uses performance to explore her symptoms associated with post-traumatic stress disorder in a humorous and light-hearted way; sculptor , painter, print-maker and photographer Wayne Chisnall; Pierluigi Catilli, who has created an immersive theatre piece for their first exhibition; and taxidermist Adele Morse. The outfit's name, Laissez Faire Art, is all about the idea of not being confined or dictated to , says Scholtz. Artists having the freedom to be themselves.They describe themselves on Twitter as trouble-makers with a splash of colour. Grillo's barrister said in court that she and her sister had been lambs in the centre of two more devouring animals. After the mauling they got in the tabloids , does she want to set the record straight? Well, actually, no. To be honest , Grillo says , once the rumours are out there , they don't change their minds. People will have to meet me. And I can't go out and meet every single human that reads the Daily Mail or any of the gossip columns. Some people will see I'm sincere and that I was innocent, 2013 I am innocent 2013 and some people will maybe think I'm an opportunist social climber. But at least I provoke feelings! People either love me or hate me 2013 I'm like Marmite. Elisabetta Grillo collapsed several times during the trial and suffered from constant panic attacks. Her sister reveals she is still having treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder , but is now taking after Lawson in pursuing cookery (she is a natural , apparently, and never needs to rely on a recipe). Whereas you need Nigella's cookbooks? I ask , cheekily. There is a dramatic pause, before she responds with a straight face. Er , I kind of like Jamie Oliver. I like his 15-minute recipes 2013 they're so easy to follow and not too expensive. Grillo says she has to watch the pennies because she has no job besides establishing the yet-to-launch art company. So how is she surviving financially? It's very challenging , but I manage, she says. You can live on very little , to be honest. Really? In London? From Monday to Friday , I don't do lunches, she claims. What about rent? Oh , I share with my sister, so it's fine. She has recently upgraded to a bed after two years on the sofa. When I had to leave 2013 you know , when all this started 2013 my sister only had that to give to me. It's a far cry from her ex-bosses' luxurious lifestyle. But Grillo (described by Lawson as the cleaner who never had to clean) is excited about normality. I remember the first time I started taking the tube 2013 I got lost. I like that , I never used to meet normal people. Lots of people want an exciting and an exclusive life 2013 but the truth is you are so much better off being normal. The only challenge is if you go for a job interview: obviously Google doesn't forgive. There's no way to escape that. Grillo has a keen sense of humour. When she mentions that , like her sister, she has been suffering from PTSD, I wonder if she's joking. But she isn't. She says the trauma has manifested itself in an aversion to ice cream, which triggers memories of the painful period when she was evicted from Team Cupcake. Nigella was working on her book and had just made a salted caramel dressing for her ice cream. I think about that. Ice cream? No , thank you. Is it true that Saatchi still has a pending civil case against Grillo and her sister? I can't talk about it , unfortunately, she says , before adding: In a few months' time , I'll be able to talk more 2026 Their launch party hopefully won't be the last you hear from us , promises the art world's newest fixture. In a positive way. Not involving lawyers.  ",

That gives only the mildest taste of the rich masala of flavours flung into the pot by India's leading modern painter, Bhupen Khakhar. There are examples of Khakhar's work in all of the world's major modern art museums, yet the artist, now in his late 60s, has never had a big solo exhibition in this country. The Lowry presents four decades of painting that plot a course from primitivism to Pop, mistily perceived through a haze of eroticism. The bold, blocky organisations of Khakhar's early compositions resemble eastern homages to Henri Rousseau, while his industrial crowd scenes look like oriental Lowrys with the colour control turned up. Like a true faux-naive painter, Khakhar kept his day job. Even after gaining international recognition, he continued to work as a chartered accountant. The tensions emanating from this split personality are closer to the surface of the paintings from the 1980s, when Khakhar began to expose himself - literally. In the pivotal masterpiece You Can't Please All, the artist depicts himself naked, bending over a balcony to survey episodes from a Hindu folk tale about two men selling their donkey. The animal, you cannot help but notice, has an enormous erection. This coded declaration of homosexuality unleashed a whole new priapic energy in Khakhar's work. Khakhar came out in style - his post-1980s output is full of rejuvenated old men enjoying congress with mightily aroused angels or multiple-limbed Hindu gods. One of these features a squatting, guru-like figure with five penises. Some people have condemned this as obscene. I'd call him fortunate. After all this fragrantly spiced eroticism, the final room, dark and violent, comes as a bit of a shock. Perhaps in response to treatment for cancer, Khakhar becomes hyper-aware of his own mortality. In one very black diptych, a figure shoots his companion at point-blank range: proof, if it were needed, that even chartered accountants can turn ugly. Until January 5. Details: 0161-876 2000.  ",

This has something to do with scale and style, the way that his pictures, like theirs, are at their best in big, white, loft-like rooms. But it is mostly to do with the way they make me feel. Sit in front of one of Innes's Exposed Paintings and you feel meditative to the point of not quite being able to struggle to your feet. It occurs to you that you might easily stay put all day, thinking your own dark thoughts and, possibly, taking the odd nap. His work, like that of Rothko and Newman, seems almost to emit a bat-like hum, so subtle is it in its construction, so strangely intense in its effect. It is not exciting, then, so much as immobilising. But is this a good thing or bad? Is Innes's work a balm for the urban soul or the painterly equivalent of Mogadon? I only wish I could be certain. My hunch is that a really huge gathering of his work would confirm the former view. But this show, in the upstairs galleries at Modern Art Oxford, is on a more boutique scale, making judgment just that little bit trickier. Time is on your side - you can walk the entire space in less than 15 minutes - but it's also difficult to know how representative a sample this collection is (which is why it is worth buying the beautiful book that accompanies the exhibition; it includes plates of many more pictures than you can see in the gallery and the effect is impressive). Still, there is plenty to admire. The quality of the light in the gallery is fantastic and the space, midweek, never gets too crowded. Though there are notices everywhere warning you how fragile Innes's work is, telling you that it must not be touched, you can get pleasingly intimate with the paintings, scrutinising his technique. It involves the removal as well as the application of paint. And this is when it really starts to comes alive, when you realise how complex it is. Innes, born in 1962, studied drawing and painting at Gray's School of Art, Aberdeen, and then at Edinburgh College of Art. Then, he was immersed largely in figurative work. Since the late Eighties, however, his creative dynamic has been, as writer Richard Cork has put it, 'bound up with the need for subtraction'. What this means is that he pits paint against turpentine or shellac. But one does not cancel the other out entirely; rather, it leaves behind the memory of what was there before, hence the show's title. The work captures the transience of creativity even as it renders it permanent. Innes has spoken of a crucial moment during the making of his work when the surface of the canvas starts to move and flow. Now, he might mean this literally: turps, after all, works on paint in a physical, chemical way, smudging it like dirt on a window. But it also, surely, refers to something more conceptual: the point at which the painting's emotional life begins. Perhaps this sounds pretentious. It is, a little. But once you understand what he's up to, the paintings have possibilities. They stop seeming so crowd-pleasingly decorative. His big blocks of colour, attacked by the turps, start to look like shadows, or sheets of rain, or mascara-heavy tears. From Memory covers the last 15 years of Innes's career, in other words, from the time just before he was shortlisted for the Turner Prize in 1993. The show kicks off with From Memory 1989, a sketchbook drawing of a leaf whose image has been sunk on to corrugated brown cardboard. This, you gather, was a breakthrough picture for Innes, but it now seems atypical; it's just a little prissy. There then follows a middle section, in which you can see the smaller shellac paintings - they remind me of old-fashioned flypaper, black paint stuck to them in the manner of marooned insects - and some vast black canvases with streaks of colour on them, like light appearing through a crack in a door. But the exhibition's climax is to be found in the final gallery: a series of canvases entitled Exposed Painting, Dioxazine Violet. This is mature work; it has a real sense of authority and not only because Innes has used a paint colour that brings papal robes irresistibly to mind. I love the way these works talk to each other, each of them subtly different from the last. They form an echo chamber of colour and mood. One half of the painting shouts to another, but all that comes back - after Innes has set about it with his oily chemical - is a kind of ghostly cry. Stare at them for long enough and their murkiest corners start to resemble a shroud imprinted with the memory of what lay on it. Or perhaps this is just an over-the-top way of saying that their image stays with you long after you have left them. 00b7 Laura Cumming is away  ",

   "input": "The space in which we eat can have a powerful effect on what is on our plate. Of course, a meal in uncomfortable surroundings is never going to be entirely fulfilling, but it goes much further than that. The formality or informality of the setting, the colour of the walls, the way our seat faces, even the way the light falls on our plate will all have an effect on our meal. At home we have a choice whether we eat in cosy clutter or spartan simplicity or somewhere between the two. We can make our own mind up whether to close the blinds or lower the lights. But in public spaces, be they restaurants or airports, art galleries or simply corner caffs, it is up to someone else to make those decisions for us. Anyone who designs a public eating space has to consider what is going to please the majority of users. This could, and often does, result in the bland and boring, yet more and more public spaces are becoming a pleasure to eat in. For this we have to thank the vision of the architects and those who back their flights of fancy. I have always wondered how those who are paid to consider the aesthetics of our public eating spaces eat and cook in their own homes. What are their kitchens like and how does their work relate to the home space? Once Richard Rogers had designed the River Caf 00e9 with his trademarks of space and light, and Frank Gehry had woven his sensuous minimalism on New York's Cond 00e9 Nast staff canteen, it opened up a world of opportunity for architects to get involved in eating spaces. We asked a host of famous architects where they felt good food and aesthetics meet. Daniel Libeskind gives us a glimpse of his Manhattan kitchen, Thomas Heatherwick shows off his outstanding new beachfront caf 00e9 in Littlehampton and David Chipperfield welcomes us into his Galician villa.Nigel Slater Lord Rogers of Riverside has previously worked alongside Norman Foster and Renzo Piano. In the last two years he has received the Pritzker and Stirling prizes. His previous projects include the Millennium Dome, the Pompidou Centre in Paris, the National Assembly for Wales and the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. He is married to the Michelin-starred Ruth Rogers of the River Caf 00e9. Being the son of an Italian mother is a problem because Italian mothers don't allow their males to cook. Especially in my generation. I have five boys who cook, and I'm the only one that doesn't, I just eat. I'm the one let-down of the family. I was born in Florence and, culturally, I am Italian. It's very much in my blood. I try to spend as much time in Italy as I can - about seven weeks in total each year. My mother was a really good cook, an Italian Triestine. Their kitchen in England was probably the first I ever designed. Young architects have to start somewhere and it's usually the kitchens that need modernising. At our house, close to Pienza, there's an amazing wood oven and outdoor grill. We have competitions for pizza-making with any friends or family who happen to be staying. Just the decoration part, as long as Ruthie supplies the ingredients. All the sons, wives and grandchildren come and visit. There's often 20 for lunch. I always work on holiday, early in the morning. I have various memories of looking out of my parents' house when I was about four or five and seeing a chair and a table put out for the local accountant. I thought, that's the idea, doing your business in a cafe, first thing in the day. I haven't quite got there but I'm pretty close to it. I probably eat, do business, or just come and taste things in the River Caf 00e9 every day. It's an extension of the community that I'm part of. The space outside even more so. I've been very fortunate. It was nothing to start off with. When the opportunity came up, the partnership bought the warehouses and we thought what a good idea to have a little restaurant. There were tremendous planning restrictions so it started as a canteen with sandwiches and came up from that. Ruthie's experience is purely domestic, that's why it's always been a hands-on, chef-led kitchen; and I've known Rose Gray [co-head chef at the River Caf 00e9] since she was 18. I don't choose the menus but we discuss food a lot. When we were completing the Pompidou and there was no other work coming in, Renzo Piano, Ruthie and I thought of writing a book called Sex, Food and Architecture. So it was very important to us, even then. We would often talk about the relationship between food and architecture. Food has the advantage of being more immediate. But they are both about a better quality of life. France in the Seventies was leading the way with its markets and atmosphere. Things have moved on to Spain and Italy because they offer simpler food and ways of cooking it. Renzo is my closest friend. I'll see him in 10 days' time for his 70th birthday, and a week later in Genoa. We do a lot of talking. I think Britain has changed radically in the last 20 years. It was very behind in terms of its food and now it's as good as anywhere, especially London. I'm a chief adviser to the mayor and we are on the way to giving London the best public spaces of any city. The street is the heart of the public domain and it's very much anchored by restaurants, cafes and benches, which you enjoy on a sunny day. I'm all for not having an urban sprawl. I like places you can walk to. Cities are for the meeting of people, that's what it should be about. A friendly environment. David Chipperfield (CBE) went solo in 1984 after working for Richard Rogers and Norman Foster. Most of his work is in Germany, America and the Far East, but he has also designed a restaurant for Wagamama and the British Film Institute. Two new UK projects include art galleries in Wakefield and Margate. People have different attitudes to cooking, and when you do a kitchen you have to design for the way they live. Now it is accepted that you spend a lot of time in the kitchen so you can give it as much attention as other rooms. It's no longer about being at the back of house. I like a kitchen in the middle of the house, whereas some people like to tuck them away. At the house in Spain it was fundamental that the kitchen was in the living space. I cook every night at 10 o'clock for seven or eight weeks in the summer. Normally it's for about 20 and I do a pot of something using shells like crab or mussels. Galicia is famous for shells. I have about eight recipes that I use when cooking for large numbers. Many recipes started with Ruthie Rogers at the River Cafe and then got adapted for a large group of people. Galicia is famous in Spain for its fish and as the largest consumer of octopus in the world. In the old days we used to buy the fish straight off the boats. The fishermen give us things now and again but they're not really allowed to any more. It's all got to be taken to the market to be regulated. It's a very primitive part of the country and the weather is unpredictable, like a very warm Cornwall but without all the people. We invite lots - clients, and people from the office. Positioning kitchens in galleries and museums isn't really about cooking; it's about commercial criteria and whether they want the restaurants to be accessed independently to operate beyond the hours of the museum. In Germany there's an anxiety that the restaurant shouldn't be the first thing you see, whereas in England there's this commercial fear that if you don't see the restaurant you won't know it's there. You have to create an atmosphere in restaurants with a bit of complexity. The Ivy is a good example but I wouldn't necessarily have done it that way. I designed a Wagamama on Lexington Street in Soho for Alan Yau - I'm a big fan of his, I like Busaba Eathai. Most people tend to stick to four or five restaurants and I'm loyal to Jeremy King and Alan Yau. I also did a Nobu in Miami, Circus in Soho, and the restaurant in the Bryant Park Hotel in New York. I'm doing a museum in Anchorage, Alaska. We were fishing once and a guy caught a salmon, grilled it there and then, but covered it in barbecue sauce and ruined it. In America they have a tendency to smother things. I do a lot of travelling and if I'm in St Louis or Barcelona it's inevitable you end up going to dinner with a client. I've become slightly jaded because when you go to lots of nice restaurants you get spoilt and you can't savour it in the same way. I don't think that the best food I ever tasted was in a restaurant. Will Alsop (OBE) is the founder of SMC Alsop. In 2000 he won the Stirling Prize for the Peckham Library. He has practices in Beijing, London, Shanghai and Singapore. Architects don't build many buildings. When you have a commission you're going to have a relationship with that client for up to five years, so you've got to be able to sit at a table together. I'm obsessed with tables in one way or another. There are things that you'd say and do around a table that you wouldn't do if it wasn't there: it's the function that interests me. I've been thinking about a table with a sculpted surface so you can actually serve the food straight on to the table. Then you'd have a slit down the middle where you can fit the waste sack and wipe food over it. I have designed it, but it would be extremely expensive to make. Many ideas stick in the back of my mind and when the time is right they'll come out. Maybe in a better form. I don't deal with names but many of my buildings are given them, which is fine. A new housing project in Manchester is called Chips because it looks like three chips on top of each other. It's in three chips because it's a nine-storey building and if you do it as a slab it just looks like a nine-storey slab. I often get accused of being too fun but what's wrong with that? There's no intellectual basis for trying to dismiss something as being merely fun. The converse of fun is boredom, misery or sadness. Will that make the world a better place? I don't think so, but there's a lot of it about. I like unlikely combinations and the element of surprise is vastly underrated in architecture. People like to turn a corner and go, What on earths that? What I like about Baltic is walking through a pair of curtains into a very mysterious dark space which opens up into a very light space. It's not over-designed and at the same time not austerely minimal, which would get on my nerves. I'm austerely maximal. It was a genuine discovery for me when I was doing the Palestra building opposite. Ill usually order borscht, and they do very good liver. Its a winter cuisine really because in the Baltic they have a long winter. Magical summers, but they are short. I'm a die-hard smoker. In Toronto, where I work regularly, smoking has been banned for a lot longer than here. Each year it gets more and more draconian. When I first went there you were only allowed to smoke on what they called the patio. Then they decided even if the patio has a protective roof over it of less than 4.5 metres, which is quite high, you're still not allowed to smoke there either. So, the enlightened restaurants raise their roofs if they can, but that's not always possible. In Manchester there's a bar called Dukes 92 and they've got a huge patio with awnings and heaters which could probably seat 500 people. Now that's a response to the smoking ban. 00b7 Baltic Restaurant, 74 Blackfriars Road, London SE1; 020 7928 1111; www.balticrestaurant.co.uk Amanda Levete worked for Richard Rogers and Will Alsop in the Eighties. In 1989 she became one half of Future Systems whose most notable projects include Selfridges, Birmingham, and the NatWest Media Centre at Lord's Cricket Ground, which won the Stirling Prize in 1999. An architect can get a lot of work done in a restaurant. I bring my team from the office here if we have something to celebrate, or I bring a client, or I just come with my boyfriend. Eating is all about communication and exchanging ideas. There's a big blurring in my life between work and pleasure. It all merges into one and the restaurant is the venue for that. When I started working for Richard Rogers, the River Caf 00e9 was like our canteen. At first I'd take my mum there for a cheap bowl of soup but within months it had completely taken off. As it became more successful they'd do special deals for those who worked there and then you'd have to eat at slightly odd times. I've got all Ruth's cookbooks and use them a lot. Richard's a lovely man. In most of the restaurants I frequent, there's a design work connection. The director of Scott's, Mark Hix asked us to do a number of pieces: the crustacean holder, the champagne trolley and buckets, and the washbasins. With product design there's always a specific function: it's very exact. Other issues are its sculptural presence and ergonomic function. With a trolley, it has to be something that you can manipulate easily between tables and not take up too much room. Originally, Jeremy King commissioned us to do the trolley for the Ivy and the buckets for Le Caprice. With design you can explore the geometries and push the aesthetic in a way that you're not always able to with a building, because of the technical and functional constraints. Also, the return on your investment is four months. A building takes a long, painful, but rewarding, four years. The ground floor of Selfridges has got an oyster bar, a patisserie and a deli counter, and it has very much become the place to meet. Eating in a shop is very different from eating in a restaurant. You don't want to dwell. It was really important for us to provide a space in which you could feel equally comfortable with a small group or by yourself. Therefore we designed these petals that mean you can sit alone, or opposite one another. The ethos of the food hall was that it had a market feel. There aren't shelves. Everything is casually laid out, and low-slung, like a Moroccan market. The design is totally open and fluid. I'm doing a private house in Dublin where the couple entertain on quite a large scale. We're doing all the furniture and cutlery so it's almost like a restaurant: it's about creating a quality and a presence that's comfortable but at the same time architecturally exciting. I've always wanted to design a restaurant and you bet I'd do the interior. For me I don't understand how you can separate the inside from the outside. Once we did a proposal with restaurateur Alan Yau for Battersea Power Station before it was sold. Alan had this great idea to cross a nightclub with a restaurant and brothel. It was going to be a 24-hour operation where you could rent booths by the hour. It was a wild brief and that extracted a wild proposal from us. I have favourite dishes at Scott's. The stone-bass ceviche served with deep-fried plantain, the Dover sole and the sea bream. There used to be a cod's tongue starter, and I should ask Mark why they took it off. I don't feel guilty about eating anything. I love dark chocolate, but prefer to have a starter and a main, and then a chocolate truffle with a coffee. I never get sick of eating out but I'm not adventurous. I like to be introduced to places but I'll naturally go to ones I know. 00b7 Scott's, 20 Mount Street, London W1; 020 7495 7309; www.scotts-restaurant.com Sir Terry Farrell has had his own practice for over 40 years. His London projects include Embankment Place, the MI6 headquarters, and the Greenwich Peninsula masterplan, currently under way. In 2004 he was made the 'design champion' for Edinburgh to advise on future development of the city. Nicknames for buildings is a new thing and a lot are connected to food: the 'gherkin', the 'cheese-grater'. A pair of tall buildings in Chicago which have circular balconies going around were very quickly called the 'corncobs'. The only nicknames buildings used to have were derogatory ones. You could have easily called the gherkin the 'cruise missile'. I believe a lot of architects invent the names at the time of design because an association with a smaller, familiar object makes it instantly cuddly and loveable. When I did Embankment Place it could never be given a simple name because it's a more complex kind of building. Whereas today, buildings look more like one-liners: they can be technologically much more sophisticated but there's a slight dumbing-down of the language. As design champion for Edinburgh, I've had catered dinners in our apartment on York Place with MSPs, council leaders and other senior people. I do like to approve the menu in advance but not as much as my secretaries. They get terribly excited and worked-up about these things. And there's all sorts of protocol these days. Are they vegetarian? Any nut allergies? Once upon a time you were grateful for whatever you were given. Delikatesn is a tiny corner place down some stairs in New Town and, if it weren't for the menu they left us, I don't think I'd ever have found it. It's like a home from home because I live next to a great Portuguese deli in London. My home is above the office in an old furniture factory on Lisson Grove, NW1. I once had a party for 150 people and the Spanish restaurant across the road brought in big pans of paella. It's called Don Pepe's but we call it the canteen. I subsidise a happy hour for the staff there on Friday nights. I like local businesses. Particularly in my area, which always needs a bit of support. In the course of an architectural career there are kitchens of all kinds. The conference centre in Edinburgh I designed takes 1,000 people, so the kitchen's right next to the dining area for a fast turnaround. I once did an extension to Rules restaurant in Covent Garden. I think it's the oldest restaurant in London. We almost doubled its size by extending into next door, matching the old building so it was seamless. I'm involved in putting a restaurant in the library of the Royal Institution where they hold the Christmas science lectures. I've argued that we should have carpets, tablecloths and curtains but, from the managerial side, this means stains on the floor, food smells in the curtains and tablecloths you have to clean. One of the recent revolutions of restaurant taste is the rise of what would be caf 00e9 style. Hard surfaces and sharp acoustics have become upmarket. That would never have been good taste even 10 years ago. 00b7 Delikatesn, 1a York Place, Edinburgh EH1; 0131 556 1133; www.delikatesn.com Rafael Vi 00f1oly was born in Uruguay, educated in Argentina and emigrated to New York in 1978. His projects include 20 Fenchurch Street in London, the Vdara Condo Hotel in Las Vegas, and the City College of New York's School of Architecture. Food is definitely not one of my passions. I don't know any of the fashionable restaurants. I don't need overly complicated experiences. I have a short temper for stupidity and I have an enormous counter-reaction to pomposity. My business is conducted in one place, Mezzogiorno, in the office or wherever the client wants to take me. It's like ballet: I know ballet is a wonderful thing to see but I'm not cultivated enough for it, like I'm not cultivated enough for food. I'm sure I've missed something. Mezzogiorno is three blocks from the office. It is the most unremarkable place but it has this warmth and sense of purpose. It has a good Italian cook, early-Eighties decor, drawings and sculptures from Florence, and an atmosphere created by incredible, sympathetic owners. They know what I eat and suggest things. I'm not fussy. We have an extremely good young Brazilian cook at home in downtown New York. My wife, Diana, helped her through one of the best cooking schools in New York. When we travel we take food on the plane prepared by her. She surprises us every night. You don't need to choose; you just sit down and there is something prepared. It's very Japanese in a way. There are some restaurants in Japan I've been lucky enough to go to that are not even advertised - just a kitchen and six chairs. And you get no choice: you eat whatever the guy gives you. It is a completely different every time and costs more than the Hotel Bel-Air. I'm doing a huge hotel in Las Vegas, with 14 restaurants. It is interesting that people in this industry, with an eye on the consumer, build with the idea that in six months' time they will change again. I don't think that is a good thing - why change if it's working? But they change it simply to regenerate the image. It's very dangerous territory. In order to achieve excellence, things ought not to be on a seasonal cycle. You couldn't write Shakespeare on that basis. 00b7 Mezzogiorno, 195 Spring Street, New York, NY 10012; (212) 334 2112; www.mezzogiorno.com Thomas Heatherwick is a designer, self-taught architect, artist and all-round visionary whose eclectic body of work includes the Rolling Bridge in London's Paddington Basin, the UK's tallest public sculpture, Manchester's 'B of the Bang', and the dramatic East Beach Cafe in Littlehampton. I'm interested in things being particular to their location. For something to be sustainable, it has to be specific to its location, because the idea is to have a building that will never need to be recycled. The East Beach Cafe isn't a council project, and there's no additional funding. It's essentially funded by a Mr Whippy machine and we had an enormous responsibility to make that achievable. I met the owner Jane Wood at a party. She told me about her dream of having a beach caf 00e9 and was very open to what it might be. We both agreed we didn't want anything that would hook on to sea cliches like sails or yachts. The site is closer to the sea than the buildings around it, so it didn't need to be caught in the tyranny of being 'in-keeping', so no polite reworking of Regency buildings. We asked ourselves: what is the character of the sea? We decided it's all the bits and bobs you find among the rocks and pebbles on the beach. The building didn't need to be pretty, but to be tough to cope with kids, sand and seagulls' poo. There were practical constraints, like the site has a long promenade that we couldn't build on, and a high-pressure sewage line at the back, which meant it had to be long and thin. We didn't want windows at the back because it was a car park and so we played on the feel of being in a cave. We put diagonals going through to give it a stepped profile. Our work is mainly buildings now and it's progressed from Konstam [a restaurant in London's King's Cross] last year, which was just the interior, to this, a whole building. We're now working on a restaurant in Hong Kong. A restaurant is only as good as its food and its service. The design is third on the list. I admire chefs. They have to be brilliant all the time. That is terrifying for me because I am a slow thinker. As a designer of buildings you need time to immerse yourself. A chef has to produce his best work every day. I get my best ideas through discussion. I'm trying to make a way we can all ricochet thoughts off each other; in the new studio there is a long, open kitchen and dining area. Meetings will take place virtually in the kitchen. The main reason is to have as many different groups bumping into each other as possible. In the studio there is a big group of architects but also people with diverse backgrounds like theatre design. I've been interested in designing buildings since I was tiny. Buildings are fascinating because they need so many different forms of expertise. 00b7 East Beach Cafe, Littlehampton, West Sussex; 01903 731903; www.eastbeachcafe.co.uk  ",

The issue seems on the cusp of being litigated in Maine, where symptomless nurse Kaci Hickox, who recently returned from treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, has been jockeying with the governor of Maine and, before that, New Jersey, over these issues. Related issues have been raised in a lawsuit filed on behalf of Ikeoluwa Opayemi, a Milford, Conn. third-grader, who was ordered to stay home from school this month after having accompanied her parents to Nigeria for a wedding.

Ferguson decision of 1896, where he refused to endorse the majority 2019s 201cseparate but equal 201d doctrine, which blessed apartheid policies in the American South). Jacobson was decided in the wake of a smallpox outbreak in Boston that comprised 1,596 cases and led to 270 deaths, according to a 2005 analysis of the case in the American Journal of Public Health by Lawrence O. Gostin, an authority on law and public health issues at Georgetown University Law Center. Jacobson was actually a vaccine case. The 7-2 majority upheld Massachusetts 2019 right to sanction Jacobson for refusing to undergo the smallpox vaccine. Under the state 2019s general 201cpolice 201d powers, the Court held, the State may invest local officials or commissions with 201cauthority in some appropriate way to safeguard the public health and the public safety. 201d While health-related edicts sometimes restrict individual liberties 2014as vaccine and quarantine laws unquestionably do 2014and therefore implicate federal Due Process concerns, 201cthe liberty secured by the Constitution of the United States 2026 does not import an absolute right in each person to be, at all times and in all circumstances, wholly freed from restraint, 201d Justice Harlan wrote. 201cUpon the principle of self-defense, of paramount necessity, a community has the right to protect itself against an epidemic of disease which threatens the safety of its members. 201d As an example, he continued: 201cAn American citizen, arriving at an American port on a vessel in which, during the voyage, there had been cases of yellow fever or Asiatic cholera, although apparently free from disease himself, may yet, in some circumstances, be held in quarantine against his will on board of such vessel or in a quarantine station, until it be ascertained 2026 that the danger of the spread of the disease among the community at large has disappeared. 201d But while those portions of the decision seem to grant broad discretion to health authorities, other passages impose clear restrictions on their powers even in this context, potentially favoring the legal positions of people like Hickox or Opayemi. 201cIt might be, 201d Justice Harlan cautioned, for instance, 201cthat an acknowledged power of a local community to protect itself against an epidemic threatening the safety of all, might be exercised in particular circumstances and in reference to particular persons in such an arbitrary, unreasonable manner, or might go so far beyond what was reasonably required for the safety of the public, as to authorize or compel the courts to interfere for the protection of such persons. 201d Professor Gostin, in his 2005 article, distilled from that ruling four standards that he believes must be met by health regulations if they are avoid impinging fundamental, federally protected individual liberties: Against this framework, the devil is then in the details. In the case of Hickox, for instance, it appeared at first as if governors Mario Cuomo of New York and Chris Christie of New Jersey, who called a joint press conference to announce their tough new stance, had made a fundamentally political decision to start systematically quarantining any health care worker who had worked with Ebola patients, even if symptomless. 201cWhen political figures start grandstanding, 201d says Charles Sims in an interview, 201cand haven 2019t even consulted health commissioners, courts will be very reluctant to uphold deprivations of liberty. 201d A litigation partner at the Proskauer law firm in New York, Sims spent nine years as staff counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union in an earlier life. On the other hand, it appears that there was evidence that Hickox initially showed at least a slight fever when she was individually screened at Newark Airport, which might have justified preliminary quarantining. The question then becomes whether her accommodations in the plastic tent provided for her there were adequate and appropriate. After she tested negative for the disease and was allowed to return to her home in Maine, the question shifts to whether the conditions of her home confinement there are scientifically necessary and reasonable. Can the state stop her from biking in the country? Can it stop her from going to a crowded movie theater? If she visits New York, could Governor Cuomo stop her from coming to Grand Central? In an email, I asked Gostin if state and city officials might also lawfully take into account the public 2019s irrational fears about the disease 2014because it appears to me that that 2019s the crux of what politicians are being tempted to do. In New York, for instance, could a politician take into account the fact that someone who comes down with Ebola shortly after having used a subway 2014though he was still asymptomatic at the time of the ride 2014might cause thousands of people to fear using the subway, even if scientists say the subway remains perfectly safe? Gostin 2019s answer was refreshingly unamibiguous. 201cThe answer is no, 201d he wrote. 201cGovernment cannot use public fear as a rationale for depriving a person of liberty. Indeed the rule of law stands precisely to prevent that kind of injustice. The only basis for lawful quarantine is significant risk based on science. 201d  ",

   "input": "Updated NOV 14, 2014 2:32a ET CALGARY, Alberta -- Paul Byron finally scored a goal for the first time since opening night, and then he added another. Byron scored twice to break out of a 16-game scoring funk, and the Calgary Flames beat the Arizona Coyotes 5-3 on Thursday night. Playing in career game No. 99, Byron had his first two-goal game in the NHL. It felt good. It was a lot of work coming , a lot of time shooting pucks in practice with the coaching staff and stuff like that, Byron said. The chances have been coming and I've been extremely happy with that. It was just a matter of time , I thought, before they started going in. Since beating Ryan Miller for Calgary's first goal of the season back on Oct. 8 , Byron has had at least a half-dozen breakaways that he has failed to convert. We just don't want him to get any more breakaways , teammate Mark Giordano said with a chuckle. He gets breakaways , he doesn't bury them. But 2-on-1s, 3-on-2s, he's money. We'll just let him pull up or something next time he gets a break. David Jones , Giordano and Sean Monahan also scored for Calgary (10-6-2), while Sven Baertschi added two assists, his first points of the season. The Flames, who have won five of their last seven, began a five-game homestand that will continue Saturday night against the Ottawa Senators. Shane Doan, Antoine Vermette and Joe Vitale scored for Arizona (6-9-1), which has lost three straight. The Coyotes will continue their three-game road swing through western Canada with a game Friday night in Vancouver. Way too many opportunities for them and gave up too many chances and we have to be better , Doan said. We had opportunities to win the game but we made dumb mental mistakes. Byron gave the Flames a 1-0 lead 11:06 into the first period , then scored early in the second to stake Calgary to a 2-1 lead. It certainly changes your confidence going forward in the game , he said. It gets a little mojo in your game and it feels like the rest of the game , pucks seem to follow your stick a little bit. Hopefully, I can keep that going. Trailing 3-1 , Arizona stormed back to tie it on goals by Vermette and Vitale, whose wrist shot from the corner slid inside the goalpost on Jonas Hiller. The Flames took the lead for a third time at 16:23 of the second period on Giordano's sixth goal. The Calgary captain was set up neatly by TJ Brodie, who faked a shot at the point, moved in and, after freezing goaltender Mike Smith, slid the puck down low to Giordano, who one-timed it just under the crossbar to make it 4-3. Nursing that one-goal lead, Calgary got some insurance at 12:23 of the third when Jones shot the puck toward the front of the net and it banked in off of the leg of Connor Murphy. It was the third goal of the season and third in as many games for Jones. Starting for the seventh time in eight games, Hiller finished with 20 saves to improve to 8-4-1. Smith, who has gotten off to a shaky start this season, had 20 saves and saw his record fall to 4-9-0. Notes: Calgary improves to 5-0-1 in games after a regulation loss. ... Not dressed for Arizona was C Brandon McMillan, who sat out his first game of the year, D Chris Summers and D Brandon Gormley. ... Healthy scratches for Calgary were LW Brandon Bollig and RW Devin Setoguchi. Including last year's playoffs with Chicago, Bollig hasn't scored in his last 50 games and Setoguchi has no points in 10 games this season. Both players were acquired during the summer. ... The Flames improved to 7-1-2 when scoring first. ... It was the first of five meetings between the teams this season.  ",

   "input": "PARK CITY, Utah 2014 Because independent cinema is 2014 in theory, anyway 2014 more open to a diversity of voices than are mainstream movies, female filmmakers, characters, and issues have always been well represented at the Sundance Film Festival. (Leave aside, for a moment, the fact that half of all humanity is the mainstream.) This year 2019s festival, however, seems more focused than usual on what women are doing behind the camera and in front of it. Sundance can be as much of a boys 2019 club as Hollywood, but starting with the opening-night offerings 2014 a documentary about singer Nina Simone (Liz Garbus 2019s 201cWhat Happened, Miss Simone? 201d) and 201cThe Bronze, 201d a raunchy comedy about a has-been gymnast co-written by its star, a dynamo named Melissa Rauch 2014 Sundance 2015 has been celebrating and contemplating what it means to be part of the girls 2019 club. The topic turned explicit during the festival 2019s most in-demand panel discussion, 201c Power of Story: Serious Ladies, 201d in which Mindy Kaling ( 201cThe Mindy Project 201d), Lena Dunham (HBO 2019s 201cGirls 201d), Jenji Kohan (creator of Netflix 2019s 201cOrange Is the New Black 201d), and actress-comedian Kristen Wiig mixed it up on the stage of Main Street 2019s Egyptian Theatre, under prompting from Emily Nussbaum, TV critic for The New Yorker. The free-ranging conversation covered the limits of public persona (Wiig: 201cI go to a dinner and people say, 2018Do a funny voice. 2019 Like I walk around New York in a funny wig punching people in the stomach 201d), personal confidence (Kaling: 201cI have this personality defect where I 2019m unable to see myself as the underdog. My parents raised me with the entitlement of a tall, blonde, white man 201d) to the importance of building an industry network of women creators (Dunham: 201cWe stalk every woman who works in television and force them to have long dinners with us. Actually, that would be nice, if guys complained, 2018It 2019s so hard to break into Hollywood, there 2019s such an old girls 2019 network 2019 201d). Elsewhere, issues faced by women in the larger society were raised in films that demanded responses from audiences. 201cThe Hunting Ground, 201d a documentary by Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering ( 201dThe Secret War, 201d 2012) about the epidemic of campus rape, premiered to a standing-ovation Park City crowd that included US Senators Barbara Boxer and Kirsten Gillibrand. The film amasses stories and statistics to devastating effect, relying on on-camera testimonies from women in dozens of colleges across the country (including many in the Boston area), and building a shameful portrait of administrators and police departments systematically blaming the victim. A CNN Films coproduction, 201cThe Hunting Ground 201d will air on TV after a possible theatrical release; it needs to be seen. Boston-bred writer-producer-actress Mindy Kaling hung out at an Eddie Bauer-sponsored party with writer-director-actor Eli Roth, who 2019s from Newton. There are, of course, plenty of boy movies at Sundance, and good ones too. 201cThe End of the Tour 201d succeeds at the unlikely mission of dramatizing a 1996 road trip involving Rolling Stone journalist David Lipsky (Jesse Eisenberg) and legendary author David Foster Wallace (a surprisingly moving Jason Segel). The unstoppable James Franco has two movies at the festival; the buzz on 201cTrue Story 201d is strong, but 201cI Am Michael, 201d in which the actor plays a gay activist turned anti-gay Christian pastor is muddled and turgid. The Duplass brothers, Jay and Mark, are usually here with projects they 2019ve directed and or are acting in; this year, they 2019re just content to have produced three festival entries, 201cThe Bronze, 201d 201cThe Overnight, 201d and 201cTangerine 201d 2014 and then have topped things off by announcing a four-picture deal with Netflix. But the excited word-of-mouth that always starts circulating by day two or three of the festival has mostly to do with actresses, women directors, and feminist themes, some of them arriving in genre clothing. 201cThe Witch, 201d a horror-suspense film that takes place in 1630 New England among a Puritan family riven by paranoia, has been the buzz of early Sundance, with packed screenings, hourlong wait-lines, and praise for the central performance by Anya Taylor-Joy as the daughter accused of sorcery. (The film sold to the adventurous distributor A24 for $1.5 million on the third day of the festival.) Another hot ticket is 201cThe Diary of a Teenage Girl, 201d based on Phoebe Gloeckner 2019s 2002 graphic novel and featuring a raw, funny, and risk-taking lead performance by British actress Bel Powley as a 15-year-old cartoonist coming of sexual and emotional age in 1976 San Francisco. The film costars Wiig as the heroine 2019s mother (perhaps the actress 2019s most successful serious role to date) and Alexander Skarsgard as her much older lover, but the film 2019s primarily a triumph for first-time writer-director Marielle Heller and for Powley, whose face eerily evokes Gloeckner 2019s wide-eyed drawing style and who portrays youthful female passion and sexuality with a blunt honesty rarely seen onscreen. Rauch has now landed in the indie consciousness with the cheerfully rude farce 201cThe Bronze, 201d in which she plays a onetime Olympic gymnast experiencing the after-burn of fame. (Think of it as 201cTonya Harding: The Later Years. 201d) It 2019s a hit-or-miss affair, with a few indelible moments (a sex scene that would earn a 10 from the Romanian judge, for one) and the lingering sensation that we 2019ll be hearing more, and better, from Rauch in the future. After 201cBachelorette 201d divided Sundance audiences in 2012 with its caustic comedy of gal-pal dysfunction 2014 it was like 201cBridesmaids, 201d only meaner 2014 some were wondering if we 2019d ever hear from writer-director Leslye Headland again. 201cSleeping With Other People 201d brought this ribald talent back to the festival with a vengeance: an acridly charming (and at times very dirty) romantic comedy about a friendship between two serial cheaters (Jason Sudeikis and Alison Brie of 201cCommunity 201d and 201cMad Men 201d), 201cSleeping 201d subverts the cliches of Hollywood rom-coms with edginess and unexpected warmth. In the post-screening Q & A, Headland described the film as 201c 2018When Harry Met Sally. . . 2019 with [jerks], 201d which both encapsulates her sense of humor and the marketing challenge her movie faces. On the other hand, the woman sitting next to me at the screening was crying happy tears at the film 2019s conclusion, a testimony to Headland 2019s successful reinvigoration of a tired genre. She seems to have heeded the words of the women on the Serious Ladies panel when asked what advice they 2019d give to the young women coming up behind them. The answers were unanimous and they apply not just to women: Do it yourself. Keep working. Trust your voice. In the words of Dunham, 201cTell the story you want to tell. We 2019re all so less weird than we think we are. 201d  ",

Only one program won four straight big-school state titles -- Phoenix Union from 1958 to 1961 -- and Monday night Corona gets its chance to join the defunct school in such a long run of excellence. It's made us stronger and made us mentally tough. I am so proud of our guys getting back to the four straight state champions, said Corona coach Sam Duane Jr. , who would be the first coach to win four in a row.

   "input": "Boston Children 2019s Hospital is extending its reach to patients far outside Boston, with a deal to acquire a large and growing group of doctors in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. The nonprofit hospital plans to complete the acquisition of Children 2019s and Women 2019s Physicians of Westchester LLP, a for-profit group of 276 doctors, this summer. Terms were not disclosed. The hospital already treats many patients from other states and countries, but this is its first acquisition outside Massachusetts. The deal will add thousands of patients to the Children 2019s network and advance the hospital 2019s out-of-state expansion strategy; last year Children 2019s earnings rose on increased business from international patients. 201cChildren 2019s wants to be more and more a regional hospital, 201d said Ruselle W. Robinson, a health care lawyer at the Boston firm Posternak Blankstein & Lund LLP. 201cIt already has a national reputation, but now they want to extend their reach for patients. 201d The addition of hundreds of doctors and thousands of patients is not expected to have any direct impact on patients from the Boston area 2014 other than perhaps strengthening the hospital 2019s finances by providing a new source of revenue and more referrals. Children 2019s is the dominant pediatric hospital in Massachusetts and New England. It is one of the highest-cost providers in the state, but known for treating the sickest and smallest of patients. The idea, said Dr. Kevin Churchwell, the chief operating officer at Children 2019s, is to create a pediatric health care network across the Northeast in which doctors coordinate care online and through electronic health records. 201cWhat is coming from health care reform, and what we see as the future of health care, is the continuum of care is going to be profoundly important, 201d Churchwell said. 201cIn order to do that, we have to have alliances, we have to have partnerships, and we have to have practices that we control, that are part of us. 201d Because Children 2019s is acquiring a company based outside of Massachusetts, it was not immediately clear whether the deal would be reviewed by the Health Policy Commission, a state agency that studies health care mergers and acquisitions. A hospital spokesman said a review is not necessary, but a commission spokesman said the commission is requesting more information from Children 2019s before making such a determination. The Westchester practice is spread across 57 locations in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. Dr. Leonard Newman, president of the Valhalla, N.Y.-based doctors group, said that despite its reach across three states, the group needs to be part of a larger system. 201cIn this health care market, to provide the best care for children, we need to have a partner that has stature, 201d Newman said, 201cand Boston Children 2019s Hospital has that reputation here in New York and New Jersey and Connecticut. 201d The group has grown every year since it was formed in 2000, and Newman said it is likely to attract even more doctors after joining the Children 2019s Hospital network. Children 2019s is unlike most acute-care hospitals because its competition is not just local institutions, but also pediatric centers around the world. The hospital 2019s move into New York and New Jersey puts it in the back yard of another premier pediatric hospital, Children 2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. 201cParents are willing to travel when it 2019s their children 2019s health in question, 201d said Robert S. Huckman, a Harvard Business School professor. Executives at Boston Children 2019s and the Westchester group said that the merger will allow for better coordination of care for the many New York- area patients who already see doctors at Children 2019s. The deal also has the potential to improve care for other patients in the tri-state area by giving them better access to pediatric specialists, executives said. The distance between the two health care organizations will not get in the way of coordinating care, they added. 201cIt seems like it 2019s a long way, Boston to New York, 201d Newman said. 201cBut now with the Internet, immediate assistance can go back and forth. Even evaluation of patients can be done online. 201d Children 2019s has about 1,300 physicians. It had more than 551,000 patient visits and discharged more than 24,000 patients from its hospital during the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. It earned $113 million on operations in that year, a 28 percent increase from the previous year. The jump in profits was driven by a surge in patients from outside of Massachusetts, especially from the Middle East, Asia, and Latin America. Robert Mechanic, a health care specialist at Brandeis University, called the acquisition a smart strategic move for Children 2019s. 201cThey have a reputation, 201d he said. 201cThey can draw people from outside the region, and they probably should take advantage of it. 201d  ",

   "input": "New York City distinguished itself from the rest of the country in two important housing categories in the 1980 census - one of them indicating poverty and the other, wealth. Government and private analysts say that taken together, the findings show that the city has some serious housing problems, including a growing gap between housing for the poor and housing for the rich. ''There really are two cities in New York,'' said George Sternlieb, director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University. ''We've always had a city of contrasts, but never have they been so sharp as now, because now there is no middle.'' One category in which the city showed results far different from the rest of the country was in the number of housing units lost to abandonment and demolition; the Bronx and Brooklyn led the nation's counties. The other was the average number of people in each household. Manhattan had 1.96 persons - the lowest figure in the country, except for the 1.46 in a Hawaiian county that is said to contain only a leper colony. In the first category, Bronx County had a net loss of 56,459 houses and apartments, or 11.1 percent of its 1970 total of 508,789 units. Kings County, or Brooklyn, had a net loss of 22,428 units, or 2.5 percent of its 1970 total of 902,622. Only 55 of the 3,098 other counties in the country showed losses, and those losses totaled only 7,200 units. Over the decade, the Bronx's population declined from 1,471,701 to 1,169,115. Brooklyn's declined from 2,602,012 to 2,230,936. Most of the 55 counties outside the city showing a loss of housing units were rural areas in the South and Middle West. Arthur Young, chief of the Census Bureau's housing division, pointed out that it was significant that the statistics were compiled on the county level. One must be careful, he said, when comparing New York with other cities because each of New York's five boroughs is a separate county, whereas most other cities make up only part of a single county. Thus, he noted that despite the losses in the Bronx and Brooklyn, New York City as a whole registered a slight increase in the number of housing units, from 2,924,281 to 2,946,098. Manhattan gained about 40,000 units, Queens,31,0, and Staten Island,30,000. Other Cities Lost Housing Units Moreover, some other large cities actually had net losses of housing. Detroit lost more than 60,000 units, Chicago more than 41,0, St. Louis more than 37,000 and Cleveland more than 24,000. Each of those cities, however, is part of a county that, over all, gained housing units. Large losses of housing units have traditionally been unusual, Mr. Young said, primarily because young people leave their parents to set up their own households and because the Census Bureau counts vacant units that it considers habitable, as well as all occupied units. Those factors have traditionally enabled many places simultaneously to lose population and gain housing units. For example, despite gaining a small number of housing units, the city lost population, declining from 7.89 million to 7.07 million, according to the census. The city has challenged the population total in court, contending that upward of 750,000 New Yorkers were not counted. The losses in the Bronx and Brooklyn, then, reflected the severe economic troubles in those boroughs, according to Mr. Young, local landlords and private demographers. 158,000 Vacant Units in City ''The figures are startling when you consider that it means we've lost that many places where people lived,'' said Ruben Klein, a landlord, who is president of the Bronx Realty Advisory Board. He said the actual losses might be somewhat higher because the Census Bureau might have counted as habitable some vacant apartments that were, in fact, permanently abandoned. The number of vacant units in the city counted in the census was 158,000. In 1970, the number was 80,000. Frank Kristof, a former census official and now president of the Rent Stabilization Association, a New York landlord group, said most of the vacancies were in badly deteriorated neighborhoods. He said it was probably true that many of those units should not have been counted as available housing, and, thus, dropped from the total. Had that happened, the city would have had a net loss in housing. In the second category in which the city distinguished itself, the average number of people in each household, all the other counties in the country had at least two persons per household except for Kalawao, Hawaii. Peter K. Francese, the publisher of American Demographics magazine, said that that county contained only 144 persons, all of them in the leper colony. Leper Colony Count Questioned ''There's some question about whether the census enumerators actually went there to count the people,'' Mr. Francese said. He added that, for all practical purposes, Kalawao was not really a county, and that therefore Manhattan had the lowest person-perhousehold figure of any county in the nation. Mr. Francese said the 1.96 figure -down from 2.2 in 1970 - meant that ''it is likely that over half'' of the 704,000 occupied units in Manhattan had only one person living in them. Officials generally consider it a sign of economic well-being when a household contains only one or two people. That is especially true in Manhattan, they say, where housing costs are extremely high. The Census Bureau has not yet compiled statistics on the question of how much people pay for housing. The national average is 2.8 persons per household. Nationally, only 23 percent of the households have one person in them. Mr. Sternlieb of the Rutgers research center said the movement toward fewer people per household in Manhattan, coupled with the rising abandonment rate in many parts of the city, did not bode well for the city's future. He said it meant that the only market for new housing was in the areas that could command the highest prices - Manhattan - where the wealthiest people live, most of whom do not have children. At the same time, he said, housing was being lost in areas that the city needed to save if it wanted to keep middle-income families. He said the gap between housing for the rich and housing for the poor had grown in recent years and would continue to grow unless something could be done to stimulate new housing for the middle and lower classes. ''We lose housing from the bottom and replace it at the top, '' he said. ''Nobody is building any of the kind that's being lost.''  ",

   "input": "WASHINGTON, Feb. 17 2014 Republican Party leaders have begun a series of daylong strategy sessions to develop a plan for becoming the nation's majority party within the next 10 years. Richard Richards, the Republican national chairman, said that the purpose of the sessions was to anticipate changes in party roles and in the makeup of the electorate so that recent Republican gains could be maintained. One participant in a session last week, Mitch Daniels of Indiana, said: ''It was a very un-Republican meeting. We kept talking about the future and new ideas.'' Mr. Richards, the Utah Republican who took over as national chairman last month, said that the five sessions would bring in state and county chairmen, Congressmen, poll-takers, producers of television commercials and other party activists. ''We're talking about how we achieve our majority status in the next 10,'' he said. Weakening of Parties One key element in the discussions has been an attempt to gauge just what the role of political parties will be in the next decade. Mr. Richards remarked that single-issue politics and independent political expenditures were working against strong parties. One topic on the agenda for all the sessions is ''What must happen during the 1980's in order for the trend away from parties to be reversed.'' Yesterday that issue was a major part of the discussions at a meeting involving Republican county chairman. Joseph M. Margiotta, the Nassau County Republican leader, said, ''We agreed we have to start making the party more important and getting away from the candidate being the whole thing.'' One device urged at yesterday's meeting, he said, was a system of regular meetings that would bring county chairmen and state chairmen together. Mr. Richards said that the focus of the meetings, which are to conclude Feb. 24 in Los Angeles, was not only to build upon the successes of the 1980 elections but also upon a trend of increasing Republican Party allegiance that was found in data compiled by Richard Wirthlin, President Reagan's poll-taker. Mr. Withlin confirmed today that his most recent data had found Republican gains among young voters and a significant narrowing of the gap between Republican and Democratic allegiances in the public. Findings of Survey The most recent New York Times CBS News Poll indicates that 37 percent of voting-age Americans identify themselves as Democrats and 26 percent as Republicans. Among individuals from 18 to 29 years old, the Democrats' lead was only 33 percent to 26 percent. A year ago, the margin in that age group was 36 percent to 18 percent. Sharon Sharp, co-chairman of the Republican Party in Cook County, Ill., said that the meeting yesterday also focused on ways for the party to ''widen its base'' and to attract more young voters and members of ethnic groups and trade unions. ''We looked at issues that perhaps we should get more involved in, such as crime,'' she said, discussing how the party hoped to attract such groups.  ",

   "input": "IN the last decade, torrential rains have swollen and flooded its streams on three occasions required Westchester County to be declared a Federal disaster area. Flood damage following a June 1972 storm amounted to more than $20 million and flood stages were two feet higher in September 1975, when Yonkers, in one example, experienced what was called the most damaging flood in its history. The Army Corps of Engineers has studied dozens of rivers and streams in the county since the mid-1950's and made 31 reports on flood-control investigations. Now it has concluded its research with a draft report on the Grassy Sprain Brook and the Bronx River. The draft report recommends that no Federal action is warranted for the area. The decision, based on cost effectiveness, affects the lower stretches of those rivers where they meet in East Yonkers and Bronxville, south of Tuckahoe. A public hearing on the draft report will be held at the Westchester County Center in White Plains on Tuesday at 8 P.M. Basements in apartment buildings along the Sprain Brook Parkway were flooded, and water inundated commercial buildings on Paxton Avenue in Bronxville in 1972, 1975 and during the third major flood in the summer of 1971. The Bronx River Parkway is often closed at Paxton Avenue and Pondfield Road in Bronxville when the Bronx River overflows its banks. Motorists trapped by rapidly rising waters have had to have been rescued from the roofs of their submerged cars. Seven alternative plans were put forward by the engineers, involving estimated Federal costs ranging from $2.9 million to nearly $5.5 million. All were discarded. The corps' decision means, in effect, that no Federal money will be forthcoming for structural or nonstructural solutions to future flooding. But until the public hearing, at which Col. Walter M. Smith Jr., district engineer for New York, will preside, the issue is not yet formally sealed. Reaction from Tuckahoe and Bronxville ranged from disappointment to resignation. Mayor Philip A. White of Tuckahoe said, ''We're disappointed that no Federal funds will be coming in for a job that really needs to be done. But we'll be at the hearing.'' He noted that plans to replace rusted sluice gates in several Bronx River dams would be a comparatively inexpensive way to reduce the impact of floods. William J. Murphy, a Bronxville village trustee who has followed the corps studies for more than a year, said the corps ''prices itself out of doing the job.'' When it builds a levee or floodwall, Mr. Murphy said, the safety factor, or ''freeboard,'' is ''so super, super, it's out of proportion to the cost.'' ''Their level of safety is beyond what NASA would need,'' he said. Guiding corps recommendations for action is a formula it calls a benefit cost ratio. If the ratio falls below one, as it did for all seven improvement plans in the area, the corps concludes that its recommendations would cost more than the project would be worth. Estimated annual costs for a project are divided into a figure estimated to be the cost of flood damage to an area if the improvements were not made, according to Stephen Fine, chief of the New York Planning Group of the corps. A mix of solutions involving floodwalls, levees and channel modifications was considered by the corps engineers and rejected. They also studied various combinations of ''nonstructural'' suggestions that included raising residences so that the first floors were above what they call ''the expected 100-year flood level'' and allowing the basements to flood. The ''100-year level,'' a standard used repeatedly in the draft report, refers to a flood condition so serious that the corps can envision it happening only once a century. Four of the seven plans involved Bronxville and East Yonkers. Two of the remaining three affected Tuckahoe, and the seventh laid plans for modifying the ''slope and cross-sectional area'' of both streams. All plans were predicated on the assumption by local authorities of various costs of easements, rights of way and maintenance incurred by Federal improvements. Those costs ranged from $225,000 in connection with some nonstructural changes in Tuckahoe to $2.8 million for the channel modifications that would have been borne by all three communities. Floodwalls and levees up to 12 feet above existing ground elevation were planned for the east banks of both rivers between Kimball Avenue and the Bronx River Parkway along the Sprain Brook Parkway and from Palmer Road south to the bridge carrying Conrail tracks across the Bronx River. Temporary movable ''closures'' to protect houses and apartment buildings such as the Brooklands and Winchester complexes along the Grassy Sprain Brook were studied. While the corps found such closures feasible for the Winchester apartments, they were not recommended for Brooklands, primarily because they ''would have to be installed to a height that would prevent natural light and ventilation from entering the 35 garden apartments.'' In Tuckahoe, the corps studied the idea of capping existing flume walls with a three- to four-foot extension on both sides of the Bronx River where it passes a pharmaceutical plant. It also looked at the possibility of raising 26 residential units ''in the vicinity of Yonkers Avenue, Armorvilla Avenue and Garrett Street a foot and a half higher and protecting other structures in the immediate area with temporary closures.'' Although it said Federal measures ''are not warranted at this time,'' the corps added that ''local officials and affected publics should carefully recognize the flood-damage potential in their communities and take appropriate action to prevent increase of flood-damage potential.'' Mr. Murphy, the Bronxville trustee, said his village was investigating the possibility that Westchester County might help it finance a berm, or earthen wall, along the Bronx River Parkway that would cost ''less than $300, 000.''

   "input": "IF you were told that there is a custom among us that is suspect in its origins, inequitable in its application and unsound in its philosophy - and yet, for all that, acquiesced in with hardly a murmur -could you name it? Could your mind sift through the haystack of practices that only pretend to such distinction (the cocktail hour? the income tax? the expense account lunch? the Presidential primary?) and find the needle I have in mind? Could you, in other words, come up with the villain of this piece, the usage that for half the year tyrannizes us like a king with no clothes on? Of course you could. It is daylight-saving time. And since we once again must bow to its yoke this weekend, what better occasion to challenge its claims? First, as to its suspect origins. Like all usurpers it hides its lack of natural right to rule under a myth of divine birth. Ask any schoolchild. Daylight time, you will be assured, sprang fully formed like Venus from the brow of Benjamin Franklin. Pure buncombe, of course, but a triumph of fiction over fact nevertheless. Franklin did indeed advance the idea, but in a piece of whimsy written 132 years before the country grew humorless enough to take him seriously. Historically its true origin is demonic, not divine. Its adoption was first advocated by entrepreneurs who realized that if you could con people into thinking the sun was shining an hour longer, you might very well get another 60 minutes' worth of haymaking out of them. And it was actually instituted in wartime - to increase the production of things designed to stop people from making hay altogether (for the record the dates are Germany 1915, England 1916, the United States 1917). My personal disenchantment derives from the second of my charges - namely, that in practice daylight time results in inequities. For one thing, the daylight it purports to save is all in the evening. For another, the dates at which it undertakes to begin and end this selective rescue (late April and October) serve only to skew things even more. And for the last, rather than making the summer more bearable, it obtrudes the sun's heat on the very part of the day that needs it least. Let me illustrate these points in order. Suppose for a moment that I am, as is the case, a confirmed morning person. And suppose further, as is not the case, that I actually subscribe to the notion that daylight can be saved by resetting clocks. Does that mean I must accept the present system quietly? It does not. For me it immediately raises the question why the savings are not deposited at the beginning of the day rather than at the end. Why not to the larks' account rather than the owls'? I am aware, of course, that owls run the world and don't care whose ox is gored as long as it's not theirs. I am also aware that their principal argument for saving daylight in the evening is that if we didn't, the sun in solstice would rise at the, to them, monstrous hour of 4:15. Accordingly, since the best defense against such people is to be as offensive as they are, I propose a new system. Set the clocks back instead of forward in the spring and frighten them with an even bigger hobgoblin: sunrise at 3:15. Note the excellences of this proposal. First, it is quite natural. Somewhere north of here the summer sun already rises at that time (indeed, to the north of there it never even sets). What is truly monstrous is not the dawn's early light but the darkness of minds that presume to judge the whole of nature by what happens only south of Armonk. More to the point, though, a morning daylight-saving system would actually improve summer evenings. Consider for a moment what we call the ''heat of the day'' - the hours, four in all, bracketing the sun's transit of the meridian. In reality, of course, no amount of clock changing can make a degree's difference in their oppressiveness; the best we can hope for is to put supper as far away from them as possible. But what does the present system do? It drags the heat out till 3 P.M. so that no one wants even to look at food till 8. And what does that in turn do? It leads us to ply ourselves with cucumbers and gin in an effort to kill time - only to end up killing appetites and brain cells instead. No. Far better to set the clocks back. That way the heat is off at 1 P.M. and we can dine at 6, hungry, cool and sober all at once. It is not only summer evenings that would benefit. If my proposal was left in force all year (the French, for example, already do as much with the present system), winter mornings would be better too. I am not only a lark but a runner. Put them both together and you have a creature who is on the road at 6 A.M. so he can be showered, clothed and in his right mind to begin the day at 8. What, though, do I now find forced upon me instead? Miserable mornings, that's what. In winter the early jogger's greatest need is for light and heat. Accordingly, since both are functions of how long the sun has been up, it's obvious that any sensible system of resetting the clocks should be designed to have it rise as early as possible. But is that the case now? It certainly is not. In winter solstice the sun rises at 7:20 or so, standard time. To keep to my 6 @o'clock starting hour, therefore, I would have to run two miles in pitch darkness and the whole distance in bitter cold: break a leg, freeze to death or both. Putting the sunrise back to 6:20 would get me out in twilight and back in sunlight - and with rather better odds on my survival. On the other hand, if for some reason I could not have morning daylight-saving time all year, I would at least put the changing of the clocks at the equinoxes and not, as we do now, a month later. Consider once again. At the end of April, sunrise comes at about the same time it does in mid-August; at the end of October it occurs when it does in February. To a morning person that is not just asymmetry; it is cruel and unusual punishment, especially in the weeks before the autumn change. The October sun rises so late it might as well be Christmas. Seeing December once is quite sufficient. Who needs a preview? But enough. Mindless systems invite mindless implementation. Since my morning daylight-saving time would probably fare no better, I take it back and withdraw to higher ground. I had a satori, or illumination, recently. While struggling to recall the unmemorable mnemonic (spring ahead, fall back? spring back, fall forward?), it suddenly dawned on me that whichever it was, its meaning was the reverse of what it seemed. The maxim was not a piece of advice about which way to turn the clocks; rather it was a warning against any turning of them at all. Like ''spare the rod, spoil the child,'' it was a double imperative stating a condition that implied a negative. ''If you set the clocks ahead in the spring,'' it said in effect, ''you will just have to put them back in the fall, so'' - and this is its real point - ''don't get all solemn about what's only a game with clocks.'' I like that. We take clocks too seriously as it is; who needs to credit them with the power to create or destroy even an hour? Only we have that. The crucial periods of our lives - the high times, the due seasons, the decisive conjunctions in which time is really gained or lost, redeemed or killed -are creatures of no clock. They come to us not because metal hands impose them but because we ourselves seize them - because finally, instead of waiting to be told what time it is, we dare to decide what it's time for. I like that even more. Who knows? Maybe this weekend I'll even leave one clock unchanged just so I don't forget.  ",

   "input": "WASHINGTON, March 21 2014 President Reagan's five-year plan to expand the nation's armed forces has come under increasing attack not only from those who consider it too costly but also from critics who say the Administration has failed to justify the military need for its large budget. The criticism has come from Democrats and Republicans in Congress and from specialists in military matters outside the Government who span the political spectrum. Their arguments have complicated the Administration's attempts to justify sharp rises in military spending when the Federal Government is facing a $91.5 billion deficit for the fiscal year 1983. The prevailing view in Congress is that the 1983 military budget, proposed at $216 billion, will almost certainly be cut, with the only questions being what will be reduced and by how much. The Administration, however, is not without influential allies. Senator John Tower, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the Armed Services Committee, has warned of the dangers from Soviet military power as he has argued vigorously for the proposed military spending increases. He told the Senate Budget Committee last week that ''no Senator can separate himself from the foreign policy consequences of defense budget reductions.'' Similarly, Representative Jack F. Kemp, Republican of upstate New York, has solidly backed the Administration's military program.Most of the critics do not dispute the Administration's argument that the United States is endangered by the expansion of Soviet military power. But they say the Administration has not identified the particular national interests that are jeopardized, devised a strategy to protect those interests or specified the forces and weapons needed to meet the threat. The Administration, they contend, has thus not made the connection between the Soviet threat and the need for additional military spending. Critic Sees No Global Strategy Representative James R. Jones, Democrat of Oklahoma, who is chairman of the Budget Committee, has contended that the Administration has not related plans for military forces to worldwide commitments. A leading conservative commentator, Walter Laqueur of the Center for Strategic and International Studies here, recently reviewed the Administration's first year and said that ''a strategy is not yet in sight, only occasional comments, gestures and reactions - sometimes conflicting, often inconsistent.'' Another military expert, Edward Luttwak, of the same research center, said that naval strategy consisted only of a list of ships to be built: ''None of this can tell us what we urgently need to know: How can the United States recover geunine naval supremacy, which is one of the premises of our entire world policy?'' A liberal Democrat, Representative Stephen J. Solarz of Brooklyn, said recently that the Administration had not justified spending large sums to refurbish the B-52 bomber fleet, build B-1 bombers and develop Stealth bombers. Those comments appear to reflect a changed mood in Congress and across the nation. The New York Times CBS News Poll published last week shows that a plurality of Americans would like to see the military budget reduced. A year ago, Congress applauded President Reagan's proposed increases in military spending. Today, many members of Congress argue that cuts in proposed military budgets are imperative, saying that the Administration has made neither an economic nor a strategic case for more weapons and troops. Weinberger in Rear-Guard Action Confronted with those arguments, Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger has been fighting a rear-guard action in contrast to the enthusiastic campaign to ''re-arm America'' begun a year ago. Mr. Weinberger has said that Soviet military power is expanding and warned, ''Anyone who believes the defense budget should be based on anything but the size and imminence of the threat we are all facing is pushing fallacious thought to the point of danger.'' He has said that the military budget must be a function of the threat and the need, not of the economy. So far, he has concentrated on general rather than specific arguments, maintaining that ''there is no cheap way to regain defensive strength, especially when you have to do it in a hurry and don't know how much time you have.'' While few disagree with Mr. Weinberger on the Soviet threat, many contend that the Administration's policy for meeting that threat is either too vague or is too ambitious and will unnecessarily tax economic resources. The President proposed a year ago that the nation spend $1,600 billion over the next five years to overcome what Administration officials have called ''years of neglect.'' The goal of that program is for the United States to catch up, militarily, with the Soviet Union. More important, the Administration's program was founded on a new strategy in which American military power would reach around the globe. The United States would be prepared to fight a protracted conventional war and might strike an adversary not where he attacked first but where it would be to this nation's advantage. The armed forces, moreover, were to prepare to meet levels of aggression from nuclear war through conventional conflict to terrorism.  ",

What co-creators Harvey Fierstein (book) and Cyndi Lauper (music and lyrics) have crafted instead is a big-hearted, effervescent exercise in feel-good affirmation. Fierstein and Lauper evidently believe that (to paraphrase a certain pop song of yore) audiences just want to have fun 2014 and on that score, it has to be said, 201cKinky Boots 2019 2019 delivers. The production doesn 2019t really hit its stride, though, until midway through Act 1, when Lola leads a rip-roaring rendition of 201cSex Is in the Heel. 2019 2019 As 201cKinky Boots 2019 2019 moves forward, the lack of a truly hissable villain or a real nail-biter of a crisis robs it of the necessary friction that comes with genuine dramatic tension; conflicts are too quickly ironed out, and the next uplifting message is never long in coming. Boston Opera House, through Aug. 30, 800-982-2787. www.broadwayinboston.com Directed and choreographed by Jerry Mitchell, the production at the Opera House is a touring version of the original, which is still running on Broadway, where it won a bunch of Tony Awards in 2013, including best musical, best original score (making Lauper the first woman to win solo in that category), and best lead actor in a musical for Billy Porter 2019s bravura portrayal of Lola. Kyle Taylor Parker ably fills Porter 2019s stiletto heels in the touring production, endowing Lola with the necessary swagger and charisma, leavened with vulnerability, particularly in Parker 2019s powerful, showstopping performance of 201cHold Me In Your Heart, 2019 2019 sung to Lola 2019s elderly and ailing father. From a bland start Steven Booth steadily comes into his own as Charlie Price, who forges an unlikely alliance and friendship with Lola after Charlie 2019s father dies and leaves him the family shoe company, Price & Son. Faced with a shrinking customer base, Price & Son is struggling, jeopardizing the jobs of workers who have spent their lives there. (Contrary to the usual streamlined, aerodynamic body types on display in a glossy musical like this, the ensemble of 201cKinky Boots 2019 2019 could actually pass for factory workers.) After a chance encounter with Lola, Charlie realizes there 2019s an untapped niche market: men in need of high-heeled women 2019s boots. So he takes a big gamble, retooling Price & Son to focus on the production of the exotic footwear, and enlists Lola (birth name: Simon) to design the boots. One burly worker, played by Joe Coots, makes no secret of the fact that he isn 2019t happy about this, or about Lola 2019s presence in the factory, but he seldom seems to pose any real threat, and his antagonism is short-lived. Charlie 2019s high-toned fiancee (Grace Stockdale) is pressuring him to convert the factory to condos and move to London with her, forcing him to make a choice between her and his loyalty to the workers, many of whom Charlie grew up with. But where 201cKinky Boots 2019 2019 strains for depth is in its depiction of the father issues Lola and Charlie have in common, their mutual struggle with the expectations their dads had for them leading to a bond communicated in a duet, 201cNot My Father 2019s Son. 2019 2019 That bond is ruptured, however, in the days before an all-important presentation of the boots in Milan. The show 2019s be-true-to-who-you-are themes carry distinct echoes of another musical about drag performers, 1983 2019s 201cLa Cage Aux Folles, 2019 2019 for which Fierstein also wrote the book. Lauper 2019s score for 201cKinky Boots 2019 2019 is no match for Jerry Herman 2019s indelible work on 201cLa Cage, 2019 2019 but she has composed some appealing and occasionally infectious numbers. One of them is a minor comic gem titled 201cThe History of Wrong Guys, 2019 2019 an anthem of hope over experience that is winningly performed by Lindsay Nicole Chambers as Lauren, a factory worker whose crush on Charlie is eventually reciprocated. 201cKinky Boots 2019 2019 would be better if it were more ambitious, less eager to please, and less wedded to platitudes like 201cYou change the world when you change your mind. 2019 2019 But I have to admit it 2019s a hard show to resist, and by the uproarious and high-spirited finale, 201cRaise You Up Just Be, 2019 2019 resistance becomes not just futile but pointless.

   "input": "Aug 4 (Reuters) - Forget Milwaukee and Brooklyn - Lagos and Dar es Salaam are the new brewery hot spots, according to U.S. mutual fund managers as they tap Africa's emerging beer companies in pursuit of long-term returns on investment. U.S. fund managers who originally entered the African market by investing in infrastructure said the continent's youthful demographics - large swaths of the continent are at prime beer-drinking age - and favorable economics brought by local production are a recipe for a profitable outlook. It would cost four or five times more for Tanzanians to import beer than to make it domestically , said Babatunde Ojo , portfolio manager for Harding Loevner's $600 million Frontier Emerging Markets strategy. His fund has added in recent months 730,000 shares of Tanzania Breweries Limited and 900,000 shares of East African Breweries, also a Tanzanian company, according to Lipper data. The Templeton Frontier Markets Fund noted that it added $3.58 million to East African Breweries and $11.80 million to Nigerian Breweries. Roughly 45 percent of Tanzanians are between the ages of 15 and 45, prime ages for drinking beer, said Ojo. Those demographics are reflected elsewhere in the continent. Cities including Dar-es-Salaam and Lagos, hubs for young professionals, are expected to experience rapid growth of their young populations, according to a 2015 trends report by Ernst and Young. Africa is expected to see the largest increase in the legal drinking age population by 2018, while in western Europe and North America, the cumulative decline in beer volumes since 1998 has been between 5 percent and 10 percent, according to Rabobank Research. Mark Mobius, executive chairman of the Templeton Emerging Markets Group, is particularly enthusiastic about Nigerian Breweries Plc, which is majority owned by Heineken Holding NV. Templeton Asset Management Ltd. holds 0.83 percent of the company. Relative to its competitors , the company (Nigerian Breweries) imports considerably fewer raw materials - reducing its exposure to the depreciating naira, and lessening the impact on profit margins and turnover - and also has the strongest distribution capability among its peers, Mobius wrote in an email to Reuters last week. To be sure , share prices in Nigerian Breweries and other African peers have been falling this year as some countries suffer from decreased revenue and other commodities and in part because of uncertainty among minority investors about how and whether large global liquor companies Heineken and Diageo PLC will take their interests in Africa. Should they choose to deemphasize beer at the expense of spirits, that could hurt the brewers. Furthermore, some of these stocks are thinly traded and investing in Africa is still considered risky by many. If you invest in Africa , it will be a rocky ride between the possibility of economic and political instability, but if you look at the long-term potential, the rewards you can reap are very interesting and worthwhile, said Francois Sonneville , Director in Food and Agribusiness Research at Rabobank International, a Dutch banking company. Sonneville also said governments could impose tough taxes on beer companies if economic growth remains low this year. Furthermore, not all of Africa may be equally ripe for beer sales. North African countries with large Muslim populations have some of the highest abstention rates in the world, according to the World Health Organization's 2014 global status report on alcohol and health.

I think that at the end of the day the 2022 World Cup will not take place in Qatar , Mr Zwanziger said in an interview with Sport Bild Plus. The former head of the German football federation (DFB) cited high summer temperatures as the reason Qatar would lose the right to host football's global showpiece. As Mr Zwanziger himself says , it's his personal opinion, a FIFA spokesman responded to AFP subsidiary SID when asked about the German's statement. Mr Zwanziger said: Doctors say , and I had insisted on this point in the protocol, that they cannot guarantee that a World Cup can be held in summer in these conditions.

   "input": "Arts organisations in England face being inspected every three years by a small team of experts who will scrutinise everything from how good their work is to how well they manage their finances. The plans amount to a sea change in how publicly funded arts groups - from local theatres and galleries up to the Royal Opera House - are evaluated. Arts Council England is about to consult on what it believes could be a new model for judging success or failure in the public sector. The new inspection regime is being brought in following a report by Sir Brian McMaster into excellence in the arts, in which he called for both greater self-assessment and less box-ticking. The problems of the present method of assessing arts companies were exposed last year when the Arts Council cut funding for nearly 200 organisations: many complained that they had not been given enough warning and decisions were made by faceless bureaucrats. Arts Council England's new chief executive , Alan Davey, told the Guardian that the new system would be based on both self-assessment and peer review, but he said it would avoid the mistakes of other public service models, such as Ofsted, which has spawned a sprawling industry of consultants. In the new scheme, Davey said, the Arts Council would have to reduce its staff, so the system needed to be light , flexible and fit for purpose. He stressed that a firm set of plans was some way off but imagined a self-assessment process in which organisations would write honestly - on as little as one sheet of paper - about their strengths and weaknesses in artistic excellence ambition , audience engagement and finance management. That would then be appraised by an inspector in the case of a small arts group, or a high-powered team in the case of a large national body. For example, English National Opera might be inspected by the artistic director of Op 00e9ra de Lyon, as part of a team that would also include a business leader. The inspectors would regularly watch performances and then visit for an intense study, perhaps once every three years. They might spend a day or two days in depth , in the organisation, speaking to all kinds of people in and outside of the organisation, testing the self-assessment and at the end of the process they will tell us and the organisation what they think, Davey said. It wouldn't be a 200-page report - it would be something short and snappy. Two problems which arise from the process could be: will self-assessing companies be honest , and will inspectors be honest? McMaster recently told an audience that the most difficult thing in peer group assessment was peers telling other artists that they're crap. Davey said he believed good arts organisations would be realistic , and it would foster a culture of honest assessment. What we've got to do is make sure everyone learns a new way of behaviour and a new kind of honesty that is not based around competition , he said. If we start this happening all around the system , because people will all be assessing one another I believe - and maybe I'm being a little idealistic here - you'll get a change of behaviour and attitude towards the whole thing. At the moment people are probably defensive and worried about competitiveness. He said the inspectors would have to see a range of performances over several months. Just because one or two shows are bad doesn't mean a company is failing , because the company might be trying to innovate, and one of the things that should be looked at is the scale of artistic ambition. Scotland has just begun a new system of self-assessment and inspection for its arts organisations , which includes show reports by designated inspectors which are posted on the internet. Davey was undecided about doing the same - organisations would be more inclined to report problems if they were not posted on the internet for all to see, he said. The Arts Council says one model that will not return is the old panel system, whereby the same old faces would cast judgment on different arts organisations. People who knew the system tell me that towards the end it became a little bit discredited , it became a little bit cliquey, said Davey. The plan is to have a new system in place by the time of the next spending review in 2010-11. Despite Arts Council protestations , the last funding round was widely condemned as a mess and Lady Genista McIntosh, former head of the Royal Opera House, is compiling a report looking into what went wrong. Once the new plans are formulated Davey has promised a real dialogue with arts practitioners and organisations to make the new system work.  ",

Not only does that make them a worthwhile group to target for advertisers, but Hispanic millennials are more active on digital media than any other group, especially on social media and mobile device activity. Popsugar Latina has already found a sponsor: J.C. Penney. Read MoreThe new power of millennial Hispanics The way to capture Hispanic millennial attention is to use technology, which is why many media companies are adding new digital experiences specifically for this market, said Marla Skiko, executive vice president and director of digital innovation at Starcom MediaVest Group's multicultural division. While television still reigns supreme, Skiko pointed out that especially when it comes to Hispanic millennials, more marketers are searching for ways to complement their television advertising with online campaigns. We haven't had a year where digital advertising spending toward the Hispanic market has been down , Skiko said. What's encouraging even more marketers to reach out to Latinas more is that they no longer have to create bilingual campaigns. According to agency Sensis and ThinkNow Research's The Hispanic Millennial Project , about 56 percent of Hispanic millennials were born in the U.S. 2014a trend Popsugar also noticed among its site visitors. While Popsugar Latina will be targeted to the young Latina, it will be in English. Content will include topics like celebrity gossip, Hispanic recipes, fitness and fashion. Because it is mobile-friendly, items will be shorter, stackable content. And , although many of the stories will be bespoke for the section, it can also appear anywhere else on the Popsguar site. Our intent is to deliver the content in English , focusing on content for the Latina who considers herself to be 100 percent American and 100 percent Latina, Fieler said. It's the second generation Latina for who English is a native language , but she's still tied to her culture.

Univision Deportes and Snapchat worked together to broadcast highlights from the April USA-Mexico soccer match on Snapchat. NBCUniversal has been experimenting with various new technologies to reach the Hispanic millennial. What is really important about the Hispanic millennial market is that they are very engaged consumers , said Peter Blacker , executive vice president of digital media and emerging business at NBCUniversal. They are very engaged consumers. They are also high tech consumers and high touch. For example , Blacker pointed out that NBCUniversal found that Hispanic millennials on average watched 34 more minutes of online video than non-Hispanic millennials, and were also five times more likely to share digital content than their counterparts. NBCUniversal's Double Action app creates a second screen experience on mobile that is concurrent with what is happening on television.

It's also experimenting with virtual reality through RAVE, or its real-time augmented virtual experience. The technology will help bring Hispanic millennials closer to the red carpets during top Industry events like the Latin Billboard Awards and Telemundo's Premios Tu Mundo award show. Both digital initiatives are open to for advertiser sponsorship. The advertising community has woken up to the importance of the millennial Latina woman , Blacker said.

Greece also was a factor, as traders were generally optimistic it would reach a deal with its creditors. I'm very concerned we're going to have some sort of a corrective move here. Basically , what drives those is everybody who has access to a price chart, which is everybody, could see this as a good place to take profits off the table, said Kosar. But Dan Greenhaus , chief global strategist at BTIG, said with the Fed still unclear on when it will boost rates, the market's bias is to go higher. He said unanswered are questions on timing of the first rate hike and how many increases there could be this year. I don't think the (Fed) statement or the press conference resolved any of the issues that investors are wrestling with , he said. Stocks have been stuck in a sideways push and pull , as traders worry about the potential impact of Fed rate hikes, a Greek default, and possibly sluggish earnings.

   "input": "An appeal has been launched to save a derelict building hidden in an overgrown wood in Scotland that is described as one of the greatest modernist buildings in Europe. With its long, clean lines covered by graffiti and its concrete greyed with rainwater, St Peter's Seminary has lain in a state of ruin since it was abandoned by the Catholic church in 1980. The vast, crumbling building is accessible only by foot and, despite a number of restoration proposals over recent decades, it has been left to decay and to the vandals. It has been dubbed Scotland's shame and Scotland's creepiest building , yet a plan to turn the ruin into a hotel in 2007 was dropped because of the cost of restoration. Foreign architecture students who make pilgrimages to see St Peter's have often been unable to locate it, lost as it is inside the 140-acre Kilmahew Forest, near the small town of Cardross, about 25 miles outside Glasgow, whose great architectural scion was Charles Rennie Mackintosh. St Peter's was opened in 1966, a triumph of post-war architecture and stunningly imaginative design. But it was practically obsolete by the time it was completed, as the Catholic church had decreed in 1965 that its trainee priests should be schooled not in isolated rural havens like St Peter's, but inside the urban churches of Europe, close to those they would later serve. As a result the seminary was never fully occupied. In 1980, it briefly became a drug rehabilitation centre before its closure later that year. The Catholic church was at the forefront of modernist building works in Scotland at the time, commissioning several churches of bold radical design across the country. Many were designed by Isi Metzstein, known as Britain's answer to Frank Lloyd Wright, and Andy McMillan, who then ran the Scottish firm Gillespie, Kidd and Coia, which designed St Peter's. The seminary is now the subject of a new book: To Have and To Hold, Future of a Contested Landscape. Funded by the Scottish government and Creative Scotland, the book is the first step in an ambitious 00a310 million project to save St Peter's, turn the surrounding area into a public space and establish a new arts college there. It's not a lot of money for a project like this. There is a lot of positivity , but we are very aware we are attempting to do what we want to do in the middle of the worst recession in however long, said Angus Farquhar , the creative director of Nacionale Vitae Activa, a Scottish arts charity which has acquired the site, which is also home to a Victorian estate within its ancient woodlands which the seminary was designed to sit against. But we won't be trying a complete restoration. This isn't like the National Trust approach , where everything will be restored to its original state. This is more an intent to preserve and re-use a modern ruin. St Peter's was designed with 107 cell bedrooms for trainee priests. As we have seen with previous commercial projects, that doesn't translate into a hotel or flats. The idea was to clean up St Peter's , seal it from the elements and use it as a public arts space, treating it as one would a 19th-century castle , he said. As a skeletal form it is very powerful. There is this great sweeping form with each cell making a floating concrete plinth. The use of light is exquisite. The chapel in particular uses light and shadow and shape , where light is filtered down across these huge beams above the altar and across this curved linear wall. It's such a symbol of that period of post-war regeneration , it seems logical to use the site as living heritage for artists and the public to come into this amazing landscape, for concerts and theatre groups. It will be something very special for Scotland. In 2008 St Peter's was listed on the World Monuments Fund's list of 100 most endangered sites , but Farquhar hopes that the 00a310m fund, to be raised over the next two years, will enable restoration work to begin by 2013.

An oneiric parable set in 19th-century Patagonia, the world it depicts shimmers with a crystalline reality, a hard-edged no-man 2019s-land of sea, desert, and rock. But look closely and it dissolves into mystery. Expect no answers from Captain Gunnar Dinesen (Viggo Mortensen, far from Middle-earth), a Danish military engineer on loan to the Argentine army as it wages its campaign to exterminate the native population.

Pittaluga worries Dinesen, as does the renegade General Zuluaga, who has vanished like Joseph Conrad 2019s Kurtz into the wilderness and is rumored to be leading a band of savages while dressed as a woman.

Two, I don't know that I'm necessarily the right person for it. Three , you never say never to anything in this business, because you don't know how you're going to feel if you get approached about anything, he added , according to . That's about any future job in a Trump administration. Several other politicians have raised their hands to express interest in the job 2013 albeit a little reluctantly. Former Arizona Gov.

Gingrich previously told , If a potential president says I need you , it would be very hard for a patriotic citizen to say no.

Rick Perry officially endorsed the billionaire businessman as the people's choice on Friday and said he would be open to being Trump's running mate. I am going to be open to any way I can help. I am not going to say no , Perry told of potentially becoming the Republican vice presidential nominee. We can't afford the policies and the character of Hillary Clinton. He is not a perfect man.

All that stands in their way is a group of cybersecurity experts, who must hack into the ventilation systems and locate the weapon before it 2019s too late. This scenario is fictitious, of course, designed to allow amateur cyber security enthusiasts the chance to pit their wits against one another in the Cyber Security Challenge UK Masterclass, which took place in London in late November. However, it 2019s part of an effort to tackle a very real problem: not enough people are entering the cybersecurity workforce. 201cWe have an awful lot of cyber vacancies, as does everybody else, 201d says Budgie Dhanda, sales director of security at QinetiQ, the UK-based defense and security business that designed the biological attack scenario. The shortfall is across the board, he says, from software developers to project managers. 201cThere aren 2019t enough people out there to meet the needs of all the suppliers. 201d The talent gap is a global problem. In the U.S. alone in 2014, companies posted 49,493 jobs that require Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) certification, a major cybersecurity qualification. However, only 65,362 people are CISSP certified in total, and most of them already have jobs, according to an October report from U.S. defense giant Raytheon and the National Cyber Security Alliance (NCSA), a public-private partnership that promotes Internet security. Raytheon and NCSA focused on the younger generation, commissioning Zogby Analytics to survey 18 to 26-year olds in 12 countries around the world on their attitudes toward careers in cybersecurity. The survey found that perhaps the most important step in closing the talent gap is making millennials aware that there is such a field and that it 2019s growing. 201cThe perception 2014mostly fueled by the movie industry 2014of people sitting in dark rooms in front of glowing monitors is not what the cyber profession is all about, 201d says David Wajsgras, president of Raytheon 2019s Intelligence, Information and Services business. 201cWe need to do a better job at communicating what we do. We are engineers, policy makers, critical thinkers, and innovators. 201d Wajsgras outlined a range of ways in which the cyber industry and government were working to boost awareness among young people. He said they were aiming to enlighten teachers and career counselors about jobs in cyber, as well as getting cyber professionals into classrooms with children of all ages to run hands-on activities 201cand show students how it 2019s an exciting field to be part of. 201d The Cyber Security Challenge UK, which is funded by the British government and private companies, conducts a range of programs with young people. Robert Nowill, chairman and director of the organization, highlights CyberCenturion, a competition for 12-18 year-olds that has them analyze a virtual computer for possible vulnerabilities. CyberCenturion is modeled on CyberPatriot, a similar program in the U.S. There is also an effort to convince older people to switch careers, whether they work in a related tech field or something else entirely. Peter Clarke, the winner of the Cyber Security Challenge Masterclass in London, is a 38-year-old network engineer for a car dealer. He can now choose from a range of prizes worth over 00a3100,0, in training, university courses, and access to industry events. Entrants to previous competitions have been offered jobs with companies like QinetiQ, or even the UK 2019s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), an intelligence service. 201cComputer scientists [and] web scientists are difficult to attract because there is a lot of competition for them, and getting those CVs in the door is a struggle, 201d says David Cole, managing director of Roke Manor Research, an electronics engineering consultancy. 201cTherefore using events like [the Masterclass], which is recruitment with a difference, is a showcase to demonstrate that the UK needs the sort of talent that is on display here. 201d The Raytheon NCSA report also identified a talent 201cgap within the gap 201d: far fewer women than men are entering cybersecurity. The survey found that, globally, 33% of young men said they were more likely to consider a career in the field than they would have been a year before. That figure was 24% for women. The report suggested that much of this has to do with communication: 66% of women said that no teacher or counselor had ever discussed careers in cybersecurity with them, compared with 57% of men. 201cWe 2019re not attracting that huge swath of the population into considering this as a career, 201d says Nowill. 201cThe ones who do come in are really successful, they 2019re some of the best people. So if we can open a door and a window into getting more people into this career, that 2019s a great thing to do. 201d You may not end up saving the royal family from a biological attack, but the necessary skills are the same. 201cWe worked very hard with the [Cyber Security] Challenge to come up with what we thought was a hypothetical but potentially realistic scenario, 201d says QinetiQ 2019s Dr Dhanda. 201cIt may not necessarily be in a defense or a national security context, but the same skills [the Masterclass finalists are] learning now are just as applicable if you 2019re in a bank or a big retailer or a telco. 201d  ",

(AAP) Former London mayor Boris Johnson says the European Union is trying to unify the bloc under one authority, as did Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, in an interview with British media. Napoleon , Hitler, various people tried this out, and it ends tragically, said the outspoken Conservative politician , who is campaigning for Britain to vote to leave the European Union in a June 23 referendum. The EU is an attempt to do this by different methods , he conceded in an interview with the Daily Telegraph published late Saturday. Fundamentally what is lacking is the eternal problem , which is that there is no underlying loyalty to the idea of Europe, he said. There is no single authority that anybody respects or understands. That is causing this massive democratic void. The opposing Britain Stronger In Europe campaign was quick to react , with former cabinet minister Yvette Cooper of the Labour Party accusing Johnson of playing a nasty , nasty game , the Press Association reported. The more he flails around with this kind of hysterical claim , the more he exposes his shameful lack of judgment, she was quoted as saying. He should not try to play political games with the darkest and most sinister chapter of Europe's history. The dispute was the latest in a contest which has been seen as a struggle for the leadership of the ruling Conservative Party. Prime Minister David Cameron is likely to come under pressure to step down if the public votes next month to leave the EU. Johnson's remarks immediately elicited outrage on the part of those campaigning to remain in the EU ahead of a June 23 vote in Britain on whether to stay or leave. The stay camp described Johnson's comments as a desperate effort take the focus off the economic impact such a rupture would create and on to the more populist theme of sovereignty issues. Leave campaigners have lost the economic argument and now they are losing their moral compass , said Hilary Benn , a senior member of the Labour Party. After the horror of the Second World War , the EU helped to bring an end to centuries of conflict in Europe. And for Boris Johnson to make this comparison is both offensive and desperate. Another leading figure in the out campaign , the nationalist UKIP party leader Nigel Farage, compared Johnson to former US President Ronald Reagan and rejected suggestions he wasn't serious enough to be Britain's prime minister. Boris goes on surprising people , Farage told the Mail on Sunday. They say he can't do this , he's a joker - it's like Ronnie Reagan. Could he do it? Yes.  ",

But in 2004, after five years of living in Manhattan and four years studying electrical engineering and computer science at the University of Michigan, he had to return home to Kuala Lumpur. 201cAmerica is a hard place to get a visa, 201d he said. Transitioning back was difficult. Malaysia didn 2019t have the same start-up tech culture as New York and he was lonely. He missed his colleagues, his friends and the life he had in America. 201cIt was very different and much, much harder, 201d he said. The resolution: To travel back as much as possible. Today, 40-year-old Lakhiani is the co-founder and chief executive officer of Mindvalley, a $40m in revenue education technology business that creates apps, online academies and books related to health and personal growth. When he first made the 15,000-mile-move back to Malaysia, he visited New York every three months. Now it 2019s every six weeks and could become more frequent as his business grows stateside. Lakhiani finds the 25-hour flight is a respite from his busy days. It 2019s the only chunk of time that he can read a book or watch a movie. He also started flying business class two years ago. The extra $2,000 per ticket is worth it, he said, because he 2019s far more awake and relaxed when he lands. 201cIt 2019s like going to a spa, 201d he said about the long flight. The 25-hour flight is a respite from his busy days. He also feels energised when he lands in New York. The city still has that same unbridled energy it did when Lakhiani left 12 years ago, he said.

When Lakhiani returned to Malaysia, there was barely a business community. The country itself was also far less developed. So he set out to create a mini-NYC in Kuala Lumpur. He hired Americans to come work in Malaysia by promising plenty of holiday time to explore Asia and an all-expenses-paid trip to Bali. Lakhiani also built a sprawling Silicon Valley-like office, the likes of which most Malaysians had never seen. Lakhiani began trying to foster entrepreneurship by meeting regularly with local entrepreneurs. He held hackathons 2014 events where software developers work together to create computer programs 2014 invested in other businesses and did whatever he could to make Malaysia 2019s business culture more like America 2019s. 201cBecause I couldn 2019t just pick up and move I decided, rather than leave, let 2019s mould a little part of Malaysia into the world I want it to be, 201d Lakhiani said. Malaysian [executives] aren 2019t nearly as vocal or as extroverted as Americans and class matters here. He also had to get used to the Malaysian culture again. At home, people are much shyer and introverted, he said, making it harder to strike up a conversation. In New York, and America in general, he observed, everyone 2019s far more friendly and open. General business culture is different, too. In Asia, the hierarchy is much more top down, where the manager or the CEO wields more power and acts like it, too. While that does exist in America, there are also many companies that are more collaborative and allow employees to have a say. That 2019s the kind of company Lakhiani wanted to build. 201cMy style is a lot more democratic, 201d he said. In Malaysia, Lakhiani is mindful of the communication gap and class. 201cMalaysian [executives] aren 2019t nearly as vocal or as extroverted as Americans, 201d he said, 201cand class matters here. 201d Taxi drivers and waiters, for instance, won 2019t speak to someone as an equal, he said, but rather as someone 201cabove them. 201d Travelling to New York regularly isn 2019t without its challenges. Lakhiani typically stays for two weeks, which means he 2019s away from his wife and two young children, aged 8 and 2, for long stretches. 201cThat 2019s the hardest part, 201d he said. He stays in touch via Facebook and Skype video conferences every two days. That 2019s one positive change since Lakhiani first started travelling. Then, video conferencing was for boardrooms only. Lakhiani also takes interesting videos of New York and uploads them to his son 2019s Facebook page. 201cI was in Times Square and a filmed a little video of the beauty of it and why I love it so much, 201d for instance, he said. Splitting his time between Kuala Lumpur and New York also makes it a challenge to be away from the office. When he 2019s in Malaysia, as CEO, he 2019s in back-to-back meetings. In New York, where 2019s most of his time is now spent promoting his recent book The Code of the Extraordinary Mind, his schedule as an author is more relaxed. I learned to question the traditional rules of the world I grew up in. But the time difference means he 2019s awake when his staff is sleeping. He has a team that can make decisions when he 2019s not around, Lakhiani said, but he also makes extensive use of Slack, an instant-messaging-collaboration program that helps people talk to each other in real-time. If someone has a question for him, he can quickly fire back an answer. No matter where he is, Lakhiani makes a point to get seven hours of sleep a night. When he 2019s home in Malaysia, he wakes up at 7:30 every day, has breakfast with his kids and takes them to the school bus stop. He arrives at the office at 10:00. 201cI have about 17 meetings a day, and they 2019re about 25 minutes each, 201d he said. 201cIt 2019s fast-paced. 201d He leaves the office at 19:00 and then goes home for dinner and family time before another 90 minutes of work at night. Lakhiani goes to bed at half past midnight. 201cI 2019m religious about it, 201d he said, and then it 2019s back to the grind the next day. I love the fact that I get to be in a different country every six weeks. It 2019s a different story in New York, where he mostly goes with the flow. 201cI sometimes go to bed at 2:00, but then I have to wake up at 9:00, 201d Lakhiani said. He always stays at the Citizen M hotel when he 2019s in town, which is located between two subway stations and has a lobby that doubles as a start-up-like co-working space. 201cIt 2019s like a cool Silicon Valley office, 201d he said. All of his experiences in New York has made his life easier in Malaysia, he said. The city has taught him three main things: 201cI learned to appreciate diversity and thrive in it, I learned to question the traditional rules of the world I grew up in and I learned to discard useless cultural and religious dogmas that held me back, 201d he said. Despite the challenges of being constantly between two cities, he refuses to cut down on travel. 201cI wouldn 2019t do this if it wasn 2019t exciting and fun, 201d Lakhiani said. 201cI love the fact that I get to be in a different country every six weeks. 201d To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.

Ford F recently paid $199,950 to an individual who has bought and sold nearly a dozen Tesla TSLA Model S vehicles. Perhaps most surprisingly, Ford paid about $55,000 more than the sticker price on the Model X just to get its hands on Tesla 2019s crossover. 201cIt is a common industry practice among many automakers to buy production vehicles for testing as soon as they are released, 201d a Ford spokesman tells Fortune. 201cSometimes, this means automakers pay more than sticker price to acquire them as quickly as possible. 201d Indeed, Ford is among many companies in the automobile industry to buy competitor cars. Rather than buy the cars from competitors directly, however, the companies often buy new vehicles from brokers who have all the bells and whistles carmakers would want to analyze as they look at what the competition is developing. Get Data Sheet, Fortune 2019s technology newsletter. According to Bloomberg, which earlier reported on the buy, Ford bought the 64th Model X to have come off the production line. The car is a Founders Series and sports all of the features Tesla offers, including a Ludicrous Speed Upgrade package allowing the SUV to go from zero to 60 miles per hour in 3.2 seconds, Bloomberg says. Ford currently offers one electric vehicle, called the Ford Focus Electric, a compact vehicle. However, Ford announced in December that it 2019s planning to invest $4.5 billion in 201celectrified vehicle solutions. 201d The auto maker added that it plans to have 13 201celectrified 201d cars on the road by 2020. Some of those cars will be completely electric, like those from Tesla. While it 2019s unclear exactly what Ford might be doing with the Tesla Model X it bought, it 2019s not uncommon for a company to completely tear down its purchase. In fact, most automakers, after buying a competitor 2019s car, will tear it down piece by piece to see how it 2019s constructed and what kind of engineering decisions were made. Before that happens, the cars are typically driven around and tinkered with. All along, the companies are gaining intelligence on their competitors. For more about the Tesla Model X, watch: So far, Ford is the only company known to have picked up a Tesla. But chances are, if companies buying competitor cars really is rampant in that industry and given Tesla 2019s standing in the burgeoning electric vehicle market, it 2019s not the only one looking under Tesla 2019s hood.

   "input": "WASHINGTON 2013 They may not have settled the enduring debate over whether gray hair makes a person look distinguished or just plain old, but scientists have identified for the first time a gene behind graying hair. Researchers said on Tuesday an analysis of DNA from more than 6,300 people from five Latin American countries enabled them to pinpoint a gene that affects a person 2019s likelihood of getting gray hair. The gene, called IRF4, is involved in regulating melanin, the pigment responsible for hair color as well as the color of the skin and eyes. People with a certain version of the gene are predisposed to hair graying, according to University College London human geneticist Andres Ruiz-Linares, one of the researchers in the study published in the journal Nature Communications. The researchers said hair graying is not driven exclusively by genetics, with other factors in the mix such as stress or experiencing a traumatic event. 201cThis is really the first study on the genetics of hair graying in humans, 201d University College London statistical geneticist Kaustubh Adhikari said. People spend a lot of time and money dyeing gray hair back to their natural hair color. The researchers said identifying this gene could offer a path forward for developing a treatment that could prevent or reverse graying. 201cA drug that has effects on the melanin-production pathway in hair follicles as the follicles develop internally might reduce the need to apply external hair dyes on the scalp hair after it comes out. This is certainly a research avenue worth pursuing, 201d Kaustubh said. The researchers combed through genetic information from men and women in Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Mexico and Peru, with a combination of European, Native American and African ancestry. The gene variant predisposing people to early hair graying was essentially only seen in those of European ancestry. 201cThis might, to some extent, explain why hair graying is more common in Europeans than in other populations, 201d Ruiz-Linares said. One of the researchers brushed aside the issue of whether or not gray hair is attractive. 201cPersonally I don 2019t have much of a view regarding the social response to hair graying, but I find it an interesting model to study aging in general, 201d said Desmond Tobin, a hair follicle and pigmentation biologist at Britain 2019s University of Bradford.

As time passed, Possien noticed he was being charged a strange $2.00 monthly fee. Turns out it was a 201cbad address fee. 201d 201cI called [my credit union] and they promptly refunded the fees, 201d he says. 201cBut my main complaint was that they didn 2019t call or e-mail me about the problem. 201d A 201cbad address fee 201d may be uncommon, but banks and credit unions charging fees unbeknownst to their customers are not. A report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) says that in 2006 consumers paid over $36 billion in fees associated with checking and savings accounts. 201cThere are fees for everything but breathing the air in the bank, 201d says Ed Mierzwinski, a consumer program director at the U.S. PIRG, the federation of state Public Interest Research Groups. Some of the most common fees 2013and typically most costly for consumers 2013are non-sufficient (or insufficient) fund (NSF) fees and fees associated with overdraft protection programs. Every bank or credit union is different, but typically you are charged a standard NSF fee when you don 2019t have enough money in your account to make a purchase with a check, debit card or ATM card. If the bank doesn 2019t deny your debit or ATM card, they might cover the transaction but then charge you. For example, Citibank charges a $34 insufficient funds fee for each separate time you overdraw your checking account 2013capped at four times a day. Bank of America 2018s charge is $35 each time you overdraft. Many banks and credit unions also offer what is typically called overdraft protection. Any decent bank will offer overdraft protection free to those who enroll in the service and link their accounts. With overdraft protection, the bank will still charge you for overdrafting, but it 2019s typically a lot less (which is why it 2019s generally called 201cprotection 201d). For example, if you have overdraft protection at Citibank, your account is overdrawn and you don 2019t move more funds into your account that day yourself, Citibank will transfer funds into your account from a linked account (typically a line of credit or savings account). The transfer fee is $10 and the transfer to cover overdraft is rounded to the nearest $100 to offer a 201ccushion 201d for additional transactions that may post the following day. The amount you could pay in overdraft and NSF fees adds up, and most of the time it 2019s not really worth it. A 2007 study by the Center for Responsible Lending (CRL), a bipartisan organization in Washington, D.C., found the median debit overdraft is on a purchase of only about $20. And the median overdraft loan for a debt card transaction is about $2.00 for every dollar borrowed. Overdraft fees also seem to be getting more prevalent. The 2008 GAO report found that the average overdraft fee has risen by about 11% (after inflation adjustments) from 2000 to 2007. A report by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. says 86% of banks have either an automated overdraft service or a simpler 2018line of credit 2019 program. The report speculates a few reasons for a rise; an increase in electronic banking makes it easier to charge overdraft fees. Also more banks automatically enroll you in overdraft protection programs. There is a lot of disagreement over the value of overdraft fees. Banks see them as a service to their customer: 201cWe provide a number of services that allow consumers to avoid or greatly reduce the cost of overdrafts, 201d says Elizabeth Fogarty, vice president of public affairs at Citi . Others, like Eric Halperin, a director at the CRL, don 2019t. 201c[Banks] are making a lot of money off of [overdraft fees], 201d says Halperin. 201cIt 2019s a very safe loan for them. 201d Many consumer advocate groups feel strongly that banks and credit unions charge too much in overdraft fees, and do so in an unfair way. They view it as a serious enough problem that it is being addressed in Washington, D.C., quite forcefully. Representative Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., has introduced the 201cConsumer Overdraft Protection Fair Practices Act 201d (H.R. 1456), which would require that consumers are notified at an ATM or when using a debit card to make a purchase if they are about to overdraft, so they choose whether or not to go forward with the transaction. The bill had a hearing before the Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit Subcommittee of the full House Financial Services Committee a few weeks ago. While the politicians battle it out, you should focus on not paying fees. The first step is realizing their existence. There are a few realities you should be aware of, too. Purchases made in one day may not be subtracted from your account in the order you make them, rather in order of highest to lowest amounts. If you have automatic payments set up, withdrawals may not always happen on the day you expect them to. Take advantage of services offered by your bank to help you stay on top of your account. Citibank offers free e-mail and wireless alerts if you get near to overdrawing your account. Bank of America offers 41 different alerts you can set yourself. Most major banks also have online banking that allows you to transfer funds 24 7. In terms of other fees, ask your bank to provide you with a list; you have the right to know all the fees your bank is, or could be, charging you. There are many small monthly service fees you could potentially be charged. For example, you don 2019t maintain a specific balance in your account. If you feel that you 2019ve been charged unfairly, call your bank and speak with them. As in the case with Possien, sometimes they will understand your situation and reimburse you. The best strategy is to be smart; there are only so many times you can ask your bank for forgiveness. There sure is something to be said for learning how to balance a checkbook or at least be mildly aware of how much money you have in your account before you spend. A $6 six-pack could turn into a $50 beer bust. Comments are turned off for this post.  ",

Many women show signs of depression months after having a baby, and those who initially appeared the least likely to develop depression were later found to be at the highest risk, a study published in the Annals of Family Medicine found. Researchers analyzed data from 1,432 women across the U.S., about a third of whom were first-time mothers. The women were asked to rate from 0 (none) to 3 (daily) their feelings of sadness, lack of appetite, thoughts of self-harm and other symptoms. Those with total scores of 10 or higher were identified as at-risk. All of the women scored below 10 in their first screening, conducted four to 12 weeks after giving birth. Six months after giving birth, 10.9% of the women scored 10 or higher, and a year in, 16.9% of women did. Though the American Academy of Pediatrics and American College of Nurse Midwives have advocated for regular screenings of postpartum depression during primary care visits, the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force has said they worry about the repercussions of possible misdiagnoses on women and children.

Starbucks SBUX on Thursday reported a stellar fiscal third quarter report that sent the company 2019s shares to fresh all-time highs. Same-store sales were up 8% globally, bolstered by a 9% increase in the U.S. as traffic dramatically increased. All regions performed well, and for the upcoming fiscal 2014 Starbucks projected revenue will increase about 10% to 13% bolstered by new store openings and growth as existing locations. But the coffee giant 2019s executives talked more about investments in mobile rather than discuss the latest coffee or tea brews. That 2019s because Starbucks says investments in the mobile experience, including a growing loyalty card program and digital payment apps, are what 2019s helping power the company 2019s growth. 201cMobile order and pay is enabling us to serve more customers more quickly and efficiently and to significantly reduce attrition off the line, 201d Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz told analysts. Starbucks tossed out a few key statistics to make its case for why investments in mobile, while costly, are a worthy expense. The 201cMy Starbucks Rewards 201d loyalty program now has 10.4 million active members, up 28% from a year ago, and those shoppers now account for about 30% of business in North America. Mobile payments account for 20% of all in-store transactions in the U.S., more than double the figure Starbucks reported two years ago. The company has also signed up recent partnerships with The New York Times, music streaming service Spotify and ride-sharing startup Lyft in an attempt to win over even more coffee and tea lovers. Schultz pointed to comments he made two years ago when he noted that traditional brick and mortar retailers needed to recognize that there was a shift in consumer behavior when it came to mobile.

This shouldn 2019t be a surprise, as Starbucks was always ahead of the curve. It introduced WiFi in its stores back in 2001, and at that time, even charged for the service (it is now free). The rationale was that if coffee lovers were using Starbucks restaurants for their Internet needs, they 2019d spend some money on drinks and food while spending time in Starbucks 2019 restaurants. Not all investments outside of the coffee experience paid off (the first WiFi provider went bankrupt and a music label shut down).

After Amazon introduced the express delivery service in Paris last week, that city 2019s mayor raised concerns about it hurting local business and increasing pollution. 201cThis operation may seriously destabilize the Parisian trade balances, 201d the city 2019s Mayor Anne Hidalgo said on Monday in a press release. Last week, Amazon announced that it would add Paris to a small list of cities with Prime Now, a two-year-old service that includes delivery of fresh and frozen food, alcohol, toys, and health care products. Customers who have Prime subscriptions can get their orders at not additional cost for two-hour delivery and an extra $7 for one-hour delivery. In preparation for Prime Now, Amazon built a new distribution center in Paris, which Hidalgo said could create gridlock for people living near the new facility. 201cThe City of Paris will be intransigent vis- 00e0-vis Amazon, 201d she said in the release. 201cThe municipality requires the US to be exemplary on its human resources policy, the amounts of pollution emitted by its delivery vehicles and on maintaining the quality of life of people living near storage center located in the eighteenth arrondissement. 201d For more on Amazon, watch: This isn 2019t the first on-demand service to face pushback in France.

   "input": "It 2019s simple. We want an Olympic Games that does not harm children and their families. We all know that the financial benefits of organising major sporting events for host countries have been disputed. Decaying Olympic stadiums in Greece have been seen as a symbol of that country 2019s economic woes, and Hamburg 2019s population even voted against a bid. But what about the impact of these events on the local population? Marquee sports events often cause human rights violations or exacerbate existing ones, with children particularly vulnerable. That includes children 2019s rights abuses. Related: Rio Olympics: view from the favelas 2013 'It is not the police's role to do social work' Data from Brazil 2019s Dial 100 service, a national hotline for reporting abuse, suggests that the number of reported violations against children increased by 17% in the 12 World Cup host cities during the 2014 competition, compared with the same month in 2013. In August, Brazil will host the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro; meanwhile, violations against children 2019s rights continue. When the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child last convened, clearances of street children in Rio ahead of the Games were reported. In order to 201cclean up 201d tourist areas for the half a million expected visitors, many street children were taken to young offenders 2019 units, where they reported violence and humiliation. In Rio, at least 4,120 families have already been evicted from their homes, while a further 2,486 are threatened with forced removals to make way for projects directly or indirectly associated with the Games. For thousands of children, the dream of the Rio Olympics bringing joy to all through the power of sport has not become a reality. Yet policies adopted by the International Olympic Committee have the potential to prevent and respond appropriately to the risks posed to children before, during and after the Olympic Games. With our Children Win campaign, we at Terre des Hommes are urging the IOC to prevent, mitigate, report on and respond appropriately to the full spectrum of risks posed to children throughout the Olympic cycle in line with the fundamental principles of the Games. Related: Rio Olympics: view from the favelas 2013 'We need the freedom to be ourselves' We want the IOC to implement a number of measures to ensure human rights, and especially child rights, are protected. Even at this late stage, it can act. First, the IOC should put pressure on local government to halt forced evictions in Vila Aut 00f3dromo, the favela community adjacent to the Olympic Park. The 15% who remain in this community, including children, are living in precarious conditions with no access to water and infrastructure. Any displacement as a result of Olympic infrastructure should be dealt with in accordance with international human rights norms. The clearance of street children in tourist areas must also be stopped. In the long term, we want the IOC and other sports governing bodies to adopt a human rights commitment policy under which human rights would be considered when awarding the Games to a host country and commitments made binding in the host city contract. For example, a Unicef study published in 2014, and based on data from 190 countries, showed that in 2012 Brazil had the second highest rate of child homicide, especially among young males aged 10-19. Was this taken into account when the Games were awarded? Organisations such as Fifa and the IOC should not only monitor all stages of competitions, but also enable and support more credible external, independent monitoring. From the beginning, a board should be set up to identify specific risks, such as child sexual exploitation linked to large construction sites and child labour concerns. This would increase pressure on sponsors. After all, no sponsor wants to be associated with human rights violations. The results of the bid and the subsequent monitoring process should be made public. Sports governing bodies should receive and investigate complaints, and carry out human rights due diligence. Finally, governing bodies should engage with stakeholders throughout this process, so that the views of the most vulnerable groups affected, including children, are taken on board. The Children Win campaign is committed to making the world aware of child rights violations and increasing the pressure on sports organisations like the IOC.

   "input": "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton outlined a more aggressive approach to fighting ISIS in a major speech Thursday that showcased a more hawkish approach to foreign policy than her former boss. In a closely watched speech at the Council on Foreign Relations, the Democratic frontrunner called for sending more U.S. special forces to Syria, imposing a no-fly zone in northern Syria and possibly arming Sunnis and Kurds in Iraq. The speech struck a more assertive tone than President Obama 2019s remarks on the same subject earlier this week, even as she was careful to keep from directly criticizing the current strategy. 201cIt is in many ways an intensification, an acceleration of the strategy, 201d Clinton said of her plan to attack and destroy ISIS. 201cThere has been an evolution in their threat and we have to meet it. 201d Clinton 2019s vote in favor of the Iraq War divided her and Obama in the 2008 election and was a decisive reason she lost the nomination. She has said repeatedly the vote was a mistake, but her reputation as being more aggressive on foreign policy issues than the president has not changed. In her time as Secretary of State, she called for more action to arm moderate Syrian rebels, and was a voice for more intervention in Libya. Their differences may be amplified by their current positions too. Nearing the end of his second term and facing no more elections, Obama has grown increasingly impatient with the political side of his job, while Clinton is already looking ahead to a general election where she expects to square off against a Republican candidate who will use similarly tough rhetoric on foreign policy. During a Q&A in Turkey Monday, Obama said he wasn 2019t going to take action against ISIS simply because it would 201cmake America look tough, or make me look tough, 201d and compared critics to people who 201cwant to pop off 201d on the issue. By contrast, Clinton struck a more assertive tone in her speech. 201cOur goal is not to deter or contain ISIS, but to defeat and destroy ISIS, 201d she said. 201cAnd we should be honest about the fact that, to be successful, air strikes will have to be combined with ground forces actually taking back more territory from ISIS. 201d Read More: Transcript of Clinton 2019s Speech on Fighting ISIS She said that U.S. troops may need to take a greater role and more flexbility in Iraq and Syria, including in embedding in local units and helping target airstrikes. 201cAs part of that process, we may have to give our own troops advising and training the Iraqis greater freedom of movement and flexibility, including embedding in local units and helping target airstrikes, 201d she said. Clinton has also called for a no-fly zone in northern Syria, a policy that some critics including Robert Gates have said would be tough to implement. Back in familiar territory three years after leaving her post as Secretary of State, Clinton 2019s understanding of the nuances in the Middle East were clear on Thursday. She parsed the complicated relationships in the region with familiarity, calling on Turkey to overcome its animosity towards the Kurds, for example. She detailed how she would convince Saudi Arabia to turn its attention from the Shiite Houthis to joining a coalition against ISIS. She also called for better intelligence sharing between European countries and the United States, and warned that impenetrable encryption of mobile communications of the kind being developed in Silicon Valley could make it more difficult to prevent a future attack. 201cThe United States and our allies need to know and share the identities of every fighter who has traveled to Syria, 201d Clinton said. Clinton also joined Obama in criticizing Republicans for calling for Syrian refugees to be denied access to the United States. Since the Paris attacks, GOP presidential candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio have argued that the U.S. can 2019t reliably run background checks on incoming refugees, while Chris Christie has even said he wouldn 2019t allow orphan children to enter. 201cAfter a major terrorist attack, every society faces a choice between fear and resolve, 201d Clinton said. 201cTurning away orphans, applying a religious test, discriminating against Muslims, slamming the door on every single Syrian refugee 2013 that is just not who we are.

   "input": "Some customers didn 2019t know what to make of Samantha Briody when they saw her behind the parts counter at AutoZone in Weymouth. 201cIs there a guy here? 201d they would ask. Little did they know how well equipped she was to help them. Briody,21, recently graduated with a bachelor 2019s degree in automotive management from the Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology in Boston, and just started a new position as a parts specialist at a Volkswagen dealership in Norwood. But dealing with gender stereotypes is likely to remain part of her job. Even as the number of women taking automotive classes has remained steady or risen in schools around New England, the share of them working as mechanics and in auto parts sales has declined in recent years 2014 reflecting a drop in females in many male-dominated industries. But with technicians in demand, and women drivers outnumbering men, the automotive industry is doing more to attract women to the field 2014 and keep them there. The Automotive Women 2019s Alliance Foundation and the Car Care Council Women 2019s Board have attracted more corporate sponsorships in recent years, allowing them to greatly increase the number of scholarships they award. Car makers, including General Motors Co., the first major automotive company to have a female chief executive, have laid out plans to recruit and better support female employees. And the Automotive Industries Association of Canada released a report last month detailing the challenges women face in the industry and recommending ways to increase their numbers. Automotive employers who come to the Benjamin Franklin Institute are increasingly seeking out women, especially to interact with customers, said Ashley Mansfield, director of student success at the school. With women involved in 80 percent of car-buying decisions, according to the research and consulting firm Frost & Sullivan, it makes sense to have more of them working in the industry, she said, not just to make female customers comfortable, but to capitalize on their communication and problem-solving skills and attention to detail. Women make up only about 10 percent of approximately 150 automotive students at the Benjamin Franklin Institute, and to combat this lack of community, Mansfield recently helped form a women 2019s group where students meet to share stories of discrimination, hear from women in the industry, and travel to trade shows. The women at the school may be far outnumbered by men, but they are serious about their education. 201cThe guys at the school just talk about how fast their cars are and don 2019t actually pay attention to the lesson, 201d said Cassie Olson, an 18-year-old Shrewsbury native who grew up helping her dad change the oil and is getting an associate 2019s degree in automotive technology. 201cThe women actually want to hear the lecture. 201d Diane Larson of Larson 2019s Service in Peabody says the business can still be tough for women. Once they get out into the male-dominated workforce, however, many don 2019t last. The share of female mechanics has fallen 3 percentage points in the past 20 years, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In wholesale and retail auto parts, the percentage of women has dropped by a similar amount. The number of women in managerial positions in the auto industry has also dipped. This decline reflects an overall decrease in the number of women in traditionally male fields over the past few decades, including agriculture, coal mining, and manufacturing. The reason for this, said Anna Beninger, director of research at the women 2019s advocacy group Catalyst Inc., boils down to company culture. 201cThe old boy 2019s club is alive and well, 201d she said. The gender gap is not limited to blue-collar jobs. Women who enter STEM fields 2014 science, technology, engineering, and math 2014 often start in lower-level positions and make less money than men from day one, said Beninger, who studied the gender divide among nearly 6,000 MBA graduates. Of those who do go into automotive, high tech, manufacturing, and other male-dominated fields, 53 percent of women left to work in another industry 2014 compared to 31 percent of men 2014 because they feel like outsiders, lack female role models, and experience both overt and unconscious discrimination. But some areas of the automotive industry are retaining more female workers than in the past, including automobile sales. 201cIt 2019s not the sons, it 2019s the daughters who are taking over the businesses, 201d said Melissa Steffy, general manager of Herb Chambers BMW of Boston. And as cars become increasingly computerized, and the 201cgrease monkey 201d stigma fades, repair work will become more accessible for women, too, said Kellie Treppa, a member of the Automotive Women 2019s Alliance Foundation board. 201cBrains can do it; you don 2019t necessarily need the brawn, 201d she said. Diane Larson helped her husband open Larson 2019s Service in Peabody 30 years ago and took over the business after he died in 2008. Customers don 2019t hang up when she answers the phone like they used to, she said, but the industry can still be a tough place for women. When she was at a trade show with the 21-year-old son of another shop owner a few years ago, vendors automatically directed their comments to him. But Larson 2019s shop is thriving, due in part to the innovative way she runs it. Customers come to her service station twice a year for prescheduled checkups, similar to a dentist 2019s office. This brings in regular business and keeps clients 2019 cars from breaking down. Women in particular love it. 201cYou 2019re not going to end up with a dead battery or a light out or a fan belt breaking, 201d Larson said. Incorporating women 2019s ideas are good for the industry, said Larson, who is grooming her female shop manager to take over in a few years. Larson 2019s manager, Taylor Hill,30, who has a degree in automotive management, said she was initially discouraged from getting into car repair. 201cIt 2019s a guy 2019s world, 201d she recalls her father telling her. 201cYou don 2019t want to deal with the hassle. 201d It hasn 2019t been that bad, Hill said, but she has had to develop a thick skin 2014 and to consider what it means when a man doubts her abilities. 201cIt 2019s more of an insecurity issue on their part, 201d she said, 201cbecause they may not know as much as I do. 201d  ",

A spread in Rolling Stone magazine won 2019t hurt, either. That 2019s what happened to Bert Kreischer during his sixth year at Florida State University back in the late 1990s. He got a call 2014 as he was in the middle of doing bong hits, naturally 2014 from a magazine journalist interested in writing about FSU after it had been anointed the country 2019s top party school. Kreischer 2019s name had been mentioned by nearly every student the writer had spoken with as someone who knew his way around a bash. The resulting article, called 201cThe Undergraduate, 201d which detailed Kreischer 2019s out-of-control drinking, merrymaking and public nudity, made him a star 2014 and inspired the 2002 Ryan Reynolds movie 201cNational Lampoon 2019s Van Wilder. 201d 201cI 2019ve never seen it. I had nothing to do with it, 201d Kreischer, now 41 and a stand-up comedian and TV personality, says of the frat comedy. Kreischer is responsible for 201cLife of the Party: Stories of a Perpetual Man-Child, 201d a collection of outrageous anecdotes, on sale May 27. In it, he writes about his unpredictable, Forrest Gump-ian life, including the time he was briefly in a band with the dude from Creed, and the time he cried on Whitney Houston 2019s shoulder while his daughter had dental surgery. 201cHere 2019s the weird thing about me. I was never one to tell you stories about me. I was always the guy who others told stories about, 201d Kreischer tells The Post. 201cI was like that up until I was 35 years old. And then I started telling stories about me onstage. 201d Kreischer has plenty of stories that never made it into the movie. Here, he shares tales from some of his wildest nights of partying, including a few from the days when he lived in New York. I was working at the Boston Comedy Club [on West Third Street], standing out front 201cbarking, 201d trying to bring people in to watch our comedy show. Tracy Morgan came out of the club. He asked me if I wanted to go get high. We took a left and walked down the block, to either Thompson or Sullivan. Tracy lit [a joint], and he passed it to me. I said, 201cThis tastes funny. 201d He tells me, 201cOh, it 2019s wet. 201d 201cOh, it 2019s PCP. 201d Then he walks away. I 2019m like, 201cWhat the f- -k? 201d I 2019m spiraling. I ask my friend [comedian] Tony Woods, and he said, 201cNo, Tracy doesn 2019t smoke PCP. You 2019re fine. 201d I 2019m like, 201cSeriously? 201d Tony said, 201cListen, don 2019t go home. If you go home, you 2019ll think you 2019re on PCP. 201d So now you 2019re in that gray area where you literally feel high with anxiety, and you 2019re spiraling because there is the possibility that you smoked PCP. The truth is, I was just a young, white comic, and I know for a fact that Tracy has a history of messing with young, white comics. They all come to me with their stories: 201cYou should have heard what he did to me. 201d Later, Tony and I went over to Madame X [on Houston Street]. Tracy was there holding court [with 20 guys]. We drank a ton of Champagne and I had some Heineken. When the bill came, the waitress gave it to me [because I was the only white guy in the group]. I 2019m freaking out. Tracy got up and caused somewhat of a ruckus. 201cAh, f- -k that. I 2019m the rich [N-word] in here! F- -k that white boy, he works the door, 201d he said. Tracy ripped off his shirt and the bouncers were on top of him. Tony and I go outside. Tracy comes out and he looks like he 2019s been beaten. But he 2019s sly as a fox. He looks at me and Tony and goes, 201cNow that 2019s how you get out of paying the check. 201d I suffer from an inability not to grab the mic. I 2019m the guy who needs to be front and center. I joined a fraternity to do that. The frat elections were such bulls- -t. So catty. What would happen is, I 2019d grab the mic and use it as an opportunity to get laughs. I 2019d write a song about the brothers or something. One time, I went up totally naked with a tie on and delivered a speech that said I had nothing to hide. That was my platform. It killed, and it killed because once the shock of me being naked wore off, I 2019m still delivering a nine-minute speech naked. And I 2019m not really well-endowed, so it became almost surreal to these guys. The next year, my buddies ask me, 201cAre you gonna do a naked speech? 201d I said, 201cI would, but I 2019m afraid I 2019ll s- -t all over the place. 201d They 2019re like, 201cThat 2019s perfect! 201d So we go and get a tie. They go up and give a speech about how I 2019m trying to change, how I 2019m trying to become more of a serious person. Then I come up and I 2019m naked and the guys love it. I go up and raise my hand and turn around to face a table of councilmen, and I push and I s- -t on a pizza box. The council didn 2019t see me s- -tting. All the council saw was me pissing on their feet. Because when you go number two, you also go number one. That 2019s why they call it number two: It 2019s number one plus another number one. I piss all over their feet and they lose it. Then, they smell it. All hell was breaking loose. I swear to you, there were people jumping out of windows. Even me, when I had to clean it up, I gagged. Later, we go in to tally up the votes, and they force the two candidates to stand next to each other, and everyone is still talking about the s- -t , and I 2019m standing next to [the other candidate] and he 2019s in a suit and tie with a laser pointer and I 2019m naked. They tally it up and I won by a landslide. [The other candidate] yells, 201cThat 2019s bulls- -t! 201d And someone else from the back yells, 201cNo, that 2019s Bert s- -t! 201d When Oliver Stone optioned the rights to my life, and they were trying to develop a movie based on my life, there was this agent who set me up with writers, and they were going to write the script. These two writers had a great pitch, but they kept saying, 201cWe don 2019t know how the story ends. We want to know how it ends. 201d One night, we go over to the Argyle [now called Sunset Tower, in West Hollywood], and they 2019ve rented the penthouse suite. We walk in and there 2019s a ton of coke on the table. They go, 201cYou party, right? 201d I didn 2019t say no at the time. Then, very quickly I realized they were trying to kill me so that they 2019d have an end to the story. I go out on this tiny balcony overlooking Hollywood, and I think, 201cI need to get the f- -k out of here. 201d My first night in New York ever, I went down to the Meatpacking District and a journalist friend named Steve Garbarino showed me my first gay bar. We went to an after-hours club called Marylou 2019s, and this guy recognized me. He said, 201cYou 2019re the party animal! I just read about you. I got to get you a drink! 201d I went, 201cNo, no. That 2019s OK. 201d I was just being coy. He called over to his friends, 201cHarvey, Abel, you gotta meet this guy. He 2019s the No. 1 party animal. 201d I 2019m looking, and the girl we 2019re with goes, 201cHoly s 2013 -t! I can 2019t believe David Lee Roth wants to buy you a drink. 201d That was my first night in New York. The most f- -ked up I 2019ve been and, hands down, one of the favorite moments of my life, was St. Paddy 2019s Day my first senior year. I had two senior years and two junior years. I 2019m at Potbelly 2019s bar and get a call on the bar phone. My buddy says he 2019s coming by. He pulls up on a scooter, and he goes, 201cI got a bag of mushrooms. Let 2019s go. 201d I eat the mushrooms and sit backward on the scooter so I am facing traffic. We proceed to drive through the campus at a slow speed, and it was literally one of the most beautiful days I 2019ve ever had in my entire life. It was giggly fun and very peaceful. And just beautiful. We 2019d drive around and I 2019d say, 201cLet 2019s go see if we can get a corn dog inside the Tri Delt house. 201d It was that kind of energy.  ",

   "input": "The Office of Personnel Management has revised its estimate for the number of fingerprint records compromised in cyberattacks that recently targeted the agency, the office announced on Wednesday. The agency (commonly abbreviated as 201cOPM 201d), which serves as a human resources department for the federal government, has upped its figure to 5.6 million stolen fingerprint records from its original estimate of 1.1 million. The higher figure does not affect the estimated number of federal employees who had their sensitive information, such as social security numbers and SF-86 security clearance forms, compromised in the attacks, OPM said in its news release. That figure remains pegged at 21.5 million. As a means of authentication, biometric indicators such as fingerprints have made inroads in the past couple of years as a promising alternative to passwords, which can be difficult to remember and are often improperly 2014and weakly 2014applied by users. In 2013, for instance, Apple AAPL introduced its touch ID device-locking tech as a substitute for personal identification numbers with the launch of its iPhone 5s. The feature has been included on all the latest iPhone and iPad models since. The OPM revelation exposes a major flaw lurking in fingerprint-protected systems though. People can easily change their passwords; they can 2019t easily change their fingerprints. 201cFederal experts believe that, as of now, the ability to misuse fingerprint data is limited, 201d the agency said in a statement. 201cHowever, this probability could change over time as technology evolves. 201d Fortune requested elaboration on this point. An OPM spokesperson replied via email: 201cThe law enforcement and intelligence communities are best positioned to give the most fulsome answer to this question. 201d Government security experts will team up to investigate the issue and devise future protections, the office said. This group includes members from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Defense, and other members of the intelligence community. Unfortunately, no amount of free credit monitoring nor identity theft protection can un-steal fingerprint data. Senator Ben Sasse told Fortune via email that the latest news 201cis the clearest sign yet that the administration still acts like the OPM hack is a PR crisis instead of a national security threat. The American people have no reason to believe that they 2019ve heard the full story and every reason to believe that Washington assumes they are too stupid or preoccupied to care about cyber security. 201d Many security experts have attributed the OPM attacks to China. Ironically, given the news, Chinese president Xi Jinping is currently touring the U.S., visiting tech companies, and engaging with top officials in discussions about cybercrime and espionage.

Muhammad Waseem said he gave a 201ctablet 201d to Baloch to subdue her and then strangled her in their family home over the weekend. 201cI have no regrets, 201d he told journalists in a press conference arranged by the police early on Sunday. The killing sent shockwaves across Muslim Pakistan and triggered an outpouring of grief on social media for Baloch, whose real name was Fauzia Azeem. Violence Against Women Could Cost the U.S. $500 Billion a Year In Facebook FB posts, Baloch,26, spoke of trying to change 201cthe typical orthodox mindset 201d of people in Pakistan. She faced frequent misogynist abuse and death threats but continued to post provocative pictures and videos. 201cAs per our initial investigation 2018honor 2019 is the motive of murder, 201d said Azhar Ikram, the police chief in Multan, where Baloch was killed.

Waseem said he killed his sister due to her social media activities, which included a series of posts with a prominent Muslim cleric, Abdul Qavi. One video shows her sitting on the cleric 2019s lap. Qavi, who was suspended from a prominent Muslim council in the controversy following the posts, told local media after Baloch 2019s death he had 201cforgiven her 201d and the matter was now in God 2019s hands. How Women in Turkey are Using an App to Fight Domestic Violence After Baloch 2019s death, many Pakistanis again called for the passage of an anti-honor killing law, aimed a closing a loophole that allows family members to forgive the killers. 201cThe death of Qandeel Baloch conveys an insidious message: that women will be kept back at all cost; murdered, if they dare nurture ambitions to break the glass ceiling, 201d the English daily Dawn newspaper wrote in an editorial on Sunday. 201cHer murder 2026must serve as an impetus for legislators to renew demands for legislation to protect women who are threatened under false notions of 2018honor 2019. 201d Baloch, who called herself a modern day feminist, was described as Pakistan 2019s Kim Kardashian and built a modeling career on the back of her social media fame. 201cAs women we must stand up for ourselves.

She also appeared in a music video, gyrating bare legged to an Urdu-language song in high-heels and a see-through top. Prior to her death Baloch spoke of worries about her safety and had appealed to the interior ministry to provide her with security for protection. No help was provided and the interior ministry has not commented on her death. On social media, some celebrated her killing as she had been a 201cdisgrace 201d to Pakistan 2019s culture.

   "input": "Making matters more challenging for Democrats is that the rural, Democratic-leaning parts of the state have suffered significant population losses over the last decade. The biggest declines have been in the most heavily Democratic majority-black counties along the Mississippi River. The state 2019s Republican-leaning areas have had significant population growth since 2000; the state 2019s Democratic-leaning areas have suffered steady population losses. The state 2019s most Democratic and black county, Phillips, exemplifies this trend. Phillips County gave Mark Pryor 65 percent of the vote in 2002, but its population shrank by 18 percent over the last decade 2014 the second-largest decline in the state. When Mr. Pryor first won his Senate seat, the five fast-growing Republican-leaning metropolitan counties held 19.9 percent of the state 2019s population. They now hold 25.6 percent of it. Democratic-leaning counties where Mr. Pryor received at least 60 percent of the vote now represent just 21.5 percent of the population, compared with 23.4 in 2000. And the voters who remain in these Democratic-leaning areas are not as Democratic as they once were. Not only have many decidedly turned against the national Democratic Party, but a large percentage of the most Democratic voters have left the electorate. The so-called Greatest Generation of older voters, who came of age when Dixiecrats still reigned in the South, were the most reliably Democratic cohort in Arkansas. Voters over 65 even voted for John Kerry, according to the exit polls. The 201cGreatest Generation, 201d people who were young adults during the World War II era, represented 11 percent of voters nationally in 2002, according to the Current Population Survey. Now in their late 80s or older, they represented just 2.4 percent of the electorate in 2012. The broader group of voters who were at least 65 years old in 2002 represented 23 percent of voters in that election, but now at age 75 or older had shrunk to just 9 percent of the vote in 2012. Largely taking the place of the 201cGreatest Generation 201d as the oldest voter group is the so-called Silent Generation, people born roughly from the mid-1920s to the mid-1940s. These voters are far less attached to the Democrats, and although their longtime memories of Mark Pryor and his father will allow Mr. Pryor to fare far better than President Obama did, it is hard to imagine that Mr. Pryor could run up the score among older voters the way he could have a decade ago 2014 even if he were just as popular and even if national conditions were just as favorable. The rise of the Silent Generation is a big part of why Democrats struggle more with midterm elections than they did a decade and a half ago. Many of these pro-Republican trends exist in other Southern states. But in Arkansas, there are virtually no trends working in the direction of Democrats. The white share of the electorate barely declined at all between 2004 and 2012, falling from 84.1 to 83 percent, according to the census 2019 Current Population Survey. It 2019s possible that the actual decline was greater, but it is nonetheless clear that the Arkansas electorate has not become significantly more diverse over the last decade, even though the white share of the voting-eligible population has declined modestly. Given those trends, Mr. Pryor would be hard pressed to win re-election in Arkansas today, even under better circumstances. That 2014 is an off-year election with the incumbent Democratic president extremely unpopular in Arkansas only makes matters worse. Democrats say that Mr. Pryor still has a credible path to victory. But the polls don 2019t really show it: Mr. Pryor is stuck in the low to mid-40s, trailing Mr. Cotton by a modest but consistent margin. Very few candidates 2014 let alone Democrats running in a state as conservative as Arkansas 2014 manage to come back from numbers like these. To the extent that the polls offer any cause for Democrats to be optimistic, it is that some have shown Mr. Pryor faring much better among registered voters than likely voters. Some surveys even show Mr. Pryor ahead among registered voters. If Mr. Pryor does indeed lead among registered voters 2014 which is not at all clear 2014 then Democrats can hope that a strong turnout operation could get many of these voters to the polls. It is a glimmer of hope, but not a bright one: Leo, The Upshot 2019s Senate forecasting model, gives Mr. Pryor a 24 percent chance of winning.  ",

   "input": "Donald Trump is set to deliver his acceptance speech for the Republican nomination Thursday night in Cleveland. Behind his words will be 30-year-old policy adviser Stephen Miller, who is tasked with drafting the speech of his life. If it weren 2019t difficult enough to produce a blockbuster address for the most unpredictable Republican nominee in modern memory, Mr. Miller will need to shoulder the additional scrutiny foisted on the candidate after his campaign admitted on Wednesday that parts of the convention speech his wife delivered Monday were drawn from an earlier address given by Michelle Obama. A writer in the Trump Organization, Meredith McIver, took responsibility for the speech. 201cThis was my mistake and I feel terrible for the chaos I have caused Melania and the Trumps, as well as to Mrs. Obama, 201d she said in a statement. Mr. Miller, who spent nine years on Capitol Hill before joining the campaign in January, feels a close connection to Mr. Trump 2019s words. 201cI remember saying a few years ago to friends that I hoped Donald Trump would run for president, 201d Mr. Miller said in an interview. 201cThe clarity with which he talked about trade and immigration, and the sense that he alone had the power to disrupt the special interests and give government back to Americans, made clear to me that he was the leader we needed. 201d Campaign officials say that Mr. Miller, more than anyone else on the campaign, has achieved a mind-meld with the candidate, capable of channeling Mr. Trump 2019s blunt, short sentences into well-argued addresses with stylistic flourish. 201cStephen is one of the most important people in the campaign, 201d said Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort. 201cHe clearly understands Mr. Trump 2019s voice. 201d Growing up in a liberal Jewish family in Santa Monica, Calif., Mr. Miller quickly realized that his conservative views, if impeccably argued, would gain him notice far beyond the scope of his hometown. In high school, Mr. Miller was known to contact conservative talk-radio personalities when he perceived liberal bias tainting his education, such as the time a co-principal broadcast over the school 2019s public-address system his doubts about launching airstrikes on the Taliban. Before joining Mr. Trump 2019s operation, he spent seven years serving as a communications and speech writing adviser to Sen. Jeff Sessions (R., Ala.), one of the chamber 2019s most conservative members and one whose protectionist trade and immigration views mirror Mr. Trump 2019s. 201cWhen I hear Trump speak, I often hear Stephen speaking, especially when he talks about immigration and trade, 201d said one House staffer who worked with Mr. Miller on immigration policy while he was with Mr. Sessions. The Alabama senator became one of the most influential voices against overhauling the immigration system, helping catalyze GOP opposition to it in the House in 2013 after a bipartisan bill passed the Senate. On the Hill, Mr. Miller became known as a zealous messenger of Mr. Sessions 2019s views, sending out an unusually high volume of notices flagging the senator 2019s speeches on the issue. On at least one occasion, Mr. Miller asked a reporter to read Mr. Sessions 2019s 25-page immigration handbook, which Mr. Miller helped write, before responding to narrower questions. Mr. Miller has crafted many of Mr. Trump 2019s most important policy speeches delivered with a teleprompter, going as far back as the speech Mr. Trump delivered to a pro-Israel group in March, Mr. Manafort said. That address marked one of the first occasions where Mr. Trump 2019s remarks adhered to a straightforward argumentative structure. But it is perhaps Mr. Miller 2019s own brash, straightforward style 2014even more than his views on Mr. Trump 2019s marquee campaign issues 2014that makes him the ideal envoy of the candidate 2019s message. Mr. Miller has been warming up crowds at Mr. Trump 2019s rallies since March, a routine that began in Florida with a blistering takedown of Sen. Marco Rubio, one of Mr. Trump 2019s primary opponents, who had been one of the architects of the 2013 immigration bill. 201cMarco Rubio campaigned for office in 2010 and he campaigned on a pledge that he was going to fight amnesty. Did Marco Rubio fight against amnesty? 201d Mr. Miller asked a crowd in Boca Raton. That returned raucous calls of 201cNo! 201d This week, the Melania Trump speech 2014which Mr. Manafort said Mr. Miller wasn 2019t involved in drafting 2014adds an extra challenge to Mr. Miller 2019s task. 201cUnder any circumstances, he 2019d be under a lot of pressure, 201d said Matt Latimer, a former speechwriter to President George W. Bush. 201cBut after the Melania Trump debacle, every word of that speech is going to be scrutinized. If the pressure was at 100, now it 2019s at 110. 201d Writing for a candidate like Mr. Trump could also come with other challenges, speechwriters say. 201cIt 2019s nearly impossible to write for such a mercurial candidate, because by definition they don 2019t want to give prepared speeches that sound like canned political boilerplate, 201d said Barton Swaim, a speechwriter for Rep. Mark Sanford when he was governor of South Carolina. Mr. Trump has been known to veer off script, but Mr. Miller said the candidate closely edits his own speeches. 201cHis words have given hope to so many who 2019ve been waiting for a reason to hope, 201d he said. 201cHis words are his own, and that is their power. 201d  ",

   "input": "On Monday, Wenche Elizabeth Amtzen, the presiding judge, said that Breivik's statement would take 30 minutes. In the event, he was afforded over an hour. Justice Amtzen interrupted four times to demand restraint, but Breivik was never silenced. So Norwegians had to listen as he claimed that a concern for human rights and international law had led him to detonate a car bomb in the centre of their capital , before carrying out the Utoya island massacre. This was the most sophisticated and spectacular political attack committed in Europe since the Second World War , boasted Breivik. If one can force the Norwegian Labour party to change their immigration policy by executing 77 people , that will contribute to holding our values and culture. Reading a 20-page statement that he had spent months preparing in prison , Breivik looked directly at the judges. I acted in defence of my culture and of my people and so I ask to be acquitted , he said. Earlier , he had turned on the media, denouncing 100 per cent of the world's news organisations for pumping out multicultural propaganda 24 hours a day. Inexplicably , they were also portraying him as a pathetic and mean loser without integrity. With a special tone of indignation , Breivik added: It has been suggested that I'm a child-killer despite not being indicted for killing anyone under the age of 14. He would have preferred to bomb a journalists' conference in Oslo , but unfortunately that attack had been impossible to organise in time. Numerous figures from history had inspired his struggle as a Knight Templar , said Breivik, singling out Sitting Bull, the native American chief who defeated General Custer at the Battle of Little Bighorn, and Enoch Powell, the late Conservative politician. Recalling Powell's infamous speech from 1968, Breivik said: Enoch Powell predicted that rivers of blood would flow through our streets. Unfortunately no-one listened to him , or to the other Enoch Powells in Europe. Britain came up repeatedly during Breivik's testimony. Luton was a city where the indigenous population and even emergency vehicles were unable to enter large areas , allegedly because of the depradations of Muslim immigrants. And three out of five Englishmen believe the UK has turned into a dysfunctional society because of multiculturalism , added Breivik , citing an opinion poll which he said had appeared in The Times in 2010. The Knights Templar had been founded in London in 2002 , he claimed, although the prosecution believe this network to be a figment of his imagination. Turning to American inspirations, Breivik lamented that Europe had never possessed an anti-Communist like McCarthy to prevent Marxists from infiltrating universities and schools. He added: McCarthy was far too moderate. He thought about deporting all American Communists to the Soviet Union , but unfortunately he did not do so. Yet Breivik had encountered a problem that generations of extremists , particularly Marxists, would recognise. The majority of people are so indoctrinated that they do not believe they need to be saved , he complained. After venting his phobias unchallenged , Breivik,33, finally faced cross-examination. Inga Bejer Engh, the softly spoken prosecutor, did not attempt a bruising confrontation in the style of the Old Bailey. Instead, she politely and persistently tied Breivik in knots. Who gave you the authority to take the lives of Norwegians? she asked. Breivik squirmed around this question for the best part of 20 minutes before confessing that he gave himself the mandate to kill Norwegians in order to rescue them. As for Breivik's own past , Ms Engh forced him to admit that all of his various business ventures were hopeless failures until, at last, he set up an internet company selling fake diplomas, yielding a profit of Pounds 436,000. Peddling forged certificates was, he admitted, morally despicable. Along the way , Breivik had also evaded taxes, dodged Norway's compulsory military service, invented a story about having his nose broken by a Muslim, and lied about gaining a business degree from an American university. After dropping out of secondary school, the killer claimed to have spent 15, 000 hours in private study to remedy his lack of formal education. And what , asked the prosecutor , was your main source of information? Breivik's answer was emphatic: Wikipedia , he said. The English articles there contained a lot of information. When he became an ultra-nationalist , he described himself as rising to be commander of a cell of the Knights Templar. Under questioning , he admitted that he was the sole member of the cell he commanded. There were, apparently, two other one-man cells in Norway. The Knights Templar itself was formed by a meeting of four sweaty men in a basement in London , he said. How did his various statements describe this gathering? They pompously called it an inaugural rally , he said. The aim was to defend Christian civilisation from the incoming tide of Muslim migrants. But Ms Engh brough Breivik's flow of rhetoric to an abrupt halt by asking: Do you consider yourself a Protestant? After a long pause , he replied: I have not been a religious person , but there's a proverb that there are no atheists in the trenches. I'm a member of the Church of Norway, but I'm more drawn towards the Catholic church. Again and again , Breivik returned to the subject of his lack of education. It's important to signal that one is not without knowledge , he said. You could see me as a salesman: I sell ideology , a view of life. Devoid of shame about massacring defenceless teenagers , Breivik appears tormented by his failure to go to university. The case continues with another four days of his testimony.  ",

Former centre-back Pressley, who was previously in charge of Coventry and Falkirk, had signed 10 players this summer ahead of the new campaign.

On Wednesday, Trump retweeted and then deleted a message from the dubiously named user WhiteGenocideTM. The message was innocuous enough 2014the user was complimenting the crowds the GOP front-runner routinely receives on the stump 2014 but the messenger is hard to ignore. WhiteGenocideTM 2019s account features the image of George Lincoln Rockwell, the founder of the American Nazi Party, along with the phrase 201cthe man who would be Hitler. 201d It also lists the user 2019s location as 201cJewmerica, 201d and includes links to other hateful, anti-Semitic and racist content, including insulting tweets about Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and a link to a documentary questioning the validity of the Holocaust. And this is not the first time Trump has retweeted a message from WhiteGenocideTM. In late January, he shared an image the user posted of Jeb Bush superimposed on the body of what appears to be a panhandler, holding a sign that reads: 201cVote Trump. 201d That tweet had not been removed from Trump 2019s account as of Thursday. MSNBC reached out to the Trump campaign for comment on the WhiteGenocideTM retweets but has not heard back at this time. In the past, Trump has been criticized for sharing racially insensitive messages and sentiments on social media. Last October, he tweeted his thanks to a Dutch white supremacist who sang his praises. (That profile asks: 201cRace war, when? 201d) Then in November, he retweeted debunked crime statistics that incorrectly claimed black Americans committed 81 percent of murders against white victims in 2014. FBI statistics show that in actuality 82 percent of white murder victims were killed by white assailants. 201cI retweeted somebody that was supposedly an expert, 201d Trump told Fox News host Bill O 2019Reilly afterwards. 201cBill, am I gonna check every statistic? 201d 201cAll it was is a retweet, 201d Trump added. 201cIt wasn 2019t from me. 201d RELATED: The danger of Donald Trump The next month, when British citizens proposed he be banned from their country via a petition, Trump encouraged his supporters to read the writings of U.K. conservative and former 201cApprentice 201d cast-member Katie Hopkins. Hopkins has compared migrants to 201dcockroaches 201d and 201cferal humans 201d and was reportedly investigated for 201cinciting racial hatred 201d in early 2015. Last year, when two of his supporters attacked a homeless man and reportedly said, 201dDonald Trump was right, all these illegals need to be deported 201d while they were doing it, the real estate mogul simply said that his backers are 201cvery passionate. 201d And in November of last year, when he was asked if his call for a database where all Muslim Americans would need to be registered was reminiscent of Nazi policies, Trump responded: 201cYou tell me. 201d In the past, Trump has professed to have enjoyed a great relationship with 201cthe blacks, 201d and he has spoken (albeit with the requisite degree of controversy) to Jewish groups.

The American National Super PAC, a white nationalist organization founded by American Freedom Party chairman William Daniel Johnson, conducted pro-Trump robocalls during the run-up to the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary. 201cWe don 2019t need Muslims. We need smart, well-educated white people, 201d a voice said in one New Hampshire robocall. 201cI am a farmer and a white nationalist. Support Donald Trump, 201d another said. The Trump campaign has yet to disavow or comment publicly on these robocalls, although the candidate himself has repeatedly lamented the fact that there is 201ctoo much 201d political correctness in the U.S. 201cMost white people would prefer to live in majority white neighborhoods and send their children to majority white schools. And deep in their bones, they are deeply disturbed by an immigration policy that is making the United States majority non-white, 201d Jared Taylor, an editor at the white nationalist media outlet American Renaissance and one of the voices on the robocalls, recently told CNN. 201cSo when Donald Trump talks about sending out all the illegals, building a wall and a moratorium on Islamic immigration, that 2019s very appealing to a lot of ordinary white people. 201d And Trump is not the only 2016 Republican getting support from uncomfortable corners of the electorate. Earlier in this campaign cycle, Trump 2019s rivals Sens.

   "input": "Despite Russian reassurances that Moscow 2019s troop buildup along Ukraine 2019s eastern frontier is for a military exercise, its growing scale is making U.S. officials nervous about its ultimate aim. President Barack Obama on Friday urged Russia to stop 201cintimidating 201d Ukraine and to pull its troops back to 201cde-escalate the situation. 201d He told CBS that the troop buildup may 201cbe an effort to intimidate Ukraine, or it may be that [Russia has] additional plans. 201d Pentagon officials say they believe there could be close to 50,000 Russian troops bordering the former Soviet republic and inside Crimea, recently seized and annexed by Moscow. That estimate is double earlier assessments, and means Russian President Vladimir Putin could order a lighting strike into Ukrainian territory with the forces already in place. The higher troop count was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. 201cWe continue to see the Russian military reinforce units on their side of the border with Ukraine to the south and to the east of Ukraine, 201d Rear Admiral John Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, said Thursday. 201cThey continue to reinforce and it continues to be unclear exactly what the intent there is. 201d State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf played down the notion that there are as many as 100,000 Russian troops now bordering Ukraine, as Olexander Motsyk, the Ukrainian ambassador to the U.S., said Thursday on Capitol Hill. 201cI hadn 2019t actually seen the hundred-thousand number, 201d Harf said. 201cThere are huge numbers of Russian troops on the Ukrainian border. 2026 We are concerned about Russia taking further escalatory steps with whatever number of tens of thousands of troops they have there, and have called on them not to do so. 201d Washington got those assurances that the Russian troop buildup was only an exercise from Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu a week ago. But no one in the U.S. government knows if Putin agrees 2014or if the Russian leader has changed his mind as the West has debated what level of economic and political sanctions might be imposed if Moscow takes an additional chunk of Ukraine beyond Crimea. 201cThey made it clear that their intent was to do exercises and not to cross the border, 201d Kirby said. 201cOur expectation is they 2019re going to live up to that word. 201d There is no plan to involve the U.S. military in what is happening in Ukraine, even if Russia takes more territory. Ukraine borders Russia, and Ukraine does not belong to NATO, where an attack on one member is deemed to be an attack on all. 201cShould the Russians continue to move aggressively in that region and in the Ukraine, what does that mean 2014and NATO would have to respond, for example 2014what would that mean for the United States Army? 201d Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, asked the Army 2019s top officer Thursday. 201cMy responsibility is to make sure that the U.S. Army is prepared to respond as part of a joint force, as part of NATO, 201d General Ray Odierno, the Army chief of staff, responded. 201cSo what I 2019m focused on is improving our readiness in combat, combat service support and combat aviation capabilities to make sure we 2019re ready to respond whether it 2019s from a humanitarian assistance aspect or any other aspect. 201d How many of the 67,000 U.S. troops in Europe might be involved? 201cI simply don 2019t know, 201d Odierno said. 201cAnd I would just remind people that, actually, some of the soldiers that are assigned to Europe actually right now are in Afghanistan. 201d Lawmakers suggested that the world is abandoning Ukraine. 201cIt appears to me Ukraine was left defenseless over the last two decades, 201d said Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio. 201cUkraine has stood with us both in Iraq and Afghanistan, 201d added Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-N.J. 201cWe 2019re highly appreciative and recognize their sacrifice. 201d The U.S. has made plain it is not rushing military aid of any kind to Ukraine, despite Kiev 2019s requests. Ukraine has sought lethal military aid 2014small arms and ammunition 2014but that is off the table. 201cThe rations, the Meals Ready to Eat, they are on the way, 201d Kirby said. 201cWe expect them to arrive in Ukraine probably by the weekend is the best estimate. They 2019re going over land. 201d Obama stressed Thursday that economic and political sanctions would be the primary weapons the international community would be brandishing to curb Russian aggression against Ukraine. 201cI 2019ve been very clear in saying that we are going to do everything we can to support Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, 201d he said in Rome. 201cBut I think that it 2019s also important for us not to promise and then not be able to deliver. 201d  ",

   "input": "David Tannenbaum, a lawyer turned startup executive, had been in chemotherapy for a brain tumor for almost a year when, in January 2015, he had two strokes that left him partly paralyzed on his right side. After months of traditional physical therapy, and still partly paralyzed, Mr. Tannenbaum turned to a videogame for help. He used a device at NYU Langone Medical Center in which an interactive, on-screen canoe trip retrains the paralyzed hand and brain in basic movements. New therapeutic devices for stroke recovery, made possible by advances in hardware and software, are transforming the typically low-tech world of stroke rehabilitation. Though the tools are still in the early stages, doctors say that they can be more motivating and engaging for patients than current standard therapies, and that they hold promise for stroke survivors who are too injured for traditional therapy. 201cWe 2019re entering a very exciting era, 201d says Dr. David Putrino, director of telemedicine at the Burke Medical Research Institute in White Plains, N.Y. 201cAll of these new tools can really help us do our jobs much better. 201d Strokes, which cause brain damage, are a major cause of death and disability in the U.S. Most survivors have some type of disability, and at least half are affected severely enough to require special care or a long-term facility. While existing stroke therapies are useful, patients typically don 2019t get as much of these therapies as their doctors would like, both in the hospital and after they leave. It 2019s especially difficult to get patients to follow through on therapy routines in the long term, in part because the routines are often repetitive and tedious. The new methods, in contrast, are more engaging for the patients, and some can be done at home. What 2019s more, while most stroke therapy works by exercising the part of the body associated with the injured portion of the brain, some of the new therapies take a different approach. For instance, the simulated canoeing device at NYU Langone 2014which is undergoing clinical trials 2014engages both arms simultaneously in an effort to retrain the paralyzed hand and the affected portion of the brain. The design is based on research findings by its inventors that using an uninjured arm can help in retraining the injured one. Their research suggests that both sides of the brain are involved in one arm 2019s movement, says Preeti Raghavan, a doctor at New York-based NYU Langone who, along with Dr. Donald Weisz, a former professor at Mount Sinai Medical Center, developed the therapeutic device through their company, Mirrored Motion Works Inc. Mr. Tannenbaum 2019s experience speaks to the device 2019s effectiveness at getting him to stick with his therapy. 201cTwo minutes in, you forget you 2019re doing exercise and you feel like you 2019re playing a game, 201d he says. Mr. Tannenbaum says that since his stroke he has regained some abilities, including the ability to walk and move his right arm up and down. Among the newest therapeutic tools used for stroke victims, those most commercially available are robotic exoskeletons, which attach directly to the affected part of the body to facilitate or enable movement. Robotic exoskeletons are well suited to therapy, since the support can be taken away gradually as patients improve, says Karen Nolan, a senior research scientist at the nonprofit Kessler Foundation, a West Orange, N.J., research and charitable institution for people with disabilities. Exoskeletons also may relieve physical therapists of having to manually move the patients, so they can focus on the quality of the movements instead, says Dr. Nolan. Another approach, called telerehabilitation, aims to increase the amount of therapy stroke patients get by making supervised rehabilitation available at home 2014and making it fun at the same time. One system, developed by Steven Cramer, a University of California, Irvine, professor, and his team, integrates low-cost electronic videogame plug-ins, such as a Nintendo NTDOY -0.55 % Wii remote-controlled gun. Users 2019 movements control the games, with remote supervision by a therapist. 201cPeople get all freaky jazzed when they shoot the little ducky on the screen, 201d Dr. Cramer says. The system is in clinical trials to test its effectiveness compared with in-person physical therapy. Videogame technology used in stroke therapy also includes virtual-reality systems, with some that render scenes and objects in 3-D. Some games with immersive environments may offer the greatest promise to stroke patients because they address cognitive problems along with sensory and motor problems, says Dr. Mindy Levin, a professor at McGill University in Montreal and president of the International Society for Virtual Rehabilitation. While stroke patients often have physical difficulty with such basic tasks as shopping, everyday environments such as malls can leave them feeling overwhelmed as well. A simulation developed by Israeli researcher and occupational therapist Dr. Debbie Rand, called VMall, can help reintroduce patients to such environments in a low-stakes way by capturing the patient 2019s image and movements and placing them in an on-screen virtual mall, where they look for items on a shopping list. The future of these technologies likely lies in a multifaceted approach that combines exercise, therapy and medication, says Lee Schwamm, director of stroke services at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and a professor at Harvard Medical School. In addition to exploring the value of videogame devices such as the Wii and Microsoft MSFT 0.17 % 2019s Kinect for rehabilitative purposes, Dr. Schwamm says he would like to see what can be achieved using more everyday consumer technology, such as Fitbits, the wearable devices that encourage users to be active by monitoring their movements and vital signs. Users also can make the data available online to compare numbers and compete with others. Researchers are still determining how to match each patient with the technology he or she would benefit most from, depending on the nature and severity of the injury. Canadian clinical guidelines, for instance, recommend robotic exoskeletons for the shoulder and elbow but not for the wrist and hand, based on patient outcomes seen in a review of research. There 2019s also a question about how insurers will cover treatments in this burgeoning field. Not all of these new products are available for patient in-home use, and some concerns remain about the effectiveness of those that are. 201cIf it helps, it helps, but it 2019s a young field, 201d Dr. Cramer says. 201cMost of these devices have yet to publish solid, well-powered, persuasive clinical studies that establish these things do something reliably, in a consistent way. 201d It 2019s possible that using all the new approaches together could provide maximal effect, says Leonardo Cohen, chief of neuroplasticity and neurorehabilitation at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the National Institutes of Health. 201cIt 2019s conceivable, if each of them improves learning by 5%, maybe when one administers them all together, it has an additive effect, 201d Dr. Cohen says. 201cI don 2019t know that, but it would be interesting to explore. 201d Ms. Court is a reporter for MarketWatch in New York.

   "input": "Cartoonist Jack Davis, the long-time legendary artist on the US magazine Mad , has died at the age of 91. Davis, who also created posters for films such as The Long Goodbye and Bananas, was one of the founding artists on the publication in 1952. He contributed to the magazine for several decades, drawing many portraits of its mascot Alfred E Neuman. Mad art director Sam Viviano said Davis' immediately recognisable style revolutionised comic illustration. A spokesman for the magazine , which began as a comic book in 1952, said a list of his most legendary pieces would run to several pages in length. He added: Among his most iconic parodies from Mad's comic book days are of The Lone Ranger and High Noon. From the magazine , his notable parodies include spoofs of Raiders of the Lost Ark, Gone with the Wind, and M*A*S*H. The magazine's editor John Ficarra said there wasn't anything Jack couldn't do. Front covers , caricatures, sports scenes, monsters - his comedic range was just incredible. His ability to put energy and motion into his drawings , his use of cross-hatching and brush work, and his bold use of colour made him truly one of the greats. Davis began his career at the University of Georgia , where he drew for the campus newspaper - his depictions of the athletics teams, the Georgia Bulldogs, still grace the walls of the institution. The university's alumni association tweeted that Davis would be missed by the Bulldog family. Georgia radio station WGAU said Davis' first success after university was to illustrate a Coca-Cola training manual , a job that gave him enough cash to buy a car and drive to New York. Once there , he worked as a freelance cartoonist, before finding a role with EC Comics, contributing to a number of their titles, including Tales From The Crypt and Incredible Science Fiction. The editors of those titles - William M Gaines, Albert B Feldstein and Harvey Kurtzman - went on to launch Mad, which Davis contributed to from the start as one of the Usual Gang of Idiots , the magazine's spokesman said. Away from the magazine, Davis drew posters for films and designed a stamp for the US Postal Service in 1989, breaking the rule banning the portrayal of living people by sneaking in a self-portrait. He received the National Cartoonists Society's Milton Caniff Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996 and the Reuben Award in 2000 and was inducted into the Will Eisner Hall of Fame in 2003. Celebrities and fellow cartoonists paid tribute to Davis online. The Monkees' drummer Micky Dolenz retweeted a picture Davis had drawn of the group, while author Neil Gaiman said Davis was so wonderful and a legend. Marvel comic book writer Brian Michael Bendis described Davis as one of the greatest cartoonists that ever lived , The Walking Dead artist Tony Moore said he was a consummate professional and gentleman and Gremlins director Joe Dante called him the Maddest of the Mad artists. Davis' final cover for the magazine came in 1995 - a picture of magazine mascot Neuman plunging radio presenter Howard Stern in a toilet bowl , which the spokesman said remains a Mad classic. Ficarra said Davis would always be remembered for his charming modesty and Southern gentleman manner , which completely belied his rascally sense of humour and wry wit. Everyone at Mad and DC Entertainment send their heartfelt condolences to Jack's wife , Dena, and the entire Davis family, he added.

   "input": "Facebook has been trying to copy Snapchat for so long it has become a kind of running gag in tech circles. The social networking giant started trying to duplicate the ephemeral-messaging app 2019s core features even before it offered $3 billion in a failed bid to buy the company in 2013. And the reason why says a lot about what makes the service so powerful. The latest copy cat attempt came on Tuesday, when Facebook-owned Instagram introduced a new feature called Stories that lets users share a collection of photos and videos that disappears after 24 hours. The new offering is fundamentally identical to Snapchat 2019s Stories, right down to the name. Depending on how you count, this is the fourth or fifth such move by Facebook FB . The first was an app called Poke, which offered messages that disappeared automatically. It was released in 2012 and shut down in 2014. In 2013, Instagram premiered Instagram Direct, a private-messaging feature, and in 2014 Facebook debuted an app called Slingshot, which it also later mothballed. Each of these attempts has tried to imitate one or more of Snapchat 2019s core features: 1) It is private, and therefore there are no public likes or favorites or comments, and 2) Its messages are 201cephemeral, 201d which means that they automatically disappear after a specified period of time. In the early days, those attributes meant Snapchat was dismissed by many observers as a 201csexting 201d app, designed to allow teens or twenty-somethings to send intimate photos. But it turned out to be far more powerful than just that, which in turn has helped the company raise multiple rounds of funding, to the point where its theoretical market value is now $19 billion. Get Data Sheet, Fortune 2019s technology newsletter. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom put his finger on one of the things that has made Snapchat 2019s features so appealing to younger users. He admitted that his company 2019s new feature was essentially a copy of Snapchat, and said that this was because 201cwe need to have a place where you feel free to post whatever you want without the nagging fear of, did someone like that or not? 201d Although the Instagram CEO didn 2019t provide any figures on Instagram sharing, the Journal quoted from internal documents that said more than half of all teen users of the app delete their posts if they don 2019t get enough likes or favorites. In other words, the fact that updates are public creates a kind of performance anxiety for many users, something Facebook and Twitter users have also mentioned. Snapchat you used far more per day; once you shared a single Instagram photo, that was it, you didn't want to overdo. Insta had to fix this. 2014 Daniel Roberts (@readDanwrite) August 2, 2016 Posts on Snapchat, by contrast, don 2019t have any public likes or favorites or comments, or follower counts. Justin Kan, who sold his streaming-video startup Twitch to Amazon for $1 billion in 2014, pointed out in a Medium post earlier this year that a lot of the social and psychological friction that other services have simply isn 2019t there with Snapchat. And as a result, engagement levels are much higher. On Snapchat, the frictional cost is low: the content doesn 2019t have to be that good, because it is going to disappear anyways, and everyone else 2019s content isn 2019t that great either. There 2019s no public view count, follower count, likes count, or any other social dick-measuring contest. The only problem for Snapchat is that messages that disappear automatically aren 2019t a great environment for advertising, or for creating content that is engaging across a broader cross-section of users 2014something that Instagram has proven to be very good at. That 2019s why Snapchat has created newer features such as Discover, which features media content; and Memories, where users can save posts and stories. Snapchat just raised almost $2 billion in funding. Watch: Many younger users don 2019t seem to have any interest in these other features, however. They simply want to continue sharing their private photo and video messages without any pressure to perform or to rack up likes and followers. Can Instagram convince them that its new Stories feature is good for that as well, or will it just seem like a shameless copy-cat with no ideas of its own? In a sense, Snapchat wants to become a little more like Instagram so that it can appeal to advertisers, while Instagram wants to become a bit more like Snapchat so that it can lure younger users who don 2019t like the social pressure of a public feed. Which one reaches its goal first remains to be seen 2014and there are tens of billions of dollars in value resting on the outcome.  ",

   "input": "SALZBURG, Austria 2014 Thomas Ad 00e8s 2019s new opera, 201cThe Exterminating Angel, 201d based on the surreal 1962 Luis Bu 00f1uel film, had its premiere at the Salzburg Festival on July 28; it arrives at the Metropolitan Opera next year. One of the great composers of his generation, Mr. Ad 00e8s,45, has written only two previous operas 2014 201cPowder Her Face 201d (1995) and 201cThe Tempest 201d (2003) 2014 so this was a major event. In the story, members of an entitled elite inured to societal injustices enter a mansion for a lavish dinner party and become psychologically trapped there. I wrote that Mr. Ad 00e8s 2019s score was 201cexceptionally inventive and audacious, 201d and many other reviews were just as positive: The London Observer called it 201ca momentous evening: a turning point for Ad 00e8s and, it felt, for opera itself. 201d A few days after the premiere, I spoke with Mr. Ad 00e8s at the festival about adaptations, cuts and his future plans. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. When you did 201cThe Tempest, 201d you said in advance that this was a Shakespeare play and you were taking it and doing what you wanted with it and making it yours. It literally was the case that it wouldn 2019t have been possible to do it otherwise. Maybe I shouldn 2019t have. But like it or lump it. But 201cThe Exterminating Angel 201d is a classic movie. It 2019s the only version out there. That must be more intimidating. You 2019re quite right, although any movie has a relationship with its screenplay. And there was a play before. And there are actually many different versions of the screenplay. We stick fairly closely to the movie in terms of the order of incidents. We stick fairly closely to the final screenplay. But I amplified some things that in a way are suppressed in the final film. [Bu 00f1uel] was making it under very difficult circumstances, in exile in Mexico. He didn 2019t have access to many of the things he wanted. So in some ways, I was able to bring it back. Also the difference is that the film 2014 one of its great qualities 2014 is played, a lot of it, very low-key, so dialogue is all on one level. And absolutely no music. The acting, with certain exceptions, is quite restrained. With an opera, one 2019s doing in a way the opposite and bringing out the latent psychological and emotional meaning. The music underlines the power of the feeling. In some ways, I found that operatic subjects, whether it 2019s a source that you use or a real-life thing, are subjects that seem to invite a further dimension that in a way would bring them to some kind of new stature. Well, what 2019s happening to the characters in this film is horrifying. Yet, as you said, Bu 00f1uel plays it with detachment. But you chose to show some of that horror. Music can do that: The orchestra tells you what 2019s really going on. I 2019ve enjoyed that with it. Because you 2019re quite right, it is a horror in every way. But it 2019s also, I think, much of the time, I was finding how funny it is, the deluded nature of what they 2019re saying could be very, very funny, and the music could bring out both sides perhaps of that as well. The piece will travel to other houses. Is it fixed? Are you tinkering? I 2019m not sure. There might be a couple what you call director 2019s cuts. The very first draft was very much longer. Just in the process of finalizing, several things hit the cutting floor. At the moment, I 2019m not feeling their loss particularly. I 2019ll almost certainly tinker with some of it, just, we call it, going around the chassis and tightening a few nuts and bolts. It must be said that I do feel the thing is now there as a living, breathing organism. So there 2019s not that much that one can do without scarring the whole. If the cuts prove to be at all jarring, you can actually make a piece seem longer. That 2019s true. I think so. But things did shift here. I did add a tiny bit right toward the end, when the chorus first comes back in. One had to feel for a split second longer that it was a happy ending. I added four bars. Seemed to sit better. One challenge for contemporary opera is writing for the voice, figuring out the relationship of the vocal line to words. Have you thought about these issues and challenges? Your first opera, of course, was 201cPowder Her Face. 201d I 2019ve had much more practice in the theater since then. I suppose one thing, I am more conscious of the dangers in terms of making music foolproof with various things that can happen in the theater. Foolproof is too strong a word. 201cPowder Her Face, 201d I was 25 or something. It 2019s quite fragile orchestration; there 2019s not a lot of doubling. It 2019s written for a smallish room, 120 people or so, so when it 2019s done in a cavernous place for 2,0, the orchestra can easily get lost. The vocal writing, there 2019s nowhere to hide. It 2019s almost like a form of pantomime in the theater. So as I 2019ve gone out, I started figuring out ways to anticipate someone 2019s having an off day. Do you have another opera in the works? I think my average of one a decade might hold. Right now, I 2019m thinking more of ballet. I think I 2019ve come to a certain point with opera. We 2019ll see. My music seems to want to go to the stage with dancers. There have been a lot of ballet versions of my pieces. Maybe I should write a ballet. Might be quite a nice change.

   "input": "In 1973, the critic Susan Sontag wrote about viewing, for the first time, photographs of World War II concentration camps: 201cOne 2019s first encounter with the photographic inventory of ultimate horror is a kind of revelation, perhaps the only revelation people are granted now, a negative epiphany. For me, it was photographs of Bergen-Belsen and Dachau which I came across by chance in a bookstore in Santa Monica in July, 1945. Nothing I have seen 2014in photographs or in real life 2014ever cut me as sharply, deeply, instantaneously. Ever since then, it has seemed plausible to me to think of my life as being divided into two parts: before I saw those photographs (I was twelve) and after. My life was changed by them, though not until several years later did I understand what they were about. 201d I had a similar feeling last week while watching, along with millions of others, Diamond Reynolds using her cellphone to broadcast via Facebook Live as her bloodied boyfriend, Philando Castile, a school cafeteria supervisor, lay dying next to her, having been shot multiple times by a policeman. 201cStay with me, 201d she says, extraordinarily calm at the beginning of what would be nearly a ten-minute live broadcast, her four-year-old daughter with her in the car, while the policeman who killed Castile is outside, his gun drawn, facing them. 201cWe got pulled over for a busted tail light in the back and the police just, he 2026 they killed my boyfriend. He 2019s licensed 2026 he 2019s licensed to carry, 201d she narrates to whomever is watching. 201cHe was trying to get out his ID and his wallet out his pocket, and he let the officer know that he was, that he had a firearm and that he was reaching for his wallet and the officer just shot him in his arm. 201d Then we watch as the policeman is heard saying, 201cMa 2019am, keep your hands where they are. 201d She responds, one of several times she refers to him as 201csir, 201d perhaps as a way not to get shot herself: 201cI will sir, no worries, I will. 201d And a bit later the officer, increasingly distraught, exclaims, 201cI told him not to reach for it! I told him to get his hands up! 201d And she has the presence to answer, 201cHe had, you told him to get his ID, sir, his driver 2019s license. Oh my God please don 2019t tell me he 2019s dead. 201d Then, for the second time, we hear the officer say 201cFuck. 201d Reynolds becomes more upset when she is handcuffed and placed in the back of a police car. We hear her daughter say, 201cThat 2019s OK mommy. 201d And then a moment later she says, 201cIt 2019s OK, I 2019m right here with you. 201d Crying, Reynolds then makes an appeal, 201cY 2019all please pray for us, Jesus, please y 2019all. I ask everybody on Facebook, everybody that 2019s watching, everybody that 2019s tuned in please pray for us. Sister I know I just dropped you off but I need you to pick me up 2026. 201d Read next: Video Shows Grisly Aftermath of Fatal Shooting of Black Man in Minnesota The viewer is horrified, and somehow complicit. We have intruded on a scene of such utter agony, and from such distance, that it feels like we must do something. But what can be done? Sontag asked a similar question concerning her experience of viewing the photographs of the concentration camps: 201cWhat good was served by seeing them? They were only photographs 2014of an event I had scarcely heard of and could do nothing to affect, of suffering I could hardly imagine and could do nothing to relieve. When I looked at those photographs, something was broken. Some limit had been reached, and not only that of horror; I felt irrevocably grieved, wounded, but a part of my feelings started to tighten; something went dead; something is still crying. 201d The lives of the survivors in that car, Diamond Reynolds and her daughter Dae 2019Anna, of the Minnesota policeman who shot and killed Castile, and of the others who were there at the scene, have been profoundly and irrevocably changed. But so have the lives of the viewers, as we watched the shooting 2019s immediate aftermath broadcast from within the vehicle, narrated and filmed by a young woman whose boyfriend was dying and whose daughter was watching during what should have been a routine traffic stop. Unlike Sontag 2019s experience, in the digital age millions of us were able to look on transfixed just as the horror was unfolding, either live or soon afterwards. What do we say to our children? What can we do other than vent our rage? How do we sleep at night? We can expect that the horrors broadcast, in order to continue to attract our attention, will become even more awful. The gauntlet is thrown, the trauma is widespread, and we are left knowing that someone, anyone, using Facebook Live, or Twitter 2019s Periscope, or a comparable app, will soon broadcast yet another horror 2014as happened only the next day when five Dallas policemen, there to protect people marching peacefully at a Black Lives Matter protest, were killed by a crazed sniper who was himself then killed by a robot with a bomb. And we can expect that the horrors broadcast, in order to continue to attract our attention, will become even more awful as happens when image is used as spectacle. In an interview on BuzzFeed after the release of the Facebook Live feature earlier this year, Mark Zuckerberg commented: 201cWe built this big technology platform so we can go and support whatever the most personal and emotional and raw and visceral ways people want to communicate are as time goes on. 201d It is doubtful that he foresaw a 26-year-old woman sitting in a car broadcasting over Facebook Live while watching her boyfriend die, or five Dallas policemen being gunned down and killed in a surprise attack the following day. Read next: Mark Zuckerberg 2019s Response to the Video of Philando Castile 2019s Shooting We also must be aware that these and similar technologies can be used by the aggressors, not only by the victims and bystanders, as has been the case with ISIS 2019s scripted decapitations and in other criminal acts. Can social media companies like Facebook do a better job of regulating these emerging episodes of horror 24 hours every day of the week, able to determine what is in the public interest with clear, enforceable ethical guidelines in place, than we as a society have done over the last several decades with the gratuitously violent and misogynistic imagery that has been all too pervasive in media? What would the impact have been on Sontag when she was a child, or on any of us, to have encountered Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen via live streaming, watching enslaved laborers toil while exterminations are in progress? Live-Streaming the Next Mass Tragedy Just a bit less than fifteen years ago on September 11,2001, the looping videos of the World Trade Center towers in flames and falling seemed to be everywhere, like a repeating nightmare from which one could never wake. The images shrieked apocalypse on a visual scale never before seen in New York City, with a transcendent blue sky providing a backdrop that made the events of that day seem even more ominous, more cold-blooded and insidious. Photographs of those fleeing the buildings appeared almost immediately, soon followed by images of the numerous handmade posters displayed by people searching for their missing friends or family. On the same day as the attacks, a photograph of the flag of the United States being raised at the ruins was published, echoing the famous World War II photograph of Iwo Jima, a quick, almost desperate answering salvo in the image war. What would it have been like if those inside the burning towers had been able to broadcast their plight to the rest of us during those last trying moments? But it was the imagery of the people falling from the high towers that was seen as the most horrific and forbidden, revealing an even more personal and visceral subtext to the events unfolding in the powerlessness of those trapped. Publishing these images was considered by many as re-victimizing the victims, and as elevating the trauma of those who knew and loved them, or could see themselves in their place. Many at that time were in shock, unable to comprehend how to move forward: there must have been something more to be said than the president 2019s advice to go shopping, or his decision soon afterwards to bomb Afghanistan. Now, with billions of pictures and videos being shared every single day, with Facebook Live and Periscope and other such live-streaming apps, we might think of what would it have been like if those inside the burning towers had been able to broadcast their plight to the rest of us during those last trying moments. In recent years I have often wondered if a distant photograph of people falling from the building had been too much to contemplate in 2001, how could those witnessing on a screen the suffering and death of their loved ones in real time ever deal with the pain? Would a proliferation of such imagery inevitably lead to some form of all-out war as the only way to revenge the suffering that had been shared? Could civilization right itself? The enormous freedom of expression and dissemination that we have been given in this era of camera-phones is certainly not a license to photograph and publish everything. But for those in a terrible situation, it may be a response, perhaps the only one, which makes some sense. And, as a result, the viewer from afar will not be spared the intimacies of extraordinary suffering, nor will he or she most likely feel that there is an adequate response to them. Read next: Why Violent News Images Matter This simultaneous viewing of horror inflicted on others may puncture one 2019s sense of equilibrium without providing a way to move forward. Such imagery may acknowledge symptoms but do little to explore and repair underlying systems that may be at least partly responsible for the tragedies. Professional journalists, whose job has been to mediate such events, have been largely circumvented by people reporting on their own lives, with results often perceived as more credible due to the raw and unfiltered quality of their documentation. This year 2019s sad, farcical campaign for national election, preoccupying mainstream media while resembling reality television, is hardly reassuring. Voices like that of Diamond Reynolds, or of the anonymous woman reading her anguished 12-page statement last month in a California court as her student-athlete attacker, judged guilty of three felony counts of sexual assault, is given a light, six-month sentence, have found their way into the center of a national conversation. The evidence of social injustice, made available at great personal cost by the individuals affected, now must be responded to with a similar sense of urgency and clarity. Otherwise, we are reduced to a stance of voyeurism, of the most intimate and appalling kind. Fred Ritchin is Dean of the School at the International Center of Photography.

   "input": "Amid growing controversy over whether it should be played at sports events, the national anthem has been dropped from the Olympic Invitational track and field meet at Madison Square Garden. The playing of 201cThe StarSpangled Banner 201d is not obligatory, since 201cits purpose and relevance to sports events has never been established, 201d Jesse Abratson, the meet director, said yesterday. The meet will be staged Feb. 16. A Garden official said it would be the first time that a sports event would be held at the world's most famous indoor arena without the anthem being played. The new Garden will be 5 years old next month, and has housed more than 500 athletic contests, from the roller derby to wrestling. It was traditional since World War II to play the anthem at the old Garden. The action on the anthem came two days after the Eastern Michigan track team had been disqualified for not standing during the playing of the anthem at the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, L. I., where the Knights of Columbus meet was held. Three members of the milerelay team, all blacks, went through stretching exercises during the traditional playing. Some fans hooted and cursed and, after a delay, Jim Foley, the meet referee, summoned the games committee to the floor and a decision was made to disqualify the team. However, the chairman of the Olympic Invitational, Edwin H. Mosler Jr., said yesterday that he decided as long ago as last month to do away with the playing of the anthem. 201cSomeone asked us where do we put the national anthem [in the program], 201d he said, 201cand we couldn't find a spot. 201cSure, the black factor crossed our minds. One doesn't relish incidents that disrupt an event. It entered into our decision, but it wasn't the key factor. 201d At most track meets the anthem is played before the mile race, which usually is the event with the most spectator interest. Generally, it is last on the program. 201cI don't believe in stopping the Show at a time when the milers are all keyed up to run, 201d said Abramson. He added it would make little sense to play 201cThe Star 2010Spangled Banner 201d at the ;beginning of the meet, 201cwhen only a handful of people show up. 201d It was apparent that fear of an incident by fans or players had been a major factor in the decision. 201cWhat happened at the Coliseum affirms the fact we made a proper decision, 201d said Abramson. 201cWho needs booing? Maybe it's out of time, out of place, But I don't think the anthem and the flag should become an issue. 201d What appears to be a rising adverse reaction to playing the anthem at public events apparently stems from dissent over the Vietnam war, racial conflicts and a loss of confidence in society's values. Observers at sports events have noticed a tendency for Mans and athletes to talk, or even sit, in protest while it is played and sung. Since the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, when Tommie Smith and John Carlos, sprinters, stood on the winners' podium and raised their fists in the Black Power salute, the playing of the anthem has stirred controversy. Jos 00e9 Feliciano, the rock singer, was criticized for the way he sang it in a 1968 World Series game at Detroit. He used a syncopated beat and the television network received hundreds of complaints. He also received praise for his rendition. Last June the owner of the Kansas City Royals' baseball team, Ewing Kauffman, tried to limit the playing of the anthem to Sunday and holiday games. The policy held for two games and 200 complaints poured in, 201calmost all expressing indignant and emotional opposition, 201d according to Kauffman. He said he had thought many fans did not care, but he quickly restored the anthem. In the United States the four dominant major sports leagues 2014baseball, basketball, football and hockey 2014play the anthem before games. Where Canadian teams are involved, the Canadian anthem, 201cO Canada, 201d usually is played, too. However, in Montreal, 201cThe Star 2010Spangled Banner 201d no longer is played before hockey games involving United States teams. 201cThere is a lot of sentiment against the Vietnamese war in our country, 201d a Montreal Canadiens' official explained, 201cand we have a lot of Americans who came here to escape the draft. We don't want any incidents. 201d Many college basketball teams now hold team meetings during the playing of the anthem to avoid incidents involving players who do not want to stand during the ceremony. Some colleges have dropped the anthem at home games. At the 1971 Holiday Festival basketball tournament at the Garden, the Louisville team remained in the locker room during the anthem, which preceded its game. The publicaddress announcer, in anger, refused to announce the Louisville line 2010up. In Europe crowds generally are well behaved during the playing of a national anthem, even though up to a dozen anthems might be played at an international event. Before the start of the 24 Hours of Le Mans Auto race, the national anthems of each country represented is played. In Switzerland, an international boxing match is preceded by the playing of the anthems of each fighter's country, the Swiss anthem and that of the referee's country. During the 1972 Olympics at Munich, Vince Matthews and Wayne Collett, United States runners, talked and stood at ease during 201cThe Star 2010Spangled Banner. 201d Later, both spoke of their displeasure with this country, saying the words and meaning of the anthem were not being fulfilled. Although the controversy surrounding the playing of the anthem at sports events has involved mostly black competitors, no national organization appears to be making a concerted effort against blacks' standing or appearing in front of fans during the anthem. In a recent directive to member groups of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the executive director, Roy Wilkins, said: 201cThere is no national anthem for Negroes. There is only one national anthem. The national anthem is for all Americans. 201d We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.

The Future Reef 2.0 project is helping to identify which parts of the reef are most vulnerable to ocean acidification change and has just been extended for another three years. CSIRO scientists have been running an advanced sensor system from a Rio Tinto vessel as part of the research, which also involves the Great Barrier Reef Foundation. CSIRO ocean carbon research scientist Dr Bronte Tilbrook said the research has found ocean chemistry remains positive for coral growth. Dr Tilbrook said it had also found there were strong seasonal changes, with the best coral growing conditions in summer. Conditions were also better in the outer regions of the reef and there was more coral growth in the northern parts, he said. Specifically, the project has been examining how the entire reef is responding to ocean acidification, bleaching and cyclones. The data is going to help us understand how the reef is growing and how it's responding to certain stresses , he told AAP. We need to get the big picture and that's the thing the ship is allowing us to do.  ",

Stephanie Joy Maher broke down in the dock as the judge described how her son , who was three when he was in the car the day she left Melbourne engineer Julian Paul for dead, would only see her in the confines of prison. The extended term of prison you face will have a disastrous effect on him , Victorian County Court Judge David Parsons said. But , he added, she could only blame herself. Maher,33, was jailed for 11 years with a non-parole period of eight and a half after a jury found her guilty of culpable driving causing death, failing to stop and failing to render assistance. Mr Paul,54, was riding home on the Nepean Highway in Brighton on November 26, 2013 when Maher's car struck his bike. His neck and back were broken and he died three weeks later when his life-support was turned off. Maher claims she did not know it was a person she hit, thinking it was a stick or a rock that shattered her windscreen. Numerous witnesses saw her swerving, driving erratically, and one saw Mr Paul illuminated by Maher's car headlights before she bumped into the rear of his bike. Maher, a former nurse, told a psychologist she does not understand why other motorists didn't call triple-zero, flash their lights or toot their horns at her. There is , it seems, a significant amount of self-pity ... but I see no real evidence of your accepting responsibility for the death of Mr Paul, Judge Parsons said. He recounted Maher's significant criminal history , which includes assault, drug possession and theft offences. After her nursing registration was suspended, she stole from a number of hospitals to support her drug habit. On one occasion she took a syringe containing pain-relief medication from a patient recovering from surgery. In my opinion your behaviour towards Julian Paul displayed the same moral turpitude as when you committed this crime , Judge Parsons said. He described her prospects for rehabilitation as limited and said she was likely to re-offend. Judge Parsons appeared to choke up as he recalled the emotional victim impact statement delivered by Mr Paul's wife , Janine, who said she felt like she had died, too. We can only grieve with her and hope her grief diminishes , Judge Parsons said.  ",

We'll be making further statements through the day on this. The investigation is at a crucial stage at this time and that's all I can say. Det. Insp. Hansen confirmed that a seized car did belong to Tiahleigh's foster father , and declined to identify any persons of interest in the case. It's possibly been one of the most difficult investigations that I've been involved in. There's a mountain of work that's gone on behind the scenes , he said. A $250 ,000 reward is on offer for information on her death. (AAP) Earlier today, Tiahleigh's foster father told media he had nothing to say about the car being seized. When asked why the blue Ford XR6 sedan was taken by police for forensic examination last week , he said speak to the Crime and Corruption Commission. Tiahleigh was reportedly last seen alive when she was dropped off at Marsden State High School on October 30 last year. Her remains were located on the banks of the Pimpama River on November 5. The seized car had since been sold , and the current owner is not linked to the investigation, police earlier advised. Investigators have also appealed for anyone who saw a car matching its description on Kerkin Road North near the Pimpama River last October to come forward. Detective Inspector Mark White said 20 investigators were working on the homicide case, which remains a top priority for police. The investigation's been going on for almost 11 months and the investigators involved are relentless in identifying those persons who are responsible , he said.

   "input": "The first thing to know about Castle of our Skins is that it 2019s a Roxbury-based concert and education series of classical music by black composers, past and present, and that it will kick off its fourth season on Saturday with 201cA Veil of Liquid Diamonds, 201d a program of works by the Ohio-based African-American composer Jeffrey Mumford. The next thing is where the series gets its unusual and evocative name. Ashleigh Gordon, a violist and the series 2019s cofounder and codirector, said during a recent phone conversation that it comes from the opening of a poem by Nikki Giovanni: 201cWe are all imprisoned in the castle of our skins. 201d The poem, Gordon explained, makes the point that 201cif this is who I am, I will learn to love it, to exalt it, to feel wholly comfortable and fully embrace my skin. And that kind of unabashed appreciation of who we are is what Castle of our Skins is trying to do. 201d The necessary prerequisite for appreciating this tradition of classical music by black composers, of course, is knowing that it even exists. That 2019s the first hurdle that Castle of our Skins seeks to overcome. 201cI want people to understand that it is diverse, there is this history and this culture, in this country and around the world, 201d Gordon said. 201cIt 2019s not just spirituals, it 2019s not just jazz 2014 nothing wrong with those genres, but there is a world out there and it 2019s already quite rich and fertile. You just have to be exposed to it. 201d That 2019s no easy feat. When Gordon and her cofounder, composer Anthony Green, first talked about creating a platform to change that, 201cwe could list on maybe one hand, between us, black composers that we knew of. 201d Their solution was research, and lots of it. Gordon spent a week at the Center for Black Music Research in Chicago and came up with stacks of music, much of it largely unknown. Castle of our Skins repertoire now stretches from composers born in the 19th century such as William Grant Still and Florence Price to current voices such as Jessie Montgomery and Renee Baker. One especially valuable discovery was the Guadalupe-born Chevalier de Saint-Georges, one of the first composers of African ancestry. (He was sometimes referred to as 201cthe black Mozart. 201d) He wrote a number of string quartets, some of which are sprinkled throughout the group 2019s concerts this season. Castle 2019s new season is a busy one. In addition to Saturday 2019s concert, there will be an 201cedu-tainment 201d concert of string quartets in the courtyard of the Boston Public Library that 2019s part of ArtWeek Boston (Oct. 1); a contribution to Franklin Park Art Grove called 201cA House of My Own, 201d exploring the concept of home through a black lens (also Oct. 1); a residency at Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania (Nov. 13-15); the premiere of three pieces written in response to the group 2019s call for works for strings inspired by black visual art (March 24); an ambitious collaboration with Roxbury-based artist Daniel Callahan (April 29); and a performance in the group 2019s annual residency at the Museum of African American History (June 8). 201cIt 2019s exciting and also incredibly overwhelming at the same time, 201d Gordon acknowledged. 201cBut it really feeds itself, a kind of energy that you give out and you receive at these events. 201d As for Saturday 2019s concert, it is the first dedicated to a single composer and will feature Gordon 2019s string trio, Sound Energy. She met Mumford in the early 2000s, when she was a student at Baldwin Wallace University and he taught at Oberlin College.

Moscow warned that the comments could harm the US-Russia brokered ceasefire in Syria, as Boris Johnson visited a refugee camp in Turkey, near the Syrian border. The Foreign Secretary's visit to the camp around 161km from Aleppo in Syria comes after angry exchanges at the United Nations over the latest offensive by the Russia-backed regime to take the beleaguered city. Russia was accused by Britain and the US of barbarity and helping Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime unleash a new hell on the city but Moscow has hit back. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia considers the tone of the criticism unacceptable and insisted such rhetoric is capable of causing serious harm to the resolution process in Syria. Peskov told reporters that Russia was concerned that terrorists were using the ceasefire to regroup , to replenish their arsenals and for obvious preparations to carry out attacks. Meanwhile , the Syrian regime said the ceasefire is still viable and said it was willing to take part in a unity government but also claimed the West was supporting terrorists in the country. Their comments come after British ambassador Matthew Rycroft joined his US and French counterparts in walking out of an emergency session of the UN Security Council on Sunday in a show of anger. The meeting came after Johnson warned that Moscow would be guilty of committing war crimes if its warplanes were deliberating striking civilian targets. Rycroft told the security council meeting in New York that it was difficult to deny that Assad's regime and its Russian allies were engaged in committing war crimes. After five years of conflict , you might think that the regime has had its fill of barbarity - that its sick bloodlust against its own people has finally run its course, he said. But this weekend , the regime and Russia have instead plunged to new depths and unleashed a new hell on Aleppo. The UN special envoy on Syria , Staffan de Mistura, said the offensive to take the city had unleashed unprecedented military violence on its inhabitants , killing at least 213 civilians, many of them women and children. He said there had been reports of the use of bunker-busting bombs and incendiary weapons which created fireballs of such intensity that they light up the pitch darkness in Aleppo as if it were daylight. Earlier , Johnson accused Russian president Vladimir Putin of protracting and called for an investigation into whether Russian forces were committing war crimes. Putin's regime is not only as it were handing Assad the revolver , he is in some instances firing the revolver himself, he said.  ",

Mr Adams,64, pleaded not guilty to allegations he strangled nurse Mary Wallace,33, in the NSW Supreme Court on this afternoon. Crown prosecutor Mark Hobart SC alleged Mr Adams had choked Ms Wallace after they met during a night of drinking at the Alpine Inn in Crow 2019s Nest on September 24, 1983. During the act , the accused placed his hands around (the victim 2019s) throat and strangled her until she almost became unconscious, Mr Hobart told the court. Mr Hobart said Ms Wallace accepted a lift from Mr Adams in the early hours of the morning after he claimed he was a police officer. Mr Adams told police he'd tried to have consensual sex with her in his car before falling asleep and waking to find her gone. He was charged with Ms Wallace 2019s murder in 2013 after forensic technology matched two hairs found in his boot to the victim 2019s DNA profile. Defence barrister Peter Lange said Mr Adams denied trying to choke the victim , and some of the evidence, including the DNA evidence, would be disputed. Ms Wallace 2019s body has never been found. Mr Hobart also alleged Mr Adams had raped three other women in the 1970s, and each time had taken his victim in a choke-hold 201cfor sexual gratification 201d. His trial for a 1975 rape was abandoned after the victim fled Sydney saying she was in fear of her life, Mr Hobart said. Mr Adams was also convicted of the May 1976 rape of a woman he met at a Mosman sailing club. After she rejected his advances, Mr Adams allegedly took her by the throat and threatened to choke her, to finish her off and throw her into the water where she would tell no tales , Mr Hobart said. I've done a terrible thing. Take me to the police station , Mr Adams allegedly told his victim afterwards. Mr Hobart said it was after the second rape charge that Mr Adams told the investigating detective , I need psychiatric help. I must be mad to do these things. He was sentenced to six years' jail but only served two. Adams met the third woman at a North Sydney bar in 1978 and raped her in his car while squeezing her throat , before taking her to a house and having sex with her twice more, a court heard.  ",

Newly-released documents show the baseball team filed a five-page comment letter in October with city officials complaining that Belkin 2019s proposed 340-foot tower, two blocks away at Charlesgate and Ipswich Street, would loom too closely over its beloved stadium and 201csignificantly transform the iconic views of the city skyline that fans now enjoy. 201d 201cWe have strong concerns that this proposed project would create an unacceptably tall and impactful 29-story building in very close proximity to Fenway Park, and which might have significant negative impacts on the surrounding neighborhood as well as our historic ballpark itself, 201d wrote David Friedman, the team 2019s senior vice president for legal and government affairs, in a letter to the Boston Planning & Development Agency. The Red Sox 2019 principal owner, John Henry, also owns the Boston Globe. The team had no comment. The Red Sox included in its comments an image they said came from Belkin 2019s development team showing the new tower jutting above the park just beyond the right field stands. Belkin 2019s formal submission to the BPDA does not include any images showing views of the tower from Fenway. Other groups, including the Fenway Civic Association and Boston Preservation Alliance, have also raised concerns about the tower, chiefly over the shadows it may cast on nearby parks and 201cuncomfortable 201d winds it would generate on Ipswich Street. The tower has some support, too, including from the Fenway Alliance, an umbrella group for cultural and educational institutions in the neighborhood, and Fenway Studios, an artists 2019 housing development that Belkin 2019s company, Trans National Properties, is in talks with to help fund renovations. Justin Krebs, who is spearheading the project for Belkin, said his team will modify the building design to address wind and shadow concerns. But he also noted its height is necessary to build enough units to fund promised improvements to Ipswich Street and pathways along the Muddy River, and to create more affordable housing in the neighborhood. 201cWe 2019re open to a dialogue, 201d Krebs said. 201cBut we haven 2019t heard a reason why we should reduce the height. We 2019re sensitive to how that impacts our ability to deliver all of the other benefits that seem to be widely embraced by the community. 201d But Krebs noted the tower would not cast shadows onto Fenway Park itself. Still, the team, in its letter, calls for more thorough study, and if necessary a shorter building. The BPDA has been holding public and community meetings on the project in recent weeks. Final approval is still at least a few months away. In an e-mailed statement, BPDA director Brian Golden said his agency is 201ceager to see redevelopment at the site that is appropriate for the Fenway neighborhood. 201d  ",

This was the degree to which the men of the Morro Castle - the most cowardly in the history of the sea , snarled a disgusted Coast Guardsman - had abandoned their paying customers to the flaming horror 8 miles out. Homebound to New York after a merry Havana holiday , the luxurious Ward Line pleasure ship had been struck down in the darkness by a phantom stranger. Capt. Robert Willmott had suddenly died, hale one minute and agonizingly sick the next. Shortly after that, fast-spreading fires had begun raging from stem to stern. Then two great explosions had lit up the night, and all hands had taken to the boats and deserted, leaving the passengers to burn to cinders in the furnace belowdecks or hurl themselves, screaming, into the ocean. And the elegant Morro Castle had drifted on, a floating crematory. In their cabins, nothing would be found of the trapped dead but their dentures. By daybreak Sunday the 9th of September 1934, the great vacation liner was beached at Asbury Park, a charred and smoldering hulk 200 feet off the boardwalk, a thrilling spectacle for hundreds of thousands of gogglers. In New York City, the Federal Bureau of Navigation immediately convened hearings into what already was shaping up as one of the world's eeriest maritime mysteries. This was no act-of-God lightning strike, as Ward Line officials had at once sought to suggest. No, this was pure evil. This was monstrousness beyond imagination. Wholesale murder! bellowed the Daily News. HAVANA WAS casinos and racetracks and lilting tropical nights , once a playground for only the wealthier of American sports, more recently become an affordable package destination for thousands of middle-class tourists eagerly courted by the cruise lines. Havana was also soldiers and rebels and shooting in the streets - regularly roiled by insurrectionists even in the best of times, now in particular turmoil ever since the Army had driven butcher Gerardo Machado out of the Cuban presidency - but that only added to the exotic intrigue of the place. Everyone wanted a Havana holiday. At the Ward Line pier at the foot of Wall St. on Sunday afternoon, even as weeping families gathered upstairs for any shred of news of their missing loved ones, downstairs there were gay bon voyage parties for those boarding the Iroquois. There were newlyweds. There was flying rice. In Havana, these travelers would be met by the same striking dockworkers who had sent off the Morro Castle a few days before. Several longshoremen had been killed in recent rioting, scores of citizens and soldiers injured, and it was Cuba's Maritime Labor Union that fast became the focus of the Morro Castle investigation as Navigation Bureau Assistant Chief Dickerson Hoover - brother of the Justice Department's J. Edgar Hoover - opened his hearings. Had these radicals actually planted incendiaries aboard the liner and poisoned its captain to teach a frightful lesson to the Ward Line? That was certainly what first appearances suggested. In Havana, Cuban police flatly declared the Morro Castle disaster an act of sabotage and rounded up mobs of Reds. Threats were made against the Pan-American Airways seaplane terminal. Murder plots against U.S. Ambassador Jefferson Caffery were uncovered. Growled The News: If this is a sample of the return we can expect from a faction in Cuba for the decency and open-handedness with which the Roosevelt administration has treated Cuba , then we ought to take reprisals. ... If any faction of Cubans did this thing, it is up to us to give them a punishment they will never forget. BUT THE affair would not be that simple. Things became only murkier as Hoover's probe proceeded. In Cuba , authorities now theorized that the plot against the Morro Castle had been hatched in New York; the city had, of course, been a hotbed of Cuban exile politics for nearly 40 years; it was William Randolph Hearst's newspaper that had, after all, ignited the Spanish-American War. At the same time, U.S. Attorney Martin Conboy charged in open court that Ward Line officials were inexplicably blocking the federal investigation at every turn. Soon, these officials were refusing to make any comment at all, as evidence mounted that their flagship had regularly ferried arms from New York to Havana. The Morro Castle probe was obviously going to be a long and drawn-out business, full of twists and turns and incomprehensibilities. Perhaps there would never be solution and closure. BLACKENED AND dead, the ship sat immovably in 12 feet of water, nose pointed at New York as tugboats strained helplessly. There was no moving the corpse. Apparently it would be a beachfront attraction for a long time to come. In much the same way that, two years earlier, families had happily motored out to New Jersey's Sourland Mountains for a Sunday picnic at the spot where the Lindbergh baby was found, throngs now made it their custom to descend on Asbury Park for a day with the Morro Castle. Boardwalk business boomed. The convention center started charging 25 cents a head for a vantage balcony view.  ",

Apparently the one city filthy enough to stand in for old-school New York is (the envelope , please) ... San Fran 00c2 00adcisco!

Indeed the casting couch is still stitched into the fabric of the not-so-glamorous industry, models and industry experts told this column in a series of interviews. Certain social settings invite abuse more than others. 201cWhen a girl is left alone with one person, it makes it easier for this to happen, 201d Jackie Miranne, a former 201cProject Runway 201d model, and the host of the 201cAmerica 2019s Next Top Model Aftershow 201d said. 201cCastings are always safest when they take place in a more professional setting, such as the offices of a magazine or casting company. 201d Unfortunately castings, where a model is chosen for a job, aren 2019t always held in traditional offices or audition rooms. In her early days, prominent petite model Isobella Jade made the mistake of going to meet with a so-called agent named Gianni in his apartment, and Gianni asked to see her body. 201cI don 2019t know what came over me but I even undressed to my bra and panties. He kept saying, 2018you have such a hot little body. 2019 It was an innocent compliment and I took it, but then he kept trying to tickle me, 201d said Jade, who has since written about her life in the modeling memoir 201cAlmost 5 20194. 201d 201cThere were times during my early years pursuing modeling when I was asked to bend or pose in a certain suggestive way when the shoot didn 2019t call for that to happen. There were times I was told if I gave the photographer 2018more attention, 2019 my photos would be sent to an editor at a magazine. 201d Model Amy Weber has no shortage of scary tales to tell. 201c[A photographer] drove me out to the middle of nowhere and told me to lie down in the high grass. I was wearing a bikini and he kept telling me to get into these super provocative poses and at one point said, 2018open your legs like a flower, 2019 201d she said. 201cI was so creeped out that I ran out and walked almost 15 miles to get to a place to grab a taxi. 201d And even legitimate meetings can involve an excessive amount of flash flashing. 201cSometimes it is easy and you go in, one at a time, and show your book, or try on garments and you are out of there. But sometimes it is a major cattle call, and they will at times ask you to be ready to go either in your bathing suit or bra and panty, 201d Weber continued. 201cSo you are literally standing there with a hundred other girls wearing practically nothing, trying not to compare your boobs to the girl on your right. Horrible. 201d 201cThere a few big names in the fashion industry that are notorious for 2018sampling 2019 the models before they took the job. Basically, it comes down to a choice of whether you are willing to throw your principles overboard to accelerate your career, 201d said former model Ariane Sommer. 201cIt becomes more problematic, however, if the model in question is extremely young and impressionable. These girls often don 2019t know how to stand up for themselves and are like a deer in the headlights. 201d Indeed models are entering the profession at younger and younger ages. This year, a 10-year-old girl posed for French Vogue, all dressed up and draped cross a couch. In 2007 a 12-year-old was named the Face of Gold Coast Fashion Week in Australia. Prada recently used a bevy of beauties as young as 13 for a provocative ad campaign. Bloch vividly remembers being on a shoot with Liv Tyler, who was a mere 14 or 15 years old at the time, where the alcohol was flowing. 201cThere was lots of guys around, laughing and talking dirty, lots of beer and smoking. Everybody totally just forgot Liv was just a child, 201d he said. 201cShe was just so mature and just rolled with it. It is very easy to forget a lot of these girls are so so young. 201d Model Fernanda Romero, who stars in the new Mango fashion ad campaign, said in a lot of cases, there is nobody guiding these very na 00efve, desperate-to-succeed models through the ins and outs of a very grown-up industry. 201cThere is no one there to help, 201d she said. 201cOnly your agents can help at times. But they have got so many girls that you have to be smart and wise, and know very well who you hang around According to Romero, the ones to look out for are the men behind the cameras. 201cThere are some predators for sure, I wouldn 2019t say stylists or agents, it is more the photographers, 201d she said. 201cOf course they aren 2019t all bad; there are some amazing professionals out there. 201d Miranne also said that it 2019s not uncommon for 201ccreepy designers or photographers 201d to ask models to do inappropriate things like pose nude or undress for a video camera, and she often feels sick to her stomach when other girls share their horror stories. But the industry isn 2019t all evil. 201cYou can find bad people who will take advantage of weaker people in any kind of industry, so of course there are some in the fashion business, 201d Sommer continued. 201cI don 2019t think it would fair to say that it is commonplace for young models to be taken advantage of, but there is certainly a risk. 201d  ",

There are lots of other juicy tax benefits that are slated to disappear at the end of 2011, but read carefully, because some are subject to income testing. A little planning can go a long way , according to Michael Goodman , CPA PFS, CFP and President of Wealthstream Advisors. He advises acceleration of deductions this tax year if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket next year. 7 deductions due to expire in 2011 1) Higher education expenses: Taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes (AGI's) of up to $65,000 for singles and $130,000 for couples can claim $4,000 of deductions for college tuition and fees. (IRS Publication 970) 2) Mortgage insurance deduction: Borrowers with AGI's up to $100,000 may be able to treat qualified mortgage insurance as home mortgage interest, which means that 100 percent of 2011 premiums may be deductible. The insurance contract had to be issued after 2006 and deductions are phased out in 10 percent increments for homeowners with AGI's between $100,001 and $109,000. (IRS Publication 936) 3) State sales-tax deduction: If you itemize your taxes, you can choose to take an itemized deduction for state sales taxes instead of state and local income taxes. This is a no-brainer for residents of states without income taxes, such as Texas and Nevada. But it might also work for people in areas with low state-income taxes that made a large purchase during the year such as a car or an engagement ring. (IRS sales tax calculator) 4) Energy efficiency upgrades: Here's where going green can save you green. If you make energy efficiency improvements to your home before the end of the year, you may be eligible for a tax credit of 10 percent for the cost, up to a maximum of $500. Approved improvements include new windows, insulation, high efficiency furnaces, water heaters and air conditioning, among many. Be sure to keep your receipts and manufacturer certification. (Energy Star items that qualify for the tax deduction) 5) IRA charitable donation: Donors over age 70 1 2 can contribute up to $100,000 of traditional IRA assets directly to one or more qualified charities (but not a donor-advised fund). While there's no tax deduction, the gift is excluded from income, and can count as part or all of the required minimum distribution. The charity must be qualified as publicly supported (no private foundations or donor-advised funds), and the distribution must go directly from your IRA to the charity without going to you first. The timing of this could be perfect if you haven't yet taken your required minimum distribution for 2011; if you don't need the money; or if you don't itemize. (IRS Publication 590) 6) Enhanced adoption credits: As part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (March 2010), the Adoption Tax Credit was extended one year until Dec. 31,2011, the amount of credit was increased to $13,360 and it was made refundable, meaning that families can benefit even if they have less than $13,360 of federal income tax liability. If adoption expenses have been paid for by an employer, you may qualify to exclude up to $13,360 from income. The credit is subject to income phaseouts from $185,210 to $225,210 in AGI. (IRS Topic 607) 7) Classroom deduction for teachers: K-12 educators who work at least 900 hours during the school year can claim an above-the-line deduction of up to $250 ($500 if married filing joint and both spouses are educators, but not more than $250 each) of any unreimbursed expenses (books, supplies, computer equipment (including related software and services), other equipment, and supplementary materials) used in the classroom. (IRS Topic 458) 9 More year-end tax tips (with no expiration, except the calendar) 1) Mail your checks for deductible purchases: Procrastinator alert! If you're the type of person who waits until the last minute for everything, take note: To qualify for write-offs of charitable contributions and business expenses, your payments must be postmarked by midnight Dec. 31. The IRS says just writing December 31 on the check does not automatically qualify you for a deduction; and pledges aren't deductible until paid. Donations made with a credit card are deductible as of the date the account is charged. 2) Give appreciated stock or fund shares to charity: Get in the holiday spirit , with the help of Uncle Sam. One way to lower your tax bill in April is to donate appreciated securities, like stocks, bonds or mutual funds, to a charity. You'll write off the current market value (not just what you paid for them) and escape taxes on the accumulated gains. Since charities don't have to pay capital gains on the gift, they get the full value of your generosity. Goodman says donor-advised funds are a great solution for quick year-end planning. If you know you want the deduction but can't make the decision as to which charity you want to use , the DAF allows you to capture the deduction now and decide on the charity later. 3) Take advantage of low capital gains rates: If you're in the 10 or 15 percent bracket -- taxable income below $67 ,900 for married couples and $33,950 for singles -- profits on long-term capital gains (or ones owned more than 12 months) won't be taxed at all in 2011 and 2012. That's right: Your capital gains tax rate will be ZERO percent. It might make sense to sell taxable assets at gains in the next two years, because most experts believe that rates will rise in the future. That goes for high earners, because the current top rate is at a historic low of 15 percent. Given that a new 3.8 percent tax on net investment income is set to take effect in 2013 for joint filers with AGI's of $250,000 or more (or $200, 000 for single filers) it makes sense to consider locking in gains at this year's lower rate. Goodman warns that the portion of the capital gain that puts you over the taxable income threshold will be taxed at the higher cap gains rate. 4) Sell losers: If you have investment losses in a taxable account , now is the time to use those losers to your advantage. You can sell losing positions to offset gains that you have taken previously in the year, to minimize your tax hit. If you have more losses than gains, you can deduct up to $3,000 of losses against ordinary income. If you have more than $3,000 of losses, you can carry over that amount to future years. 5) Avoid getting soaked by a wash sale: If you are starting to clean up your non-retirement accounts to take losses, don't get soaked by the Wash Sale rule. The IRS won't let you deduct a loss if you buy a substantially identical investment within 30 days , what's known as a wash sale. To avoid the wash sale, wait 31 days and repurchase the stock or fund you sold, or replace the security with something that is close, but not the same as the one you sold...hopefully something cheaper, like an index fund. (IRS Publication 550) 6) Fully fund your college savings 529 plan: The average public university now charges over $8,200 for tuition and fees -- a massive 8.3 percent increase from last year -- so now's the time to get a leg up on your education savings with a 529 plan. Money saved in these programs grows tax-free and withdrawals used to pay for college sidestep taxes, too. You can invest up to $13,000 in 2011 without incurring a federal gift tax and many states offer state tax deductions for the contributions. (529 Plan information) 7) Use your flex account or lose it: Some employers require employees with flexible spending accounts (pretax dollars that pay out-of-pocket medical and childcare expenses) to forfeit contributions that go unused by Dec. 31. If you have an FSA, check your company's rules. If you have cash sitting in the account and your deadline is year-end, spend it to avoid leaving money on the table. 8) Retirement withdrawals: According to Fidelity Investments, two-thirds of all IRA holders haven't yet taken their required payouts (required minimum distributions or MRD), which must be withdrawn by Dec. 31. There is one exception: Taxpayers taking their first required payout may do so by April 1, 2012. The penalty on not taking your required minimum distribution is steep -- 50 percent on the shortfall. (IRS FAQs about MRDs) 9) Project your income: If you're self-employed, estimate your income for 2011 and 2012. If your tax bracket could rise next year, delay making tax-deductible business purchases until January, when the write-offs will become more valuable. If you think you'll bring in less money in 2012, do exactly the reverse.  ",

The tangled wreckage of a vehicle was seen near the Norwegian government building that was targeted in the blast, officials said. It was not clear if the car was a bomb vehicle or near the site of a blast. At least one explosion was the result of a massive vehicle bomb, U.S. government sources on the scene said. Hours after the blasts, a gunman opened fire at a youth meeting on an island outside of Oslo, killing at least 80. One man was arrested in connection to both attacks. Norwegian Minister of Justice Knut Storberget said the man in custody was Norwegian but his motives are unclear at this time. TV2, Norway's largest broadcaster, later identified the suspect as Anders Behring Breivik,32, describing him as a member of right-wing extremist groups in eastern Norway. Norwegian police would not confirm the identity of the suspect. READ: Gunman Opens Fire at Norwegian Youth Camp Norway's prime minister , Jens Stoltenberg, who has an office in a building hit by the blast, was uninjured and said in a statement the blast was severe and all available resources were being put into the rescue effort. President Obama said the incident was a reminder that the entire international community has a stake in preventing this kind of terror from occurring. WATCH: Our Hearts Go Out to the People of Norway , Obama Says Pictures, posted on Twitter, show several buildings with windows blown out. Multiple tweets described people bleeding in the streets. It felt very big. It shook the whole building , Norwegian government official Anders Lande said of one explosion. There was lots of glass. As I was evacuated , I saw several people injured. U.S. ambassador to Norway , Barry White, said the United States condemns these despicable acts of terrorism. The American ambassador said the attack will serve as a kind of wake-up call to Norwegians who may have thought they were safe from terrorism. White said all US embassy staff were safe and accounted for.

   "input": "This afternoon the Lords have to decide whether to defy the Commons and vote to remove the glorification clause from the terrorism bill for a second time. Artists - particularly in the arts which involve representation - will be hoping they'll do so. Partly because of Rowan Atkinson's intervention, the religious hatred bill was seen as the most obvious threat to artistic expression. But the glorification clause is perhaps even more dangerous. Subject to considerable pressure, Charles Clarke amended his original proposals, and incorporated glorification within the offence of indirectly encouraging terrorism. Under the new clause a laudatory speech, play or pamphlet about the ANC, the Irgun or the Easter Rising would only fall within the net if the speaker intended his or her audience to be encouraged to emulate it in existing circumstances. It is this clause which the Lords removed, substituting one which defined indirect encouragement in pretty much the same terms as glorification. What it didn't have was the word glorify. The difference between the Commons and the Lords is not about encouragement of terrorism , which is clearly criminalised. It's about the expression of an opinion. Where the representational arts specifically get into trouble is in the only allowable defence, which in both versions is for the accused to show that the glorification or encouragement neither expressed his views nor had his endorsement. When the opinion is represented, how do you know? The conundrum has been confronted before. The problem for theatre companies with the prohibition of the promotion of homosexuality by local authorities (section 28) was defining promotion. By having lesbian protagonists , do Lillian Hellman's The Children's Hour, or Frank Marcus's The Killing of Sister George, promote their sexuality? Similarly , does a laudatory biography, documentary drama or eulogy endorse the terrorist actions of Nelson Mandela or Gerry Adams in a way that might encourage disenfranchised minorities to take up arms , as they did? Juries will face these questions when the distinction between portrayal and promotion, expression and endorsement, representation and its object is subject to a challenge which goes way beyond the Danish cartoons. As we speak, Christian Voice is picketing the tour of Jerry Springer: The Opera, on the grounds that a dramatisation of a TV presenter's nightmare is a literal representation of Jesus Christ. Last week, actors playing Guant 00e1namo inmates were interrogated under terror laws at Luton airport. The failure of public institutions to distinguish between representation and reality is not without precedent. The newspapers which excoriated Sikhs and Muslims for challenging free speech have campaigned vigorously for the suppression of plays, paintings and even books which represent or refer to Myra Hindley, Mary Bell or James Bulger's killers, on the grounds that representation is an endorsement of their crimes. In the same way, the Daily Mail criticised a proposed TV dramadocumentary about the IRA on the grounds that dramatisation almost inevitably makes the audience see things from the central character's point of view. Once again , the distinction between representation, description and promotion becomes dangerously fuzzy. John Adams's The Death of Klinghoffer has been attacked for representing the views of terrorist hijackers. Will librettist Dic Edwards face prosecution for his opera Manifest Destiny, whose central character is a Palestinian woman tempted to become a suicide bomber? We cannot rely on the presumption that the principles of free speech are as hard-wired into our culture as we might like to. The cartoon controversy is framed as the rational, enlightened west versus backward Islam. In fact, under theatre censorship laws that were not abolished until 1968, British playwrights couldn't show two men in bed together, mention venereal disease, criticise the royal family, insult friendly foreign powers, or represent God. The Sheffield Crucible's revival of Howard Brenton's The Romans in Britain reminds us that, as recently as 1980, a theatre director was prosecuted for pimping, on the grounds that there was no difference between actors simulating sex on stage and a couple having sex in the street. In fact, the difference goes to the core of how human beings learn, act and live. When Home Office minister Fiona Mactaggart says that the rights of artists have to be set against the rights of communities to be secure and safe, she trivialises and marginalises activities that are central to how we are. By enabling people to imagine what it is like to see the world through other eyes, artistic representation develops capacities without which we cannot live together in societies at all. To promote that complex but vital idea requires, first, levelling the playing field by repealing the blasphemy laws. It requires an understanding of why Muslims and Sikhs get angry, and an acknowledgement that they are not the only religions involved in these controversies. But it also requires the House of Lords to stick to its guns today. 00b7 David Edgar is a playwright; a longer version of this article will appear in the next edition of NCA News, the journal of the National Campaign for the Arts  ",

   "input": "A 21-year-old Bay Area man is suing 49ers linebacker Aldon Smith and former 49ers tight end Delanie Walker, saying he was shot twice in the leg when he was caught in the crossfire of a drunken gunfight at Smith's home that included both football players. The lawsuit , filed Tuesday in Santa Clara County Superior Court by Ronndale Esporlas, seeks unspecified damages from Smith,23, and Walker, 29. Walker left the 49ers after last season and signed with the Tennessee Titans. The suit stems from a party that Smith threw on June 29,2012, at his home on Higuera Highland Lane in the foothills east of San Jose. More than 100 people showed up, and by the time the bash ended early the next morning, Smith had been stabbed and two people had been shot, authorities said. Smith, whose alleged attacker faces assault charges, said he knew the lawsuit was coming. Things happen , he said Wednesday at 49ers headquarters. You've just got to focus on the things that you do. I'm focused on playing against Green Bay , and we'll see how it goes. Walker said he was shocked by the lawsuit and complained his name was being put through the mud , according to the Tennessean newspaper in Nashville. An attorney for Esporlas said in the lawsuit that Smith and Walker charged $10 for admission to the party , plus $5 per drink. The football players themselves drank heavily, the suit said. At one point, in an effort to end the raucous event, Smith, Walker and others appeared on the balcony of the house , brandished handguns, and began shooting in the air, attorney David Kleczek wrote. He said Walker then moved to the driveway , where he began firing a handgun in the air and toward others attending the party. That's when a group of people near the street returned fire , the suit said, with Esporlas and a friend caught in the crossfire between the two groups of people firing gunshots at each other. According to Kleczek , Esporlas suffered permanent injuries to his leg. He said the players had fired handguns on the property on several other occasions before the party. Neither Smith nor Walker has been accused of crimes. But Santa Clara County prosecutors charged a man from San Jose with assault with a deadly weapon for allegedly stabbing Smith at the party in a gang-related attack. The charges against Steven Barba ,27, were filed in June but had never been reported publicly. A second defendant, 20-year-old Christopher Sanchez of San Jose, is charged with assault with a firearm for allegedly shooting 31-year-old Oladapo Ashaolu at the party. Attorneys for Barba and Sanchez, who are also charged with actively participating in a street gang, did not return telephone messages. Reached at his San Jose home, Ashaolu declined to comment. A judge has sealed affidavits describing the case at the request of the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office, which asserted that such disclosures would inhibit the further investigation of possible co-conspirators. Trent Baalke , the 49ers' general manager, released a statement Wednesday saying the team had been aware of this matter concerning Aldon Smith for some time. We will continue to monitor the situation closely , but will have no further comment at this time, as this is an ongoing legal matter. A spokesman for the Titans said the team was aware of the situation but would have no comment. Demian Bulwa is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

   "input": "Like most of his teammates, 49ers outside linebacker Dan Skuta has a laminated sheet of paper hanging near the top of his locker that reminds him of his past. Along with a pre-NFL photo, the paper details where Skuta ranked among his peers when he was a senior at Carman-Ainsworth High in Flint, Mich. Skuta was un- ranked nationally, was not ranked among the top prospects in his state and was a zero-star recruit. On Tuesday, a reporter glanced at Skuta's sheet and noted the scouting gurus weren't overly impressed. They didn't know anything about me , Skuta said. They still don't , probably. Skuta ,27, who was ignored by Division I colleges and not drafted by an NFL team, finally will step into the spotlight Thursday night when the 49ers visit the Rams. Skuta will start in place of All-Pro Aldon Smith, who reportedly entered a treatment facility Tuesday for a substance-abuse problem and will be away from the team indefinitely. That leaves some big cleats for Skuta to fill after he has been known primarily for his work on special teams since he entered the league as an undrafted free agent from Division II Grand Valley State in 2009. In his first four seasons with the Bengals, he started four games at inside linebacker, the last in 2011. After signing with the 49ers in March, he was moved to outside linebacker, where he has played six defensive snaps in the season's first three games. I'm happy I have the opportunity to play , Skuta said , and now I just have to make the most of it. I feel like (if) you start getting happy about something , that's when you start playing bad anyway. I'm just going to see it as an opportunity and play hard. Replacing Smith , who had a franchise-record 19.5 sacks last season, won't be a solo job. It's likely that Skuta will play in San Francisco's base defense and rookie Corey Lemonier, a third-round pick, will take the field in its nickel package. Neither Skuta nor Lemonier (seven snaps) has played much in the regular season, but both had a strong preseason. Skuta shared team-high honors with three sacks and Lemonier had two. Our team , GM, the coaches, the owners, they put a good team together, put up good starters, put up good backups, cornerback Carlos Rogers said. So that next person's got to come in and play to the level of him or better than him. It's hard to say that , being how good Aldon is, one of the best defensive players in the league, but we've got to pick up the slack and rally around the person who's his backup. Smith worked well in tandem with All-Pro defensive tackle Justin Smith , and they routinely caved in offensive lines with their stunts. Skuta has been taking notes and hopes to play off Justin Smith as well. I've always paid attention to how they played together , Skuta said. They did a great job in there together with communication and all their different stunts. If we get that opportunity , I'd like to do that stuff, too. I think I would fit in and do the same type of thing. Of course , Skuta realizes few expect him to approximate Smith on Thursday night. Not that being underestimated is anything new. Skuta has beaten long odds to reach this point, and admits to carrying a sizable chip on his shoulder every step of the way. Absolutely , Skuta said of his background. I'm going to be thinking about that my whole life beyond football. That's always going to be with me. Nothing's ever going to come easy , and I'm just going to play through it and do the best job I can. Eric Branch is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

   "input": "Even before he lost his sight, Sargy Mann was obsessed with ways of seeing. As a young painter he was tutored by singular realists 2013 Frank Auerbach, Euan Uglow 2013 who insisted that an individual artist must be exactly true to what he saw. For much of his working life Mann taught students at Camberwell School of Art all he knew about representing light and colour on canvas, with particular reference to Bonnard and Matisse, and he put all of that complex understanding into practice in his own, often gloriously sun-drenched landscapes and interiors. Like all painters, he suggests, he felt he knew instinctively what science was then in the process of discovering: that the eye was an entirely passive collector of visual stimuli, and that seeing was a learned activity that went on in different , discrete parts of the brain 2013 the imaginative piecework of collating form, and colour, and light into an understandable vision of the world, one you constantly made up as you went along. Before Sargy Mann married he lived for eight years as the house guest of his friends Kingsley Amis and his second wife, Elizabeth Jane Howard, in their Georgian home, Lemmons, in Hertfordshire. His habit was to go out into the garden and country and paint whenever he could. In 1972 the Amises and Mann were joined by the poet laureate Cecil Day-Lewis, dying from cancer, and his family. Daniel Day-Lewis, then a child and now a passionate collector of Mann's painting, recalls him at that time with a mixture of intrigue and delight, a welcome life force: I remember well Sargy's vigour and sense of purpose as he set out for a day of painting. Box and boards , a long stride, eyes aglitter. And I looked forward to the fisherman's return, which was never empty-handed 2026 Mann's distinctive vision , born of generously attentive looking, began to be tinged that same year by the growth of cataracts in both of his eyes. He was only 36 and for months went undiagnosed. The change in his sight he greeted with artistic curiosity: my world had become greyer and hotter , he recalls. I was a human spectroscope such that I could see that a sodium streetlamp was monochrome because it only had an orange halo whereas a car tail light of the same colour had a spectral halo 2026 He'd read about Monet's cataract operations before he had his own and what he was most interested to discover was whether he had colourless cataracts or the yellowy-brown ones that had progressively informed the changing palette of the Impressionist at Giverny. Would he , like Monet, see the world saturated in blue again after the operation? To his joy he did, and his painting for a while reflected this new cobalt dazzle. Mann's eye problems were only just beginning, however. By the time he gave up teaching in 1988, and began working full time as a painter 2013 by now with a wife, his former student Frances Carey and their young family to support in south London 2013 retinal detachments and corneal ulcerations had diminished his detailed sight to almost nothing. He pieced together bits of the world with his one pretty hopeless eye by looking through a specially modified telescope, and when he went painting often took with him a white stick. On one occasion he heard his son's friend suggest that your dad is probably the best blind painter in Peckham. The phrase became the title of a recent memoir that details a heroically good-humoured struggle against the dying of the light , one that continues day by day. Mann is recalling some of this history for me beside a log fire in the sitting room of his low-beamed riverside house in Bungay, near the Suffolk coast, to which the family moved in 1990. He is a spirited talker, quick to digress, his attention wandering now over the jazz trio in which he used to play as a drummer with Dudley Moore on piano, (when he was an engineering apprentice in Oxford at 17 or 18), now on his use of LSD in 1965, which brought him further insight into the complexities of perception, and now on the axe which he had as a prized birthday present aged eight, and which he employed to chop up his boarding school bed at Dartington, in Devon. All this comes as background to the singularity of vision and blindness and the means by which he has continued to paint. The day before driving up here I had met Sargy at his latest one-man exhibition at the Cadogan Contemporary gallery in Chelsea. It is a strange thing to stand in front of a canvas with a painter who can only imagine his work, a little like being granted sudden access to another man's mind's eye, but though I was leading him by his arm to his pictures before he could describe them, he seemed to see each painting just as vividly as I could. The paintings in this recent London show 2013 large , sun-filled, slightly dislocating, alive with colour and selling for healthy four and five-figure sums 2013 were rooted in a trip Mann had made to Cadaqu 00e9s in northern Spain with his son, Peter, a film-maker, in April 2005. The trip, its light and atmosphere, held a special significance for Mann, because it was the last time he saw anything at all. The seaside village had been chosen for its vertiginous streetscape (blind people above all hate flatness , they have no way of understanding it) , its startling white buildings and the sharp contrasts of light and shade that Mann could still just about decipher. He and his son walked the streets waiting for inspiration. If Sargy got interested in a particular place, a sudden sense of white or blue or orange, he would move about tapping surfaces with his stick, measuring lengths between walls and objects trying to work out some visual coordinates to be filed away. He became obsessed with some bar scenes and had Peter take a mosaic of photographs from his particular vantage that could later be described. Mann planned to paint these scenes as soon as he got home. Father and son returned to England the day before Sargy's 68th birthday, and the family 2013 Frances and their four children 2013 got together to celebrate. It was, he says, a perfect day. The next morning he woke up with a strong pain in his left eye. When he asked Frances to have a look she said Oh my god , it's bleeding. Mann was certain that it was what he had been dreading for a long time: the ulcer on his cornea had perforated causing the eye to collapse; it was the start of total blindness. After some days in hospital Mann returned home , sightless, and wondering what he would do with the rest of his life. He had never been much interested in sculpture, though that was a possibility. He felt his way to his studio by the river, and there the subjects that had most recently been on his mind became insistent: the light and space of Cadaques that he had been planning to paint. Well , I thought, he recalls , I have got a ready stretched canvas and all my paint and brushes that I had imagined giving away , so why not have a go? It was a sunny day , so he put the canvas up on the windowsill outside his studio, carried out his painting trolley to the usual place and started to feel the canvas and imagine his subject: one of the bar scenes he had painstakingly mapped out. After a bit I thought: 'Well here goes ,' and loaded a brush with ultramarine, he recalls. What followed was one of the strangest sensations of my life: I 'saw' the canvas turn blue as I put the paint down. Next I put my Schminke magenta , and 'saw' it turn rose. The colour sensation didn't last, it was only there while I was putting the paint down, but it went on happening with different colours 2026 He didn't look back. Once I had started painting blind , there was no stopping me. It just became the new way of doing it. It was difficult, but art had always been difficult, and having a new set of difficulties was no bad thing. It was , he thought, a bit like a deaf composer hearing orchestra parts in his head. Mann has developed strategies to construct his intense spatial landscapes on the canvas. His horizons have become closer at hand. Putting himself inside a space accurately has became more and more crucial to his work, to getting his bearings. At his house in Bungay he reconstructed some stairs to bring Bonnard's light on to the landing. This space has become a kind of mind map for him. In the dark , he talks me through how he understands it, feeling deftly for edges and corners with his fingers and cane. Once established, the space can become whatever he wants it to be, flooded with the remembered sunshine of the Mediterranean, which he then recreates on canvas, guided by a movable grid of Blu-Tack blobs, and an internalised rush of colour. Over the years in which his sight has become progressively worse, Sargy Mann has been in contact many times with Professor Semir Zeki, of University College London. Zeki is the pioneer the field of neuroaesthetics , a name he coined, and the world's leading authority on the science of how the mind, and in particular how the artist's mind, understands the world. In 2007 Zeki was granted more than 00a31m by the Wellcome Trust to explore the ways in which beauty and art are functions of the physiology of the brain. All great artists, Zeki believes, are instinctive neuroscientists; they have an innate understanding of how the brain sees the world , and they are fated by this knowledge to constantly try to find a correspondent visual language. Zeki pioneered, as long ago as the 1970s, the accepted understanding of the particular way in which the brain projects its concepts of colour on to the world almost from birth. For Zeki, seeing is never a passive process. When we look at a painting, as his sensitive MRI scanning proves, different bits of information are immediately separated and sent to discrete anatomical corners of our brains for processing. Our brains respond to this compartmentalised information at slightly different rates; colour is processed before form, for example, and form before motion. Having been taken apart, as it were, a painting that we love is never simply put back together again in our heads; rather it exists dynamically in the interplay between responses of different parts of the brain. That combination of responses can create a puzzling , powerful and lasting engagement with the image, an emotional response. Artists, Zeki suggests, subconsciously play with these dynamics. A Monet floods the colour centres of the brain, and the areas that understand light, with all sorts of conflicting stimulation, before form ever gets a look in; C 00e9zanne, meanwhile, found a way to make the brain perceive form in tone and texture rather than in the trick of perspective. If an artist discovers such a new language of seeing , Zeki argues, then the receptors in the brains of his or her audience can't get enough of it. The brain demands knowledge , Zeki tells me. It is constantly on the lookout for organising concepts. Art directly feeds that demand with new ways of looking. Zeki is of course intrigued by Sargy Mann's condition , as well as being a longstanding admirer of his work. He has for a while been planning a series of experiments in which he connects the artist's brain to a scanner and ask him to imagine colour alongside people who are seeing it more conventionally, in order to compare the response in the colour centre of the brain, known as V4. This would bear on a more general question , in which I'm also looking at whether mathematicians use a mathematical part of the brain, or literary people have a more developed literary area, he tells me. In Sargy's case it is possible that the increased activity may be elsewhere and not in the colour area , that the brain has found a different way of doing it. In some senses he believes that Sargy's blindness , following from an intimate understanding of colour, is a kind of release. I've been talking with him for many years now and one thing is that since he has become completely blind he doesn't always give a damn exactly what colour he makes an object. In the process he has come up with brilliant colours. Normally we associate different objects more or less with different colours. A lemon immediately invokes yellow , say. But with him it doesn't matter so much. As a result , he suggests, the sighted viewer is intrigued by unaccustomed colour juxtapositions and aesthetically mesmerised by them. Memory of colour is what we all use , all the time, to fill in the world between the lines of form; artists have always sought to liberate themselves from those conventions and look again. I have always argued that the worst thing that can happen to the artistic brain is self censorship , Zeki says. As soon as your brain starts telling you that you can't have a tree that is blue then you stop being able to paint trees. Picasso , of course, was always dreaming of something like the same thing, of forgetting how to look at the world. He said it was easy to paint like an adult but much more difficult to paint like a child. In some ways, certainly in terms of colour, in response to his blindness, Sargy has approached that freedom. Though a great admirer of Zeki's science , Mann himself is a little wary of trying to reduce his vision to neural pathways. As a result the pair have been dancing around each other for a while. Zeki has been threatening to do experiments with me for years , he says , laughing. What he wanted me to do with my head in his MRI machine was very simple. But in order to isolate one variable you have to set up something so completely at odds with how we actually perceive things that I fear it can give you slightly puzzling results. In some ways Sargy is happy for these processes to remain a mystery. Painting is for him an emotional event as much as a scientific one. He likes to adapt a quote by Philip Larkin about poetry to describe what he does: Painting is a visual device for preserving an experience from oblivion , he says. For me that means making the world look more like itself. Now that is obviously nonsense , because I can no longer see. But I don't really feel that I have had to abandon any of these thoughts. This emotional reclamation has come to rest , since he lost his sight, on what Mann can touch. Though he had rarely painted the human figure before he lost his sight, his first series of paintings after he went blind focused on Frances. Because I couldn't see people any more it became more important to paint them , he says. And Frances in particular , of course. It became terribly important. I suppose you always paint the things you most want to see. Does he ever mourn that possibility? I haven't really spent much time at all being miserable about my loss of sight. I haven't grieved for it. I have a moment every few days when I am painting , when I think 'Oh fuck, I wish I could see that'. And when my daughter has her baby, soon, I may have some moments of wishing I could see it, but I will hold it and smell it and that's the way my life works now, and it's a good life. I wonder if he thinks things would have been different if his sight had gone suddenly , rather than over decades? I was saying to someone at the private view , he says , how incredibly lucky I have been. I had about 25 years' apprenticeship for going blind. It was a bugger , but I kept working out how to paint over those 25 years, and my brain kept finding new ways to see the world, if you like. Does he think that painting as he does it nowadays can be anything like a substitute for looking , a reminder of how it felt? Well , he says , after a long pause. The reality of doing it is mundane. Today I went back to a painting I have been thinking about. To start to get back into it I started to measure and check where the Blu-Tack was and move it a bit , my crazy bits of 3D. And then I thought I would whack some more paint on. I got some neat orange on a brush and it felt really good. I played a bit of cricket as a boy and I've always likened picking up a brush to a cricketer picking up a cricket bat, just that act fills you with possibility of hitting it out of the middle. There is not so much of that for me now, but it's still more than enough to get me up in the mornings.  ",

   "input": "It has been called one of the great art heists of the 20th century. For more than 50 years, the identity of the master art thief who stole Goya's portrait of the Duke of Wellington from the National Gallery in London has been a mystery. But a confidential director of public prosecutions (DPP) file released at the National Archives last week finally identifies the thief as the 20-year-old son of a retired Newcastle bus driver , who had told the police he had done it to draw attention to my father's campaign against pensioners having to pay the BBC licence fee. The theft of the Goya portrait in 1961 , which had been valued at 00a3140,000 (more than 00a32m at today's prices), was the first time a painting had been stolen from the National Gallery. Its director offered his resignation and it led to an official inquiry into security at Britain's national galleries and museums. But the Scotland Yard reports and his statements to the police in the newly released DPP file suggest that the culprit was far from being a sophisticated balaclava-clad master thief. Just before dawn on Monday 21 August 1961, John Bunton 2013 a temporary van driver living not far away in digs off Tottenham Court Road 2013 stood on a parking meter to get over the gallery's back wall. He then used a six-metre ladder left by builders to climb through the unlocked window of a men's toilet to get into the main building of the gallery. The painting was standing on an easel in a roped-off enclosure at the top of the main stairs. I went up to it , took hold of it, and carried it back to the gents toilet, he told the police. He climbed back out of the window , down the ladder, and retraced his steps to the back wall by St Martin's Street. I climbed over the wall , still holding the picture in one hand ... I put the picture on the back seat of the car and drove back to [his furnished room in] Grafton Street. I then put the picture under my bed. Bunton said that he hadn't carried a jemmy and if the toilet window had been shut he would have had to give up. He had to push-start the small black Wolseley that he used as a getaway car. Not only has Bunton never been prosecuted for the theft of the Goya , his identity would never have been known had he not panicked when he was arrested and fingerprinted in Leeds in July 1969 for a minor offence. He was worried that he had left his prints at the National Gallery or on the stolen painting and told officers that he wanted to tell them about something that had been bothering him for some time. As it happened, his fingerprints were not identical to the marks that the police had on file in the Goya case. But Detective Inspector George Chandler, who had led the investigation into the art theft, was inclined to believe John Bunton's confession. Four years earlier, in 1965, John's father, Kempton, a then 61-year-old unemployed Newcastle bus driver living on 00a38 a week national assistance, had stood trial for the theft of the painting after walking into West End Central police station. Six weeks before his confession, a left luggage label had been sent to the Daily Mirror and the painting recovered from the left luggage office at Birmingham New Street station. Although he was cleared of stealing the Goya, Kempton Bunton was imprisoned for three months for the offence of larceny of the picture frame. The theft had sparked a national sensation because, before confessing, Bunton Sr had sent a series of anonymous notes to the press. The act is an attempt to pick the pockets of those who love art more than charity , the picture is not and will not be for sale 2013 it is for ransom - 00a3140,000 2013 to be given for charity, said one note. The case became so famous that a copy of the picture appeared in a 1962 Bond film , with Sean Connery remarking: So there it is , when he sees it in Dr No's Jamaican lair. It was actually in a cupboard in Kempton Bunton's council flat in Newcastle. Although he told the police he had stolen the artwork , they had always found it hard to believe. As Chandler put it in his 1969 report to the DPP: At the time of the offence , Kempton was 57 years old. He is a tall heavily built man, who now weighs somewhere in the region of 18 stones, and it is extremely unlikely that he would have had the agility to scale the outer wall and make his way unaided to the toilet window. He would also in my view been incapable of returning to the wall and climbing over it, without causing some damage to the painting, whereas his son, John, who at that time was only 20 years of age, is still of good physique and would have been quite capable of taking the painting in the manner in which he describes. John Bunton said it had not entered his head to destroy or sell the picture instead of giving it to his father. He intended to use it as a tool in his campaign and that it should ultimately be returned to the National Gallery. When the police asked why he or his brother , Kenneth, who knew the secret, hadn't come forward when his father faced an Old Bailey trial, he replied: He told us not to. Ordered us. It was his wish. Sir Norman Skelhorn , the DPP, told the police that John Bunton's admission alone wasn't sufficient to prosecute him. As for his father, the DPP ruled it would be difficult to prosecute him for perjuring himself at the Old Bailey as they would have to rely on the evidence of the son, who was clearly an unreliable witness. So no further action was taken. It appears that John Bunton may have got away with one of the 20th-century's great art thefts .  ",

   "input": "Fans of the reality TV show Shark Tank love to watch investors Mark Cuban and Daymond John make entrepreneurs sweat after they 2019ve delivered their pitches for money. Less famous are the sharks who will circle Brigham & Women 2019s Hospital in Boston Monday for an event called Pilot Shark Tank. They 2019re doctors and nurses like Calum MacRae and Karen Conley, and they 2019ll be offering something that may be more valuable than money: a chance for health care entrepreneurs to pilot-test new technologies or services in their departments. Over the last two years, Boston has seen a surge of hackathons, accelerator programs, innovation showcases, and other events designed to bring t-shirt clad entrepreneurs closer to physicians in lab coats. And that has produced a bumper crop of small startups with ideas for applying technologies such as smartphones, sophisticated data analytics, and Google Glass in the health care sector. But entrepreneurial eagerness will only get these companies so far: Health care professionals are insanely busy, and not many have time to meet with a dozen startups proposing similar solutions to a problem. Entrepreneurs also must navigate hospital bureaucracies, including review boards that must approve research and clinical trials for anything new. Software products face particularly intense scrutiny because of security and privacy issues. 201cThe biggest gap in the innovation ecosystem isn 2019t funding, 201d says Lesley Solomon, director of strategy and innovation at Brigham & Women 2019s Biomedical Research Institute. 201cIt 2019s the ability to pilot and get feedback and get thoughtful input from clinicians. It 2019s never going to be an easy process, but with the Pilot Shark Tank, we wanted to create an easier way to pilot within the Brigham. 201d In addition to organizing Monday 2019s event, Solomon helped put together the hospital 2019s first weekend-long hackathon event last September, which brought together 150 entrepreneurs, students, and hospital employees to work on 17 different projects related to topics such as managing chronic disease outside the hospital. A handful of the projects, proposed and built over a few days, developed into startups. Hospitals have always played a big part in Boston 2019s innovation economy. But traditionally, they licensed their scientific discoveries and patents to startups or larger companies. Often, those companies would recruit department heads and other medical experts to serve on advisory boards. Occasionally, docs would launch companies of their own. The new approach is less formal, a lot more like inviting a bunch of friends over to help prepare a dinner party. At last year 2019s Hacking Pediatrics event at Boston Children 2019s Hospital, for instance, a pediatric gastroenterologist, a nutritionist, and a handful of techies and business people came together to create a project that would help families find recipes that address food allergies or health issues like celiac disease. That project, originally called RightByte, won the $3,000 top prize at the event, and is evolving into a company called Kindrdfood (pronounced 201ckindred food 201d). Some hope all of this entrepreneurial energy can be focused like a proton beam on some of the biggest problems in health care, like knowing more about what patients do between office visits, or reducing costs. 201cThe medical-academic-industrial complex is failing health care today, 201d says Zen Chu, an entrepreneur-in-residence at MIT and founder of the H@cking Medicine program there. 201cWhen you look at metrics in the US today, in terms of cost and quality, it 2019s just failing. But great things can happen when you bring in fresh eyes from outside of health care, combined with people on the front lines. 201d At Brigham & Women 2019s, Solomon says that as health care reforms increase pressures on hospitals to control costs, they are searching for new efficiencies. But with so many startups pitching mobile apps and cloud-based software, evaluating which ones are worth experimenting with can induce cephalgia (aka headaches.) 201cOften there are 10 companies with the same idea, and we have to figure out which one we should be testing, 201d she says. Making it through that filter presents a real challenge for startups, which must collect data that proves their products can make a medical or financial impact. Jacob Sattelmair, chief executive of Boston-based Wellframe, says that having both an administration and clinical 201cchampion 201d inside organizations like McLean Hospital and South Shore Hospital has helped him get collaborations going. Wellframe sells an online system to help doctors deliver guidance to patients with on-going conditions like mental illness. There 2019s also the issue of money to fund research studies, recruit patients to participate, and analyze data that could eventually be published in a medical journal. 201cBig companies have budgets for all of that, 201d says Yechiel Engelhard, chief executive of Cambridge-based GeckoCap. 201cBut even $50,000 or $100,000 is real money for a startup to spend on a clinical trial. 201d GeckoCap, which makes a small wireless device to monitor a child 2019s use of an asthma inhaler, began at a hackathon event at MIT two years ago; Engelhard says that children will finally begin getting devices to test 201cin the next few months. 201d Nick Dougherty will pitch his startup, VerbalCare, on Monday at the Pilot Shark Tank. It aims to improve communications between patients and caregivers. The Franciscan Hospital for Children in Boston is already testing the system. But Dougherty acknowledges that the mortality rate for startups in health care will be higher than other industries. 201cA company like Snapchat can throw something into the App Store and get a ton of downloads, 201d Dougherty says. 201cThat isn 2019t possible for us. If we start a dialogue with doctors today, we 2019ll be lucky to have a contract in hand in a couple of quarters. 201d  ",

In Japan, though, 201cthe program continues 10 more minutes, 201d writes psychologist and scholar Hiroshi Azuma in Japanese frames of mind: cultural perspectives on human development. The criminal talks about his life, his feelings, his conscience, and 201che apologizes. 201d The detective shakes his hand 201cand encourages him to start a new life when he finishes his prison term. 201d Through the lens of Olympus 2019 alleged fraud, we are watching an alternative ending to a story of corporate malfeasance. Olympus has been able to preserve its listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange 2014 and its example is one that U.S. companies seeking to build trust would be wise to consider. What might we emulate? After claims of no problems as late as October, Olympus 2019 alleged fraud has been followed in recent months with independent reviews that have been made public, condemning the company 2019s actions. To be clear, it 2019s not that Olympus didn 2019t know how to commission a whitewash report. Its board of auditors (an oversight structure in Japan that does not exist in the U.S.) commissioned such a report in May 2009 and found no wrongdoing. But in contrast, the December 2011 independent third party report by five attorneys (including former judges) and one accountant hits hard. The publicly available English version of the report doesn 2019t say Olympus 2019 management is rotten to the core, as had been earlier reported. What it does say is damning enough: 201cthe core of management was corrupted, and the periphery was also contaminated, 201d and 201cThere were many yes men among the directors, and it must be considered the Board of Directors had become a mere formality. 201d Curtis Milhaupt, professor of Japanese corporate law at Columbia, says the frankness of the report is a 201cgood sign for Japanese corporate governance 201d and, as professor Mark Roe at Harvard Law says, it shows an Olympus committee much 201cmore willing to be negative 201d than we are used to seeing in similar reports in the U.S. The oft-praised report commissioned by the Enron board and even reports commissioned by the government and bankruptcy courts, such as the recent Financial Crisis Inquiry Report or the Valukas report on Lehman, describe lapses of oversight but do not contain clear, pointed characterizations or condemnations of the sort the Olympus report provides. Making the full, uncensored text of such a candid company commissioned report publicly available is unusual enough by U.S. standards. But rather than hide the details of the many twists and turns in this remarkable saga as many U.S. companies might do, the top third of the home page of the Olympus website directs you to the timeline and relevant documents. In large letters, the web page reads: 201cTaking this opportunity, we once again extent (sic.) our deepest apologies to Olympus shareholders, customers, business partners, and all stakeholders, for the significant trouble we have caused them. 201d This is not the kind of language we are used to seeing on U.S. company websites when the jig is up. Even if the Japanese meaning may be slightly different, the idea of such a bold admission and apology is worth considering. Although we in the West often view ourselves as open and outspoken, as Tim Phillips points out in his delightfully amusing Talk Normal, we in fact live in a culture with a pervasive reluctance to call something what it is. 201cProblems 201d become 201cissues, 201d Phillips says, and the gobbledygook language we use creates a 201cworkplace [that behaves] as a cult. 201d Workers may have a sense of belonging but are also encouraged to fall in line and to 201ctake on the values of the workplace, 201d whether they agree or not, as a prerequisite to hold their jobs and be considered to be 201cperforming at work, 201d he says. What Phillips describes, is precisely what allows these scandals to occur and perpetuate in the first place. Admit, don 2019t deny 2013 and apologize Following the December 6 independent report, current Olympus President Shuichi Takayama issued a statement the next day saying, 201cit has become clear that the company postponed over many years recognition of losses 2026 [due to] defects in the corporate governance of the Company. I, on behalf of the Company, deeply apologize for the trouble to all related persons that this has caused 2026. It has become clear that [those responsible including board members] will not be able to escape from liabilities. 201d A news announcement on December 21 included this closing line: 201cThe Company would like to again take this opportunity to offer sincerely its deepest apologies 2026. 201d Find out who is responsible and sue them yourself Boards in the U.S. are relationship-oriented. And in that, they share much in common with Japanese culture: 201cTo condemn someone 2026 prematurely without sufficient justification is inappropriate everywhere but especially so in a relationship-oriented culture where interpersonal ties assume priority and being sympathetic to others is a moral imperative. One way to do this is to withhold judgment until a detailed story is available, 201d Azuma writes. In the December 7 letter, Takayama explains that shareholders asked the company to pursue a damages suit against the directors. Such requests by shareholders aren 2019t unusual in the U.S., says University of Akron Law School professor Elizabeth Shaver, but generally U.S. companies leave it to shareholders to pursue the matter. Olympus set up commissions that moved swiftly to determine who was at fault. And the company, represented by the board of auditors, has brought lawsuits against named directors, including Takayama, who is being sued for $500 million yen. While it 2019s true the U.S. doesn 2019t have a board of auditors structure, wouldn 2019t it be refreshing if boards pursued justice for their stakeholders themselves rather than forcing shareholders to do so on behalf of the company? It would certainly send a powerful signal to the capital markets, executives, and directors themselves if boards were to pursue wrongdoers directly. According to the 2012 Edelman Trust Barometer survey, 11% of respondents don 2019t trust Japanese businesses to tell the truth while over three times that percentage (38%) don 2019t trust U.S. companies to be honest. Over the last few months, Olympus has been willing to bend its pride and do what was required to survive this scandal. A cynical response would be to say, 201cWhat choice did they have? 201d Olympus is not to be applauded for its alleged fraud or cover-up, but if U.S. companies take note of the good Olympus has done in the last few months, they 2019d help to build trust in U.S. companies, improving our ability to attract capital and turn our economy around.

The settlement requires the second-largest US bank to reduce some homeowners 2019 loan balances, provide new loans to low-income buyers, and address areas of neighborhood blight. But consumer advocates say relatively few people will be helped relative to the devastation triggered by the mortgage bonds, which fueled the worst financial crisis since the 1930s and threw millions of homes into foreclosure. Only a fraction of homeowners would be eligible for refinancing under the settlement. And the process by which people would qualify and receive aid could drag on for years, with payouts set to be completed as late as 2018. Those who have already lost homes to a foreclosure or a short sale 2014 when a lender accepts less money from a sale than what the borrower owes 2014 wouldn 2019t likely benefit at all. 2018 2018It is certainly better than nothing, 2019 2019 said Bruce Marks, chief executive of the nonprofit Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America. 2018 2018But for the millions who lost their homes, it reinforces the appearance that the government has not been on their side. 2019 2019 Monnette Holland had been anxiously waiting the settlement, wondering if it might save her four-bedroom home in Franklin, Va. 2018 2018It has been a nightmare, 2019 2019 she said. Holland had refinanced her house in 2006 with Countrywide, a firm that was later bought by Bank of America and that made up the bulk of toxic mortgage securities involved in the settlement. Holland, a 65-year-old former legal secretary, used the proceeds from the refinancing to pay off auto loans and install a new roof and windows. But then her husband was forced into an early retirement at a paper mill. And Holland had to go on disability because of arthritis and other health problems. The couple tried and failed several times to modify their mortgage, only to learn that its owner kept changing: after Countrywide, it was Bank of America, later Specialized Loan Servicing, and most recently Bank of New York Mellon. As an alternative to foreclosure, Holland listed her house 2014 worth $270,000 at its peak 2014 for less than $90,000 in a short sale. A buyer made an offer just days before the Justice Department settlement was announced Thursday. The Bank of America settlement will include the appointment of an independent monitor to review the consumer relief. This could take weeks and mean that 2018 2018thousands of people who right now are in default or foreclosure 2019 2019 will miss the chance to reduce their mortgage balances, said Shanna Smith, president of the National Fair Housing Alliance. Smith 2019s organization has investigated the fallout from the foreclosures. It has filed a complaint with the Department of Housing and Urban Affairs that banks failed to maintain properties after borrowers defaulted. The alliance said it found Bank of America enabled foreclosed homes in minority communities in Orlando, Denver, Memphis, Atlanta, and elsewhere to slide into disrepair. As part of the consumer relief, Bank of America has essentially pledged to help remedy the neighborhood blight its neglect helped cause when it auctioned off foreclosed homes at steep discounts, Smith said. Bank of America had initially resisted a settlement, because almost all the bad mortgage securities that led to the settlement came from Countrywide and Merrill Lynch, the two troubled firms the bank acquired in 2008 as the financial meltdown erupted. But a federal judge in Manhattan ruled in a separate case that Bank of America was liable for those premerger mortgages and issued a penalty of nearly $1.3 billion. That helped spur the bank to forge a deal  ",

   "input": "Summer and winter are safe, but when David Hockney turned up to begin work on spring, he found a scene which the artist described as a massacre; the sky empty , and the ground littered with the limbs of fallen giants. Nothing remains except stacks of sawn trunks and branches of the little copse of mighty sycamores and beeches near his home in East Yorkshire which he had intended to paint in all seasons. Hockney found the trees as he found all his subjects, by driving for hours around narrow side roads. The small copse, at a T junction south of the village of Warter was one of two narrow strips planted over a century ago at right angles, on private land as a shelter belt for farm buildings and wide open fields. They appear to have been felled to sell the valuable timber. I knew I was coming back to do more , but I didn't think there was any rush about it, he said yesterday. The two paintings of the copse , reproduced for the first time in the Guardian, will be included in an exhibition next month at the W 00fcrth museum in K 00fcnzelsau, Germany. They are now the only record Hockney will make of the wood in its glory. I admit this may matter only to me. Perhaps nobody else would feel like this - and it was on such a remote little road hardly anyone else even saw them , perhaps two cars an hour might pass that way. But to me there was something shocking about the scene. The landscape I remembered was gone completely, and what remained looked like a scene from the first world war. To me even the approach to that little wood had a kind of grandeur , like the approach to some marvellous great temple, and the trees themselves were very large, very architectural, very majestic. I was really quite taken with them. It was like coming into some little village or town and finding that overnight the people had obliterated a great church that had stood there for 900 years. I admit they had a perfect right to do this - but it seems sad. If they had pulled down a great church people would have seen and asked questions , but nobody asked about these trees. Nobody asks enough questions any more. In his late 60s and early 70s the artist once known best for sun-dappled bodies in blue Californian swimming pools , who has flirted with photography and giant collage faxes as art forms, has returned to English landscape on a grand scale. His main home became his house at Bridlington in Yorkshire, and he scoured the surrounding region for subjects. One epic painting, Bigger Trees Near Warter - of another, nearby woodland - took up an entire wall of the biggest room of the Royal Academy's summer show two years ago. The picture is 12m x 5m (40ft x 16ft), made up of 50 smaller canvases, and Hockney said it engulfs the viewer. He later presented it as a gift to the Tate collection, the most valuable ever from a living artist. Hockney came upon the strip of towering trees, framed by two narrow roads and a scrap of triangular green, about two years ago. He returned, taking hundreds of photographs and making scores of sketches. House guests came to know the trees well too: he insisted on some friends getting up before dawn, to accompany him to see the light hit the trunks at a particularly cherishable angle at about 6am. They were very struck at the effect , he said firmly. He has completed two paintings , 3m by 4m each, showing bare winter branches, and summer's towering greenery. He last visited the wood two months ago, and returned on Wednesday to start sketching and photographing for spring, hoping the first leaves might just be starting to break on the trees. Instead he found a scene of desolation. I thought first they had gone for housing , but now I believe that can't be right in such a remote spot. I think they were just harvested, as if they were any other crop - and though they had a perfect right to do it, it still seems very sad.He went back again yesterday with his camera - and though he still mourns the lost trees was impressed by the patterns of the massive stacked trunks. I think now this is my next painting of the wood. It will be very different - but the piles of wood are quite beautiful in their own right , simply because wood can't help being beautiful. 2022 This article was amended on Thursday 2 April 2009. The museum where David Hockney's paintings of a copse in East Yorkshire will be exhibited this month is the W 00fcrth , not Wurtz, in K 00fcnzelsau, not Kunzelsau. This has been corrected.  ",

   "input": "Here 2019s one way to recognize a stolen car: It 2019s probably pretty old. Thanks to a surge of advanced anti-theft technology, stealing newer cars is remarkably tough. That 2019s led to a dramatic decline in auto theft, in Massachusetts and throughout the United States. 201cWe 2019ve made major strides, and technology, I think is probably the key player in this, 201d said Roger Morris, a spokesman for the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB), an insurance industry trade group. According to the bureau 2019s 201cHot Wheels 201d list of the top 10 most stolen cars, in 2013 the nation 2019s most victimized vehicle was the Honda Accord. But the great majority of the 53,000 stolen Accords were built in the 1990s. You 2019ll see similar numbers for the other cars on the list. Cars eight years or older dominated the rankings; very few recent vehicles made the cut. Meanwhile, the overall rate of auto theft has plummeted. 201cThe volume of thefts is nothing like it used to be, 201d said David Procopio, a spokesman for the Massachusetts State Police, which shut down its dedicated auto theft task force about two years ago. In 1975, the Commonwealth had the highest car theft rate in the nation, but since then it has fallen by about 90 percent. Nationwide, car theft peaked in 1991 and has dropped 65 percent since. Much of the credit goes to aggressive policing, but even more important wasthe development of cars that are far harder to steal. A horde of antitheft devices have become almost universal over the past decade. Most important was the immobilizer, a system that prevents a car from starting unless the driver uses a key that 2019s recognized by the computer network built into virtually all modern vehicles. 201cThat 2019s probably the biggest thing that 2019s happened to theft rates, 201d said Bill Biondo, a technical fellow in global vehicle security at General Motors Corp. Born in the late 1980s, immobilizers first appeared in luxury cars, but by the early 21st century they were standard on nearly all vehicles. 201cGone are the old days of two and three decades ago when a car thief could jimmy into the vehicle, use a screwdriver to defeat the steering column, connect the ignition wires, and take the car, 201d Procopio said. Immobilizer technology has largely eliminated casual car theft. But the professionals are as busy as ever. 201cToday, what you 2019re dealing with is the organized criminal, 201d said crime bureau spokesman Roger Morris. 201cThey 2019re not out there stealing for joyrides. 201d These serious thieves get around modern technology by using old-fashioned fraud. For instance, a criminal may test-drive a new car, but hand in a dummy key when he returns the vehicle. At night, he returns with the real key and drives the car off the lot. Other crooks use stolen identities to 201cpurchase 201d cars on credit. Of course, they never make any payments, but the vehicle won 2019t be reported as stolen until the 201cowner 201d misses a payment or two, and that could take months. Meanwhile, the car has been stripped for parts or loaded into a shipping container for resale overseas. While there are fewer car thefts, it 2019s gotten harder to catch those who have stayed in the game. The crime bureau estimates that fewer than half of stolen cars are ever recovered, compared to a 60 percent recovery rate back in the 1980s. So the search is on for better technology and tactics to keep criminals at bay. The latest Chevy Tahoe SUV from General Motors Corp., for instance, features sensors that set off an alarm if someone tries to jack up the car or if a window is smashed. Even if someone can bypass these sensors, there 2019s an internal motion detector that will ring the alarm if you climb behind the wheel. And of course there 2019s OnStar, the service that connects the car with GM 2019s nationwide wireless network. If an OnStar-equipped vehicle is stolen, GM can limit the speed at which it can be driven, remotely lock the ignition so that it can 2019t be started, and track the car 2019s location. Many car companies offer stolen-car location tracking these days, but the concept was pioneered byLoJack Corp., of Canton. In 1986, LoJack introduced a system that hides a small radio transmitter inside a car. If the vehicle is reported stolen, the local police department sends an activation code to the car 2019s transmitter, which begins broadcasting a homing signal. LoJack has partnerships with about 1,800 law enforcement agencies in 30 US states and the District of Columbia. The agencies use LoJack receivers installed in police cars to pick up the signals from stolen vehicles and track them down. The company says it recovers 90 percent of LoJack-equipped stolen cars. LoJack cars are unmarked; thieves never know they 2019ve stolen one until the cops show up. 201cLet 2019s get the police to recover the vehicle and hopefully arrest the thief, 201d said Patrick Clancy, LoJack 2019s vice president for law enforcement. 201cThat 2019s the covert nature of it. 201d The mere existence of LoJack has scared off many criminals. A 1998 study from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that car theft rates fell 50 percent in Boston, 35 percent in Newark, and nearly 20 percent in Los Angeles after the introduction of LoJack. Even though relatively few drivers installed LoJack, every car in town became less attractive to thieves, who couldn 2019t be sure which vehicles had been LoJacked. These days, LoJack is marketing its service directly to automobile dealers and rental agencies, to help them recover cars stolen by professional fraudsters. 201cThat 2019s a huge problem going on right now, 201d said Clancy 2014 and a reminder that car theft will probably never go away. 201cAs long as there are thieves out there, they 2019re looking for an easy path, 201d said NICB 2019s Morris. 201cCriminals are criminals. 201d But thanks to antitheft tech, the good guys are winning.

   "input": "It is hard to believe in the cold light of day, but on Saturday night 350 well-heeled Wiltshire folk, army people and London arty types formed a procession behind a moving house and a Georgian choir. We were walking, by lantern-light, towards the church of St Giles in Imber, the decrepit but achingly beautiful heart of a village in Salisbury Plain which, in 1943, was emptied of its inhabitants and requisitioned by the army for military use - and never given back. The village no longer exists in any real sense: the public cannot normally come here, and the old buildings have been blown to bits during successive army exercises. They have been reconstructed in breeze block and brick, with blind openings for windows and doors: these are banal, simplified stand-ins for houses, like a child's drawings. They lack the gothic atmosphere of ancient abandoned buildings, but have a squat, dour menace all of their own. Yet at the weekend, lights illuminated their interiors and kitsch music poured out of them from unseen sources: it was as if the houses themselves were making the sounds, playing happy-sad ditties to mark their own deaths and resurrections. This was all part of an event masterminded by London-based commissioning body Artangel. What lay at the end of the procession, however, was a disappointment: a performance in St Giles Church by the Rustavi Choir and the Matrix Ensemble of a new work by the Georgian composer Giya Kancheli. After the atmosphere and poignancy of preceding events, it was a somewhat trite affair. The evening had started, more auspiciously, as the sun set behind us, with the audience being bussed over the chalky plain towards Imber. At first sight the landscape seemed untouched and wild - until you noticed the vehicle tracks incised in the grass and rusting tanks dotting the lonely landscape, while stern signs at the edge of the road warned of Unexploded Military Debris. Deposited in the village , the audience wandered around the unearthly place, watching a driverless Morris Minor repeatedly circle a roundabout - a reference to the car that was used in the 1960s by protesters fruitlessly campaigning for Imber to be returned to its villagers. After a while, the audience paused, and food and wine were served. We were becoming a community, in a peculiar way - there was something of the village fete about it, albeit a forlorn festival for a place without permanent inhabitants. Meanwhile, inside a barn, poignant footage of the villagers' uprooting from their homes was shown. Incongruity was heaped on incongruity as the Rustavi Choir struck up their mournful, rousing strains and the audience (or congregation, perhaps) followed towards the church. There we were, following the full-size house (in fact a structure like a big tent, with printed material laid over a framework), but despite the surreal comedy of it, this was a funeral procession, and we were laying Imber to rest. Aside from the misfiring finale, the evening was a wonderful piece of theatre, with a whole village becoming both set and players, and we the audience transformed into temporary citizens of Imber. Not only incongruous in its form, it was deliciously incongruous in its genesis: the Church of England, Artangel and the British army are unlikely bedfellows. And in an artistic landscape where genre-bending events are all the rage (pace the increasingly feeble Tate and Egg Live collaborations) , it is encouraging to see a work that - albeit flawed - is done with some heart and conviction. 00b7 Yesterday, outgoing Royal Opera House chairman Colin Southgate - shy, sensitive soul that he is - finally took a deep breath and blushingly told the world how he had heroically saved the House from ruin. In fact, until one had read his valedictory interview in the Telegraph, one would have had no idea that he had done so many wonderful things, without, it seems, much help from his underlings. Yes, he singlehandedly stripped away the clubbishness of the ROH; saved the orchestra; prevented a merger with English National Opera; introduced financial control; persuaded the government to hand over 00a325m; appointed Michael Kaiser as chief exec (who was a success , really!); and persuaded Antonio Pappano to work there. And by the way, it wasn't his fault that Ross Stretton, the former Royal Ballet chief who was such a disaster, was appointed. Thank heaven the modest Sir Colin has put the record straight at last. Personally, I will be crying myself to sleep as I mourn his departure. 00b7 If you want to contact Charlotte Higgins, please email arts.editor@guardianunlimited.co.uk marking the email to her attention.

   "input": "GLENDALE, Ariz. -- Based on evidence and expert testimony, the Cardinals seem equipped to treat their fans and NFL peers to an aerial uprising. But one thing they're not quite ready to pass is the go-to-guy torch . . . at least not officially. And that's especially true if you ask one of the guys responsible for inspiring these corresponding expectations. There's not no No. 1 , there's not no No. 2 in our group, said Michael Floyd , now entering his third pro season, at the team's training camp at University of Phoenix Stadium. That's a diplomatic way of reminding us how much respect the former first-round pick has for teammate and mentor Larry Fitzgerald as Fitz begins his slow descent down the sky-high peak of a Hall-of-Fame career. Fitzgerald, it should be noted, certainly didn't slouch into 82 catches -- 10 of those for touchdowns -- last season. He's still rockin' . . . just not in a chair. With solid quarterbacking again and Fitz on the other side, we're only acknowledging that Arizona again has gone stereo for big, bad wideouts. And the 6-foot-2, 220-pound Floyd, who, like his celebrated teammate, grew up in Minnesota, simply served notice of his installation by snagging 65 passes for 5 TDs and a team-leading 1,040 yards -- 87 yards more than Fitzgerald. So the presumption of a friendly takeover in go-to responsibility hasn't been beyond comprehension around the league. Floyd, however, prefers to be one Cardinal who attempts his rise toward stardom while remaining emotionally grounded. There are some plays that are recommended for a certain individual , he said , and without that second guy , that guy won't be open. So we all work for the same common goal, and that's to win ballgames. For the record , that's simply reminding us how Fitzgerald still provokes sufficient fear in the opposition to qualify as a creepy decoy when he's not making plays. Perhaps the time has come for Floyd to serve in a similar role. Anyway, when the topic is Floyd's emergence, you'll get no quarrel from within the organization. Mike is stepping into his own , Fitzgerald said. Carson (Palmer) has a lot of confidence in him , the coaching staff has a lot of confidence in him. When he plays, he's going to get his opportunities, and the ones he got last year he took advantage of. He works his tail off and studies in the classroom. He understands what's expected of him and holds himself to a higher standard. I'm really happy for Mike. For his part , Palmer is definitely buying the Floyd stock. For some supportive, statistical parallels that explain why, let's go back to the 2013 season, during which the first-year Arizona QB opened with at least one interception in the team's first nine games. But he was clean -- in terms of picks -- in games 10 and 11, posting quarterback ratings of 119 and 114, respectively, in victories at Jacksonville and at home vs. Indianapolis. OK, so it may be sort of coincidental, but this brutal efficiency also occurred when Floyd just happened to make 13 catches for 297 yards over those two games, including a 91-yard scoring salvo against the Jaguars. The Cardinals did lose at Philadelphia the next week, but Floyd had 10 catches for 99 yards and a touchdown in that one. I can't say there is a ceiling , the quarterback said when asked if Floyd is approaching the limit of his powers. Mike's a young guy. It doesn't seem like it because of his maturity , but this is his third year. He can do just about everything because he's quick enough. He's a big , physical guy, but he plays quick, he plays small. This praise hardly qualifies as anathema to the chatter trotting alongside Floyd's career. Let's hark back to Minnesota , where Floyd was a really big deal at Cretin-Durham Hall High School. His many accolades included that of Minnesota's Mr. Football and consecutive state Player-of-the-Year distinctions bestowed upon him by representatives of a popular sports drink. *By clicking SUBSCRIBE , you have read and agreed to the Fox Sports Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. Scout.com designated him a five-star recruit in, ranking Floyd as the 16th best high school player in America for the graduating class of 2008. Obviously, big things were expected when he enrolled at Notre Dame . . . and Floyd delivered. That's especially true of the last two seasons in his four with the Fighting Irish. Floyd gave ND 21 of his 37 touchdowns during that time, piling up 1,000 or more yards in each campaign. The Cardinals were impressed enough with his production and physical profile to take Floyd with the 13th overall selection in the 2012 draft. Then they watched him struggle as a rookie. Well, the quarterbacking made it nearly impossible for any Arizona receiver to flourish (Fitzgerald had 71 grabs for a mere 798 yards in 16 games) that season, but it might not have mattered for Floyd had Kurt Warner been around. Arizona coach Bruce Arians wasn't around either, but he understands the process. I think sometimes as a rookie you don't know how to be a pro , Arians said , and you learn from a guy like Larry to be a pro. Then your ability takes over and that's pretty much where he's at. He's just going to climb. While Floyd continues to deftly receive these accolades with admirable restraint , he admits last season's success provided a terrific launching point for his third pro season. It builds it tremendously , he said when the word confidence was mentioned. I'm glad that my quarterback has a lot of confidence in me , knowing that I can make plays on the ball and make plays for him, even though he might be in a jam at times. I feel good , we all feel good, and we're ready to get this thing rolling. Follow Randy Hill on Twitter  ",

   "input": "Franz Ackermann: Home, Home Again White Cube, London N1, until 20 May Franz Ackermann is living proof of the art industry's extraordinary remoteness from the world. Among such circles the German painter can do no wrong. Barely a biennial, scarcely an art fair and nary a major dealer or gallery would pass up the chance of an Ackermann - and they now change hands for record amounts - yet nobody could claim his art had any real public reach. I don't know a single person who has ever seen an Ackermann they liked. A fellow critic says he takes care to avoid them. Saatchi showed some of Ackermann's vast collages of semi-abstract fragments in his German edition of the Triumph of Painting show last year and they were thought frantic, noisy and aimless. Big as billboards and deeply involved in what you might call semiotics - signage, tourism, motels, flight patterns and so forth - and in scrambling the visual signals, they are a breeding ground for jargon and theory. Which may be another reason why a certain generation of curators adore them. But Ackermann thrives, and at 42 shows very energetically at two of the most powerful commercial galleries in the world - Gavin Brown's Enterprise in New York and of course Jay Jopling's White Cube in London. Which is where he is currently exhibiting a whole environment of paintings, photographs, scaffoldings and a floor piece you can shuffle all over, following a line the artist himself took for a walk. Maybe he is getting more poised with age, certainly less hectic and brash, but this is the best I've seen of his work. Ackermann has had a long time to work out precisely what he wants to achieve with his jumble of vignettes and fragments, his flattened spaces and violent colours - and, oddly enough, for something so blatant, it seems to be an art of hints. Trees disappear headfirst into the void, ghostly yachts flit in and out, there are partial views of towerblocks, balconies and malls. You look down a long hotel corridor, ominously empty, and from there to what might be a Japanese teahouse. It's all about tourist-class travel. Paintings vacillate between long-shot and close-up, above and below, inside public buildings and back out on the streets. They are pieced together, patched together, from a welter of images downloaded from the net, photographs and Ackermann's own perpetual globetrotting. A yellow wheel that might be a stadium spins across one vast canvas. Another features a daringly large area of Day-Glo pink that seems, bizarrely, to conflate hints of spaceflight as well as fairgrounds and aquariums. Day-Glo doesn't give off heat so much as ersatz flavour, of an Opal Fruit sort, though it is good for nuclear sunsets and of course imparts instant modernity. Artifice is what it says and unrelievedly artificial is what these paintings want to look. Even where a quite lush little landscape ends in blue remembered hills there'll be a shard of eye-popping colour to kill any sense of nature or nostalgia. Day-Glo pink, green and lime, streamers of acid yellow and burning orange are pinned together with black grids, held in check by slate grey and deep purple. It feels quite hard to get in among it all and look steadily without being pained, but Ackermann manages to keep a whisker away from absolute overload. But to what purpose? German painting today is so full of abstract-figurative hybrids, of broken architecture, artificial colours and depthless flatness. It has been that way since the far better days of Thomas Scheibitz and his terrifically dynamic and chromatic quasi-cityscapes in the Nineties. More than one of Ackermann's compatriots have made a subject out of urban architecture, generally disassembled, and others have also noticed the great metropolitan flux that makes all cities now look much the same. It is hard to read the tone of paintings that make such a point of being too busy to stop. But perhaps there is a kind of joviality at work; certainly in the play on Paul Klee's idea of taking a line for a walk and of visitors literally stumbling round Ackermann's chaotic floor map. Nor could you really say he was setting up a dirge about contemporary life, or even worrying too overtly about terrorism and travel, although there are hints of both. The work seems pretty light, if very accomplished in its sense of abstract design. But the artist's admirers think otherwise. 'The daily practice of painting, in Ackermann's case,' gushes one, 'amounts to nothing less than an attempt to redefine the discipline itself.' If that means anything at all I suspect it refers to his way of painting up to the eleventh hour before a show's opening, of trying to keep an image in flux as long as he can. Unless, of course, it relates to something more specific about his work - the fact that he doesn't seem to want one picture to stand out more than another. Ackermann's kind of high-wire act could go in two directions: towards complete breakdown and shambles, or towards knife-edge balance. Which is very much his achievement this time. But in noticing this over and again through the show you become aware that the paintings are ultimately indistinguishable from each other.  ",

He tried to stir the nation to address the gaping inequality of wealth in our society. But, again, he did not use any of the digital tools that school children now routinely employ, when presenting assigned reports to their classes, to render his arguments vivid and convincing. Likewise, Obama spoke of a pressing need to address climate change, but failed to display any of the evidence that he might have enlisted to establish the existence of such a need: charts or graphs of rising average temperature readings over the past century; video of melting glaciers or meteorologic events believed to be attributable to such change; animations displaying our retreating shorelines in recent years. By contrast, think of the nearly magical techniques Al Gore 2013outside the political context 2013used to make these points nearly a decade ago in the movie An Inconvenient Truth (2006). Would presidential addresses lose dignity if such techniques were employed? Someone must think so. Maybe it goes back to H. Ross Perot 2019s third-party candidacy in 1992. In those pre-Powerpoint years, the businessman awkwardly held up his own charts 2014the kind that might have been placed on an easel in his boardroom 2014and tried to show the nation why it should have been alarmed by the skyrocketing federal debt, the plummeting purchasing power of the dollar, stagnating wages, and, in fact, the growing inequality of income. Maybe it was Perot 2019s big ears, short stature, and funny voice. Maybe it was the incongruity of a CEO crudely wading into politics, or the fact that genuinely eccentric features of Perot 2019s personality eventually cast a pall over his campaign. But people do still talk very dismissively about 201cPerot and his charts. 201d On the other hand, Perot got 19% of the vote in 1992 2014the best third-party showing since Theodore Roosevelt in 1912. At one point 2014till his eccentricities came to the fore 2014he was drawing 39% in polls. A quarter century ago, when TV monitors, laser-disk technologies, animations, and other digital advancements first began creeping into courtrooms, some lawyers 2014mainly on the defense side 2014declined to stoop to using such populist bells and whistles. I wrote about the phenomenon then 2014in May 1990! 2014in a comically dated piece for The American Lawyer entitled, 201cNow Showing In A Courtroom Near You. 201d At a trial before U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin in Washington, D.C., the plaintiffs lawyer had martialed these electronic technologies to dazzling effect. When the defense lawyer stood up for his summation, he told Sporkin, with John Houseman-like pride, that he was going to present his case 201cthe old-fashioned way, with paper and voice. 201d Sporkin cut him off. 201cDon 2019t knock the new way, 201d he said. 201cI am telling you it is sensational.

Indonesian officials are making secret preparations for the executions of Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, even as the federal government urges them daily to reconsider. Lawyers for the men had hoped a challenge of their clemency denial would at least put a pause on the executions. But Indonesia's Attorney-General HM Prasetyo on Tuesday confirmed plans to execute the men are going ahead. It will proceed , he told reporters. We haven't determined the time yet. Denpasar District Chief Prosecutor Imanuel Zebua says officials in Bali , where the two are jailed, are pressing ahead with plans. Australian death-row prisoners Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. (AAP) They had requested instructions from the attorney-general on the transfer of the pair from Kerobokan to Nusakambangan, a prison island off central Java, where five drug offenders were executed last month. Mr Imanuel said the move would be secret, kept even from their families. It could be on the day before the execution and we don't have to tell the family first , he told reporters. We also don't want to tell you (media) either. You could be waiting for us at the airport. Chan ,31, and Sukumaran,33, would be allowed to make a last request, the prosecutor said, and that could be done at Bali's Kerobokan jail rather than on Nusakambangan. President Joko Widodo denied the men clemency despite their rehabilitation, which is supported by a flurry of testimonies in recent days from present and former inmates. Lawyers for the Sydney men will challenge the presidential decree that denied them clemency without looking at their circumstances in an administrative court. They had hoped the executions would be put on hold, pending the court action. The Bali Nine ringleaders' families travelled to Jakarta on Monday, where Sukumaran's mother Raji made a heartfelt plea. She said her son and Chan were unlike other prisoners, having dedicated themselves to rehabilitating other inmates with classes in art, cooking and computers. The families returned to their twice-daily jail visits on Tuesday. Chan's father Ken, who recently underwent surgery after a fall, saw his son for first time in three years. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop says the government, including Prime Minister Tony Abbott, is making daily representations in a bid to save Chan and Sukumaran.

   "input": "Editor 2019s note: In his new book, Cultural DNA: The Psychology of Globalization,Gunek Bains discusses the soft skills required to engage leaders in a connected world. Below is an edited excerpt: This week, the European Union faces yet another round of discussions as its leaders demand a better economic plan from Greece before releasing the funds the debt-troubled nation needs to prevent, in a matter of days, its default on debts. These last minute frantic scrambles to save the eurozone project are now all too regular and the pattern is likely to continue as other countries in the project lurch into payment crises, experience difficulties in the bond markets or elect governments that reject previously agreed to plans. However, to understand where all this is going, it is helpful to step back and analyze some of the fundamental reasons behind the crisis. Essentially, what happened was that everyone got taken in by the heady catch-up growth of the southern European and Irish economies without discerning whether the momentum was sustainable or the euro project viable. People overlooked the relevance of deep-seated cultural factors to the issue of economic sustainability. The exact same thing is happening with respect to gauging the economic prospects of India, China and other emerging market economies today. It is easy to get caught up with the high, catch-up growth figures in all these regions and not to see the cultural problems bubbling underneath the surface that will, over time, influence whether this performance is sustainable. Global CEOs need to become cultural experts, psychologists, and historians if they are to make the right long-term calls for their companies. The importance of this is illustrated by looking more deeply into the eurozone crisis. The drive to create a single economic entity with a common currency, free movement of people, and consistent rules is predicated on the unstated, but nevertheless strong, assumption that there is a high level of cultural similarity across the nations involved. In one sense this is true; but in another sense the cultural and psychological instincts of Greeks are not the same as those of Germans. This is not to pass judgment on either, but rather to say that beyond obvious and superficial differences 2014 like Greeks being more persistent and ingenious in circumventing EU rules around smoking in public places 2014 there lurked deeper differences in attitudes towards financial and economic matters that the creators of the common currency failed to recognize or were blithely optimistic about. It is now apparent that many of the problems arose from the very different attitudes to economic management, payment of taxes, attitudes to borrowing, and orientation to work that exist in the eurozone and which threaten the whole project or at the least to stymie growth in the region for some time. Going a bit deeper, many of these attitudinal and behavioral differences arise from profound differences in some underlying values. In particular, as will be discussed later, southern European countries have at their core a more religious, relational, and in-the-moment set of values 2014 versus the northern countries where more secular, individualistic, and long-term psychological instincts are more evident. Individualistic cultures require mechanisms other than religious authority or the sanction of one 2019s community to regulate people 2019s behavior, and hence place much greater emphasis on the rules set down by the state or other institutions. In the more relational cultures of southern Europe and Ireland, it is easier to trump rules imposed by more distant institutions; it is the obligations to one 2019s immediate circle that count. Furthermore, if you live in a culture with a more short-term orientation, you are likely to take the plunge when economic opportunities created by, for example, money being available at low interest rates present themselves without thinking too hard about the long-term consequences. This is the case whether you are a government doling out pensions and benefits or an individual making a property investment. But where do these differences in underlying values themselves come from? We can go deeper still. Surprising as it may sound, from a cultural DNA point of view, the different psychological instincts in the southern European countries and Ireland versus northern Europe make sense when one looks at how modern humans settled Europe some 45,000 years ago. As will be demonstrated later, the original hunter-gatherer population of Europe came through two clearly differentiated routes 2014 something that 2019s had a powerful impact on the continent 2019s psychological and cultural DNA. One path was through the Middle East, into Anatolia, then into the Balkans and southern Europe. The other involved a more northerly route through the Caucuses and Western Russia into Eastern Europe, Poland and Germany. Although subsequent severe Ice Age events scrambled the picture later on, many of the peoples in northern Europe are descended from the population that followed the second path, and those in southern Europe, to a greater extent, the first path. Furthermore, when expansion occurred from the ice age refuges, those who moved north coped for tens of thousands of years with a radically different ecological environment compared to that which they left behind in the south. Long-term planning and a sustained work ethic were critical to surviving the bitter winters of the north. Interestingly, there is also considerable evidence that a movement of people from Spain went along an Atlantic coastal route to repopulate Ireland and the west of Scotland. Today, there is still a clear genetic dividing line running through the UK that reflects this movement. What is interesting is that many cultural traits, including Catholicism, map this pattern of entry and diffusion in Europe. The eurozone crisis also follows this exact pattern, including Ireland 2019s involvement. A sound argument can be made for the view that the pattern of migration and the different environmental challenges that humans faced in the south and along the Atlantic Coast lead to their psychological and cultural instincts evolving in a different way from those who had the challenge after the ice age of surviving in the ecological conditions of the north. Understanding the deeper reasons for these difficulties is not just an exercise in intellectual exploration 2014 it also has implications for the future. The Germans will not easily relax on their drive to impose explicit rules and guidelines that drive long-term success 2013 because in the past their survival depended on this attitude. For Greeks, the temptation to take a more short-term, humanistic approach is irresistible. Solving the crisis in a genuinely long-term manner will require surfacing and working on these cultural differences. This will require the northern countries questioning their instincts and adapting as much as the countries who are experiencing the problems. All round it will require empathy for ways of looking at the world that just seem alien from one 2019s own perspective. This will be difficult for all parties but in the absence of this occurring the eurozone project is doomed.

   "input": "The idea of skies filled with autonomous flying robots that change the way people interact with the world has grown in popularity amongst futurists and entrepreneurs alike. Largely absent from the public conversation is a discussion about the inherent shortcomings in unmanned aerial systems: namely that without a human pilot aerial vehicles are flying blind. Autonomous drones can fly extremely well, but they lack perception having zero awareness of other aircraft operating in their immediate vicinity. This makes the idea of dozens (hundreds, or even thousands) of commercial drones navigating the same airspace while avoiding obstacles like planes and power lines unfeasible. Factor in that the majority of aircrafts in the sky these days are manned and it becomes not only unrealistic but also potentially dangerous. But, this could be the year that all that change thanks to two decidedly unsexy technologies that are quietly undergoing mini-revolutions of their own. Neither is brand new, but both are falling precipitously in cost and size. These new breeds of radar and electronic systems could transform both the aviation industry and open the door to a genuine commercial drone revolution. The first technology, automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (or ADS-B), is something most people only hear about after, say, an airliner vanishes like Malaysia Airlines 370 did last year. ADS-B is a pricey, and often heavy, on-board aircraft tracking technology that not only determines an aircraft 2019s own position in space via satellites, but also periodically broadcasts its position and direction. Each broadcast can be picked up not only by air traffic controller towers, but also critically by other aircraft in the area. The automated nature of ADS-B lends itself particularly well to robotic drones since computers are well-suited for the multitasking needed to track multiple aircraft at one time. Transportation authorities are slowly but surely moving toward making ADS-B an industry standard for all manned commercial aviation. Currently, ADS-B isn 2019t required on all aircraft. The still-missing Malaysia Airlines jet was not equipped with the technology, while GermanWings flight 9525 was In the U.S. plans are in place to add the technology to all flights as part of the FAA 2019s NextGen strategy to upgrade national airspace due to the enhanced safety it imparts. Small and inexpensive ADS-B units don 2019t just have major implications for general aviation but for unmanned navigation and guidance as well. If ADS-B components can be made small, lightweight and 2014most importantly 2014inexpensive, they could become industry standard for commercial drones as well. Enter Google GOOG , which recently announced that its engineers have set out to develop small, lightweight ADS-B units that cost less than $2,000. 201cWe think that 2014and we are going to do this 2014we will head-down the trajectory of putting into the marketplace really, really low-cost ADS-B solutions, 201d Dave Vos, the director of Google 2019s Project Wing, said during the International Civil Aviation Organization in March. Project Wing is Google 2019s latest initiative aimed at developing viable commercial delivery drones. Lightweight, sub-$2,000 ADS-B units would create situational awareness for drones allowing them to fly in shared airspace with both unmanned aviation and manned aviation as well as existing air traffic control systems. Similarly, a company out of Bellevue, Wa. called Echodyne is developing a way to incorporate the same kind of sophisticated scanning beam radar used by fighter jets 2014to scan and track objects 2014into the average quadrotor. The company has found a way to replace the typically bulky apparatus that directs radio waves 2014a mechanism known as a phase shifter 2014and replace it with a novel new device made from highly-tuned synthetic materials known as metamaterials. Echodyne has already been able to demonstrate a small electronically scanning radar on a quadrotor drone, one capable of tracking an individual on the ground or avoiding obstacles during flight, but is still prototyping. Echodyne 2019s CTO Tom Driscoll says he is confident that he and his team can get the size down to roughly that of an iPhone6 Plus and the weight down to less than one pound 2014plenty small for most commercially available drones on the market today. Moreover, the cost will be such that commercial drones could come standard with sophisticated scanning array radar. 201cOur canned answer is that Echodyne will be providing radar solutions in the thousands and tens of thousands of dollars, 201d Driscoll tells Fortune. 201cBut we can feasibly see a sub-$1, 000 system. 201d A 360-degree spatial awareness at that price point could 2014either alongside ADS-B or independent of it 2014provide the 201csense-and-avoid 201d capability that drones today sorely lack.

But like car-sharing services, the tuk-tuk has faced some pushback from a handful of cab companies and other shuttle operators 2014 and raised concerns about the vehicles 2019 safety.

   "input": "Not too many years ago it looked as if ships would die out as a mode of transportation. As a means of crossing the world's oceans, they have practically faded away, but as a way of enabling travelers to enjoy a cruise vacation at sea they are flourishing, so much so that at least five liners are now under construction, and a sixth is planned. Going into service in 1982 and 1983 will be the Tropicale of Carnivale Cruise Lines, the Atlantic of Home Lines, the Scandinavia of Scandinavian World Cruises, the Fairsky of Sitmar Cruises and the Nieuw Amsterdam of Holland America Cruises, which is planning a second ship that is not yet named. The first to be completed is the Tropicale, scheduled to enter cruise service next January. Termed the ''ship of the 90's,'' the 30,000-ton vessel will be the ninth largest passenger ship in the world. She is being built at the Aalborg Shipyard in Denmark at a cost of $100 million. The Tropicale will have nine passenger decks, and 95 percent of the cabins will have twin beds that can convert to king-size beds. Each cabin will have its own closed-circuit TV set. The first all-new passenger ship constructed since 1974, the Tropicale will have such advances in engineering as controlled pitch propellers, computerized bridge control, stabilizers and bow thrusters. The navigation bridge will be enclosed and airconditioned, providing protection for the electronic equipment, and the ship's propeller will be controlled directly from the bridge, eliminating the engine room telegraph and permitting greater control of the vesssel during maneuvering. The Tropicale will be operated on the West Coast by Carnival and Westours of Seattle after an initial period in the Caribbean. The ship will leave the Caribbean on May 15,1982, for a trans-Panama Canal positioning cruise and then on June 5 begin a series of sevenday Alaska cruises out of Vancouver with weekly calls at Ketchikan, Juneau, Glacier Bay and Sitka. On Sept. 12 the Tropicale will begin sailing out of Los Angeles on seven-day Mexican Riviera cruises, calling at Cabo San Lucas, Puerto Vallarta and Mazatlan. The Atlantic, a 30,000-ton liner costing about $100 million and capable of carrying 1,155 passengers, is to be launched in La Seynesur-Mer, a suburb of Toulon on the south coast of France. The yard, Constructions Navales et Industrielles de la Mediterranee, is the one that built the Sagafjord for Norwegian America Cruises in 1965. Fitting and completion will take about a year. The Atlantic's delivery date is early March 1982, and the first run, from New York to Bermuda, is planned for April 1982. The Scandinavia is being built at the Dubiegeon shipyard in Nantes, France, and will cost approximately $104 million. She will weigh 20,000 tons and carry 1,600 passengers. When she enters service in July 1982 she will operate between New York and Freeport on Grand Bahama Island, sailing every five days. A feature of the Scandinavia will be her ability to carry 400 automobiles, and passengers booking a round trip between New York and Miami will be offered free transport of their cars. The Scandinavia will connect in Freeport with another Scandinavian World Cruises vessel, the Scandinavian Sun (the former Caribe of Commodore Cruise Line), which is scheduled to begin daily voyages between Miami and Freeport in November. The Scandinavian Sun will also carry autos and will enable travelers to take their cars between New York and Florida. The Scandinavia will have a mechanically operated glass roof over the sports deck, television sets showing first-run movies in each cabin, a multi-channel music and radio system in each cabin and meeting facilities. The Fairsky, a $140 million vessel, is scheduled for delivery during the first quarter of 1983. She will weigh 37,000 tons and have a passenger capacity of about 1,200. Like the Atlantic, the ship is being built by Constructions Navales et Industrielles de la Mediterranee. She is expected to operate in the Caribbean for part of her schedule, with the possibility of seasonal European cruises. The Nieuw Amsterdam of Holland America Cruises is being built at Chantiers de L'Antlantique at St. Nazaire in France. The 32,000-ton vessel is expected to be commissioned on March 31, 1983. She will cost $135 million and have a cruise capacity of about 1,200 passengers. The 11-deck ship will be the third Holland America vessel to be christened Nieuw Amsterdam. The first ship of that name dated from 1906 and was a 17,149-ton liner that sailed the Atlantic between Holland and the United States until 1932. The second Nieuw Amsterdam was completed in 1938 and had a gross tonnage of 36,982. She sailed between Holland and the United States until World War II and was converted to a troopship. Following the war she returned to trans-Atlantic service and later became a cruise vessel, sailing to Bermuda, the Caribbean, South America, the North Cape and the Mediterranean. Costa Party Ships Costa Cruises refers to its ship the Flavia, which sails from Miami to the Bahamas on three- and four-day cruises, as a party ship. The line will add a second party ship to its Bahamas program on April 3 when the Amerikanis begins sailing out of Fort Lauderdale. The threeday Bahamas cruises of both the Flavia and the Amerikanis are to Nassau; the four-day cruises are to Freeport and Nassau. The Amerikanis, on charter from Chandris Cruises, is now sailing from San Juan on Caribbean cruises, the last of which will begin March 21.  ",

MENTAL HEALTH IN AMERICA Patterns of Help-Seeking from 1957 to 1976. By Joseph Veroff, Richard A. Kulka and Elizabeth Douvan. 352 pp. New York: Basic Books. $30. By KENNETH KENISTON THE victory of Ronald Reagan and the concurrent defeat of dozens of liberal candidates and causes suggest to many that the American public has shifted into a deeply conservative mood. It is commonly said that Americans, reacting against the cultural and political liberalism of the 1960's, are turning back toward more traditional roles, institutions and ideologies, seeking a restoration of the good old days before rising divorce rates, working women, the ''me'' generation and the cult of intimacy. But two recent and extremely significant books indicate that the present American mood is based on more complex factors than the ''conservative-reaction'' hypothesis would have it. These studies, written by three social scientists at the University of Michigan's Institute of Social Research, document a steady relaxation of traditional definitions of work, marriage, parenthood and self in the American public, a personal liberalization that runs counter to the apparent growth of political conservatism. The findings, in turn, raise new questions about how to understand the contemporary American state of mind. Both ''The Inner American'' and ''Mental Health in America'' come from almost identical national surveys conducted in 1957 and 1976. (''The Inner American'' describes Americans' attitudes toward themselves and their lives, while its companion volume is a more specialized interpretation of how and why Americans seek professional help.) The 1957 survey, involving a random sample of over 2,000 Americans, was part of a study of how Americans define well-being and how they deal with personal stress. Respondents were questioned for 90 minutes about their behavior and attitudes concerning work, family, self-definition, satisfactions, dissatisfactions and personal crises. In 1976 the same questions, plus a few new ones, were asked of another carefully matched sample of about the same size. These studies, with their analysis of change over two decades, are mandatory reading for anyone seriously interested in what is happening to Americans. The books' importance is partly the result of the almost unprecedented repetition of a lengthy, detailed and carefully designed survey at an interval of about 20 years. But equally impressive is the sophistication of the data analysis, which painstakingly distinguishes changes that result from a demographically transformed population from those that reflect deeper trends. Although written with exemplary clarity, both volumes make great demands upon the reader, for they provide a full account of the complexity of the facts, of the statistical techniques used and of the possibility of other interpretations of the results. --------------------------------------------------------------------- Kenneth Keniston, Mellon Professor of Human Development at M.I.T., is currently working on a study of youth and high technology. The best summary of these studies must start with the authors' own descriptions of the 1976 population in phrases like ''increased concern about an uncertain future ... reduced integration into the social structure ... an increased search for intimacy ... a general increase in taking a psychological orientation to experience.'' The authors carefully analyze, support and qualify each of these descriptions. They find, for instance, the phenomenon of ''increased concern about an uncertain future'' to be especially prevalent among the young, who reported feeling considerably more anxiety than did their 1957 counterparts. Parents worry more about their children, and adults in general worry more about their jobs. Once the effects of an increasingly young, educated population are factored out, it is clear that Americans are less optimistic about the future than they were in 1957. People are no longer willing to postpone happiness until an indefinite future; they define their well-being in terms of the present. The broadest conclusion of these studies is that Americans are moving ''from a socially integrated paradigm for structuring wellbeing, to a more personal or individuated paradigm ... We see the 1957 population taking much more comfort in culture and the 1976 population gathering much more strength in its own personal adaptations to the world.'' For example, both marriage and parenthood are regarded less positively than before; conversely, people more easily accept - or remain neutral toward - those who divorce and or remain single or childless. A ''new investment in self-expression'' has replaced traditional definitions of marital roles, a change reflected in the growing concern for individuation in work. Especially among younger women, sharply increased dissatisfaction with being a full-time housewife goes hand in hand with a more positive conception of paid work as an avenue toward personal fulfillment.

   "input": "The following are questions and answers on New York City's delayed primary elections. The answers were compiled in interviews with city and state officials involved in the case. Q. When will the primary be held? A. City and state officials now believe two primaries are likely - one for the citywide and boroughwide offices, such as Mayor, Comptroller, District Attorney, councilman at large and judge, and the other for City Council district seats. The legal problems shrouding the citywide and boroughwide races could be resolved within days, and a primary for those offices could be held shortly thereafter - possibly as early as next week. The problems with the City Council district races are more complicated and could take weeks or months to resolve. Some officials believe that that primary will not be held before December. Q. Who will set the new dates? A. The dates for primary elections and runoffs are normally set by the State Legislature. City and state officials are already discussing a special legislative session in Albany, to be held as early as next week. Some state officials believe that a Federal court could set a new date for the citywide and boroughwide primary races without action by the Legislature, but that is not certain. Q. What must be done before a date can be set? A. For the citywide and boroughwide races, the United States Justice Department must approve the changes the City Council established in the boundaries of some 300 election districts, about 15 of which involved a change in polling places for some voters. The changes in the 15 polling places have already been approved by the Justice Department, but the changes in the other districts are still under review. In the case of the City Council district races, the Justice Department will have to be satisfied that the redrawn City Council districts - which increased the number of districts from 33 to 35 - did not have the effect of discriminating against black or Hispanic voters. This is expected to take considerably longer. The Justice Department has until late October to make its determination. Q. Will the court then have to approve the agreement? A. Yes. To avoid legal challenges of the citywide and boroughwide elections, the city may have to ask the three-judge Federal court to lift its injunction against those primary elections. With regard to the City Council district elections, several lawsuits over the new lines will remain pending even if the Justice Department decides the districts do not discriminate against minorities. These challenges will have to be resolved before the elections proceed. Q. What other considerations are there in setting the dates? A. The Legislature does not schedule elections to fall on a Jewish holiday, of which there are several in the coming weeks. Q. Will candidates have to go through the whole process of collecting petitions again? A. For the citywide and boroughwide races, probably not. But if the Justice Department does not accept the City Council district lines as they were drawn, or if the lines are rejected by the courts, the entire process will have to start anew. The Legislature will have to establish a new political calendar to give candidates time to collect signatures and opponents time to challenge them, as well as dates for a primary and a runoff. The calendar usually stretches across three months, although it could be shortened slightly because of this unusual situation. Q. Would that mean that new candidates may enter the race? A. Yes. If a new political calendar is set, any candidate who could qualify could enter. Q. What happens to the general election? A. No one is sure. The date of the general election is set by the State Constitution, not by an act of the Legislature, and cannot be changed. If the problems with the citywide and boroughwide races are resolved in t ime, the general election for those offices will probably go o n as scheduled. But it is doubtful that the City Council dispu tes will be resolved in time to hold the general election then . One possibility is that the Federal courts could supersede the state and order an election at a date later than the State Constit ution provides. Q. What if all this is not resolved before Dec. 31, when the current terms end? A. That is entirely unclear. The State Constitution provides that the terms of the officials involved ''shall expire at the end of an oddnumbered year.'' State legal experts believe these offices would legally become vacant at that time. Although the Legislature could pass a law extending the current terms, that would be open to legal question, as would any actions taken by the City Council until formal elections were held. Q. How much will this dispute cost? A. A primary usually costs the city about $2. 5 million. If only one additional day of voting is necessary, the di spute will have added $1.5 million to the cost. If an additional da y of voting is necessary, the cost will be still higher. In addition, $11, 000 is spent on expense allowances for each day the Legislature meets in Albany.

By a 230-to-188 vote, the House last week approved legislation that would allow the builders - a consortium of pipeline companies who haven't been able to arrange financing to complete the project under existing rules - to shift some of their financial risks to consumers. The Senate approved the bill, one of the more fiercely lobbied measures taken up in the 1981 session, on Nov. 19. President Reagan is expected to sign the act. The measure allows surcharges on users of natural gas to cover some of the cost of the pipeline before they begin to receive any gas - or even if they never get any should the project flop. The bill would also permit the builders to pass along to consumers the cost (perhaps as much as $4 billion) of building a plant to process the natural gas before it is pumped through the pipeline. The consortium claimed that the potential liability amounts to no more than $1.50 a month for the average residential customer. Some critics said a $12-a-month increase would be a more likely outcome. ''This is nothing more than a subsidy for the oil companies,'' complained Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat. Other critics said they would continue their fight in court. The pipeline, tentatively scheduled for completion in 1987, would move natural gas over 4, 800 miles from the vast reserves of Alaska's Prudhoe Bay to distribution centers in the Middle West and the Far West.

In short, they are offering the kind of fare that, depending on one's point of view, is (1) necessary to help pay the rent or (2) symptomatic of what ails the publishin g industry. While critics point to the lists as examples of how difficult it is to publish anything but low- or middle-brow books, publishers are quick to point to the same lists and insist that that there is a less commercial side to the publishing coin. Random House, for example, will publish six first novels, four volumes of poetry, a collection of stories and ''The Random Review 1982,'' a collection of poems, stories and essays edited by two Random editors, Gary Fisketjon and Jonathan Galassi. ''This must amount to a fourth or fifth of our entire new list,'' said Carol Schneider, Random's publicity director. In addition, Alfred A. Knopf, a subsidiary of Random House, has two first novels scheduled, three books of poetry and one collection of stories, while Pantheon Books, a division of Random House, has two first novels on its list. Farrar, Straus & Giroux plans to publish 37 new titles from March to August, including nine essay collections (two by Roland Barthes), 16 translations, one volume of poetry and one first novel. The Viking Press, with some 60 adult hard-cover titles due for publication through July, has four first novels on its list, a collection of essays, a collection of short stories by Maxine Kumin and three collections of poetry, including selected poems of Pushkin translated by D.M. Thomas, author of ''The White Hotel.'' Simon & Schuster's spring list of 100 titles includes five first novels, a collection of short stories and a book of essays. Charles Scribner's Sons has four first novels and one short-story collection among its 62 spring titles, while the 45 new titles from Atheneum, a division of the Scribner Book Companies, include four first novels, two books of essays and four volumes of poetry. The poetry books include a volume by James Merrill, who won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry and two National Book Awards. The Houghton Mifflin list of 62 titles includes six first novels, three collections of poetry and the ''Letters of Archibald MacLeish,'' almost 400 letters covering more than 70 years. In the first six months of 1980, Little-Brown published 12 first novels. Only two first novels are listed among its 54 titles for this year, but it will publish one book of poetry, a book of essays and interviews by Norman Mailer, ''Pieces and Pontifications,'' and three memoirs, including Henry Kissinger's ''Years of Upheaval.'' The above figures do not add up to a comple te picture, since some of the first novels also appear to be blatant ly commercial, and some of the collections of poetry, stories and ess ays are written by wellestablished novelists, which means less f inancial risk on the part of the publishers. ''But the figures mea n that we are in no way cutting back on first novels or other serious or promising fiction,''said Anthony M. Schulte, executive vice presi dent of Random House, ''and they also mean that things haven't chan ged as much in publishing as some of the doomsayers would ha ve people believe.'' Two books with Bill Adler as co-author have been published in the last two months, ''The I Love New York Diet'' (William Morrow), written with Bess Myerson and ''The Reagan Wit'' (Caroline House), written with his son, Bill Adler Jr. Mr. Adler's ''Inside Publishing'' (Bobbs-Merrill) will come out in May. As near as the 52-year-old author can figure, he has written or shared the writing of 58 books under his own name, plus 20 to 25 under the name Jay David. Mr. Adler's biggest selling book, ''The Kennedy Wit,'' a compilation of the wit and humor of John F. Kennedy, has sold more than 1.4 million copies. He has also written ''The Churchill Wit,'' ''The Stevenson Wit,'' ''The Washington Wits'' and ''The Presidential Wit.'' Over the years, Mr. Adler has been a program director for WNEW-TV, a television show host in California and an editor at Playboy Press. In recent years, when he wasn't writing his own books, he has been a literary agent and book packager. He packaged books by Pat Boone, Dick Clark and Art Linkletter, in each case hiring the writers who helped turn out the books. Among the authors he has represented are Ronald and Nancy Reagan before they went to the White House, Phil Donahue, Ralph Nader, Gene Autry, Rosemary Clooney and Howard Cosell. In addition to issuing the ''Inside Publishing'' book written by Mr. Adler, Bobbs-Merrill this spring will do four books for which he was the agent, including the autobiography of the actress Gale Storm and an examination of the Jesus cults by the entertainer-author Steve Allen. ''My wife, my secretary and I are involved in about 120 books a year, either as authors, packagers or agents,'' said Mr. Adler. His son, Bill, co-author of the Reagan book, is a foreign-policy lobbyist for Americans for Democratic Action, the liberal organization that finds scant hu mor in President Reagan's conservative policies. One of the biggest selling hard-cover books of all time, with sales of more than three million, was published privately 43 years ago, is generally not available in bookstores and does not identify authors or editors. The book is ''Alcoholics Anonymous,'' the bible of the self-help recovery program of the same name. After a first printing of 5,000 copies, it took 34 years for the book to reach the one million sales mark. But the second million was reached in five years and the third million in slightly more than three. Not a word has been changed in the first section of the book, which contains the group's statement of principles. But the second part, consisting of personal recovery stories, reflects the composition of the younger alcoholics coming into the program. And the price has been increased from $3.50 in 1939 to $5.65 today. Illustrations: photo of Bill Adler  ",

   "input": "Maeve Gilchrist 2019s musical memories go back to when she was a very young girl in Edinburgh, eager to join in with the adults who frequently jammed on traditional Irish and Scottish music in her house. Born to an Irish mother and a Scottish father, both of whom were active in the city 2019s folk music circles, little Maeve would grab a fiddle and pretend to play along. It wasn 2019t long before she knew her way around a different instrument, the harp. And it gave her a chance to join that musical conversation. 201cThere 2019s something to be said for folk music in general being the people 2019s music, 201d Gilchrist,29, says in a telephone interview from the road. 201cIt 2019s built to connect people. It 2019s a social musical form, and I love that. I think it 2019s wonderful how, if you get a different group of people together, the groove will be very different. There 2019s a magic to that to me. 201d Her informal exposure left Gilchrist so steeped in the folk music of her homeland, she recalls, that when she did enroll in the City of Edinburgh Music School when she was about 10, although the focus was on classical piano, her teachers were eager to support her extracurricular musical interests. When her interests broadened to include jazz, the school worked that into her curriculum. A full scholarship to Berklee College of Music brought her to the United States at 17, and she 2019s made it her business to take the harp into unfamiliar places ever since. She 2019s been a member of fiddle great Darol Anger 2019s group the Furies, recorded with artists ranging from Irish flutist Shannon Heaton to New York art-rockers My Brightest Diamond, and plays as a duo with dancer Nic Gareiss. She also teaches at Berklee. For a show at Arts at the Armory on Sunday, she 2019ll pair for the first time with Sam Amidon, the Vermont-born musician with a penchant for reimagining Appalachian folk music by coloring it with electronics, new music, and his own crooked aesthetic. The two have never played together, but seemed a good fit for the latest in an occasional series of concerts dubbed Revels FRINGE, produced by the organization best known for 201cChristmas Revels, 201d an annual production drawing from cultures around the world. FRINGE sees the organization act as 201ca kind of dating service, putting musicians together who we think are really fascinating, 201d artistic director Patrick Swanson says. A concert last year featured Galician bagpiper Carlos N 00fa 00f1ez Mu 00f1oz matched with guests including Gilchrist and jazz player Stan Strickland. In a sense, pushing the cl 00e0rsach, or Celtic harp, into new territory is part of the instrument 2019s history. It has a different mechanism for creating sharps and flats than the pedal harp commonly used in European classical music. And while there 2019s a rich repertoire of traditional Irish music centered on the instrument, Gilchrist says, in the realm of Scottish music, harp players have frequently borrowed tunes written for the fiddle or bagpipe. Harp can be a bit less portable than a fiddle, both in terms of carrying it around to impromptu jam sessions and finding common musical language with various styles of music. Gilchrist says that young harp players who receive only formal training can find themselves with a limited set of skills. 201cIt 2019s such a pleasing timbre that people are happy with very little, 201d she says. 201cYou could sit at the harp and run your finger up, and it would sound very beautiful. So it 2019s very easy to make pleasing sounds and get away with very little. Harp players spend so much time playing by themselves and practicing by themselves in a room, they get scared of creating music with other folks, and it takes a little bit of a leap of faith to start doing that. 201d She contrasts her own style with 201cthis kind of mist-cloud, ethereal harping 201d that may come to mind for many listeners when they think of the instrument. Amidon notes that he and Gilchrist have not yet met in person, but he is interested in her progressive views. 201cThe harp has a lot of possibilities as an instrument, 201d he writes in an e-mail, 201cand I 2019m super excited to hear what Maeve does, and for us to make some music together. I really don 2019t know where it 2019s all going to go! 201c Gilchrist says the combo has potential. 201cI suspect in many ways we come from quite similar musical places in regard to the strong presence of tradition in our music and the curiosity in contemporary sounds, 201d she says. As for her own genre-hopping, the variety suits her. 201cMy musical ADD has served me well, 201d she says. At: Center for the Arts at Tickets: $35, ages 35 and under $20. www.revels.org  ",

Economists expect retail sales to gain 0.5 percent after June's decline of 0.3 percent. There is also productivity and costs Tuesday , JOLTs job opening and turnover data Wednesday, and PPI inflation data, industrial production and consumer sentiment Friday. But there are also speeches by Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart on Monday and New York Fed President William Dudley. In the past week, Lockhart sent ripples through the markets when he said that in his view he saw no reason to hold off on a September rate hike. Dudley, part of the core of the Fed closest to Fed Chair Janet Yellen, speaks Wednesday in Rochester, New York, on work force development, but he is also taking questions. I think (stocks) will listen to the Fed speak after the payrolls data , said Art Cashin , director of floor operations at UBS. Cashin said the stock market also seems to be in a testing area , and it could be choppy as it sorts through the steep drop in oil. The S&P energy sector was down 3.5 percent for the week. West Texas Intermediate futures closed out the week at $43.87 per barrel , a decline of 6.9 percent and close to its March low of $42.03. Read MoreEarnings at Berkshire Hathaway fall 10% The S&P 500 finished the past week lower at 2077, off 1.2 percent, just above its 200-day moving average. The Dow was at 17,373, off 1.9 percent, and the Nasdaq was down 1.7 percent at 5,043 Paul LaRosa, chief market technician, agrees with Cashin that the S&P is testing support at 2,063. LaRosa said that if it breaks there, the next stop is 2, 039. It probably goes there , bounces and you're in that same choppy sideways market, he said. It seems every time we get to resistance , we lose steam and lose momentum, and every time we get to support, we bounce. At some point, that's going to change, and that's what we have to keep an eye on. We're watching these levels. We're treating it cautiously. Earnings are expected from Cisco , News Corp., Kraft Heinz and Alibaba, but the big rush of earnings news has slowed. Here's really the bottom line. Companies killed the expectations. We're beating by 5.3 percent for earnings season. If you look at what's normal over the very long run , it's like 3 percent, said Jonathon Golub , chief U.S. market strategist at RBC. Normally earnings estimates fall into the earnings seasons. This time they went up. Golub said earnings would have been far better if not for the steep decline in energy profits. Upstream companies' profits were down 74 percent , as WTI crude fell more than 40 percent year over year. Excluding energy , you're looking at growth rates in the low single digits. Even the areas where people said were horrible, like media, he said. Golub said while earnings are growing , revenues continue to struggle. The real story with earnings season is investors are not appreciating how strong it is. There's another sub-story. Their revenues literally are bad. They are just really anemic. The underlying trend is low single digits. What companies are doing , they're managing earnings really, really well and they're delivering, he said. Golub said he expects a couple of years' additional earnings upside due to cost management and buybacks , and that should help stock market gains. Read MoreThese heavily shorted stocks are tanking Golub said the market is less likely to respond to earnings in the coming week, as most companies have now reported. The market becomes less sensitive to the last 20 percent because it's going to look similar to companies that already reported , he said. Then you start turning to the economic data. The reality is this is August and the response to everything is going to be a lot more muted , unless there's some really big headline out of China. Golub said it's looking more like the Fed will raise rates in September. After Friday's July jobs report , futures markets immediately reflected a better-than-50 percent chance for September, from a roughly 47 percent chance. Markets had been pricing in December as most likely and each piece of data or Fed comment was able to shift the view slightly in the past week. I think from an investor's point of view , the Fed moving is going to be a good thing. We have zero interest rates. If the Fed is leaving it at zero, they're basically telling you they don't even think we can get to 25 basis points without upsetting the market and the economy. A move to 25 basis points is not someone taking the punch bowl away from the party. It's more like: 'We think you can do this on your own, son. We don't have to co-sign your lease anymore, ' Golub said. Hanson said consumer-related data will be important in the coming week , and the Fed will be watching all the data. You've got five more weeks of data , and there's plenty of things that could happen on the geopolitical front. Greece has to come to some agreement with their reconstituted troika. There's still risk out there from other sources, like the Middle East and China. The fiscal issue in the U.S. is going to come back on the fire, he said. There's a lot of things that contribute to uncertainty , and it's not unlike two years ago when the Fed was considering tapering QE3.  ",

But Trice says it wasn't an issue for her. By the time I got it out I had actually trained myself to eat only until I'm full , she says. And you're going through an education process while you're losing. The cost of the balloon also includes a 1-year nutritional support program so patients can have guidance after it's gone. Though the procedure sounds like a dream for people struggling to lose weight , not everyone is a candidate. Patients must have a body mass index of 30 to 40 (whereas a BMI of 35 to 40 is required for more invasive bariatric surgery). Previously we had nothing to offer this patient population , says the director of the Dr. Shawn Garber , who has already inserted 30 balloons. The procedure is for an in-between population: patients who don't weigh enough for gastric surgery, but who still struggle to maintain a healthy weight. They can expect to lose 20 to 70 lbs., says Garber. And side effects are limited. The first few days people have pretty severe nausea and vomiting , and maybe a little bit of abdominal pain from spasms of the stomach, he says. But after three days , most patients are feeling fine. Some of the less common risks include ulcers and the chance of the balloon bursting. It could pop , but as a safety mechanism we put a blue dye in the saline. If the balloon were to deflate, the blue dye would get absorbed into the bloodstream and turn the urine green, he says. That would be a sign to take it out 2013 before it migrates out of the stomach. Because the outpatient procedure requires no incision and only light sedation 2013 and takes just 12 to 15 minutes to perform 2013 Dr. Garber thinks it's a great option for obese patients with an upcoming wedding , or women looking to shed baby weight. In Trice's case, though, she was just happy to take control of her life. It's been a really good experience for me , she says , because I'm once again able to function without all the depression and things that go along with being overweight.  ",

We are defeating the hegemonic pretensions of the United States and today we have placed a new cornerstone for the freedom and unity of South America , Chavez told a crowded auditorium.

And then she opened her mouth, and tears fell from my eyes, 201d said director Jack O 2019Brien of Kerstin Anderson. When director Jack O 2019Brien was casting for the national tour of 201cThe Sound of Music, 201d he knew one thing: He didn 2019t want a star to play Maria, the iconic role immortalized by Julie Andrews and Mary Martin. 201cThe first thing she does is stand on the stage and sing 2018The Sound of Music, 2019 2019 2019 he explains. 201cThat song is the equivalent of 2018To be or not to be. 2019 It should be in the second act, but it happens in the first minute of the show. If it is sung by a Mary Martin or a Carrie Underwood or even Cher, you don 2019t pay attention to the song. But if you have never seen this girl, it forces you to listen. And this is Nannygate. I didn 2019t want a star. I wanted a baby sitter. 201d During casting, he saw a parade of actresses who looked like 201ccookie cutter versions of Julie Andrews. 201d But then Kerstin Anderson appeared. 201cShe sort of loped in, 201d O 2019Brien recalls. 201cShe is tall. She is rangy. She looked like a field hockey player. And then she opened her mouth, and tears fell from my eyes. 201d At the time, she had just finished her sophomore year at Pace University in New York; she is now taking time off to star in the touring production, which plays the Boston Opera House Tuesday through April 10. She says she went to the audition on a whim and was floored when she got the call from the casting director. 201cI was out to dinner, and I had to pack up the whole thing, 201d says Anderson, 21. 201cI couldn 2019t eat. It was earth-shattering. 201d O 2019Brien, a three-time Tony Award-winner, simply asked her to be herself. 201cI think I bring a youthful energy to the part and a slightly tomboyish nature, 201d she says. Anderson grew up in Burlington, Vt., about 45 minutes away from the Von Trapp Family Lodge, the place where the real-life Maria settled after escaping from Austria. She frequently went to the lodge while she was growing up, and she did her fair share of climbing mountains and fording streams. She remembers watching the 1965 film starring Andrews and Christopher Plummer. 201cMaria was iconically Julie Andrews in that movie, and I didn 2019t think anyone else could play her, 2019 2019 she says. 201cIt never crossed my mind. 201d But this production is decidedly not the movie. The producers gave O 2019Brien free rein, and he certainly didn 2019t want to re-create the original stage production of the Rodgers and Hammerstein classic, which he had seen as a college student in 1960. He also recently saw the musical in Russia. 201cIt was this enormous, nonsensical production, and I don 2019t speak Russian, 2019 2019 he says. 201cBut the girl playing Maria was so fresh and so immediate that I found myself deeply moved. I thought maybe this is a better show than I remembered. 201d He looked at the script and the score anew. 201cNo one has asked any questions of this sleeping beauty of a musical in 40 years, 201d he says. 201cIt hasn 2019t been anything but a decoration to hang around the neck of a star. 201d The first thing he noticed was the date and the place: Austria, 1938. Kristallnacht was just around the corner. Danger was in the air. O 2019Brien decided to revive the old chestnut by injecting a sense of urgency. He also lowered the ages of the actors by about 20 years. Maria and the Mother Abbess are closer in age, whereas in the film, the head nun is a stately senior who tsk tsks Maria 2019s clownish ways. In this production, they understand each other, almost as peers. Anderson is around the same age as the real Maria when she left the abbey to become the nanny for the children of Captain von Trapp, a man 25 years her senior. Ben Davis, who plays von Trapp, is 40. 201cMaria is the perfect second wife because she is so unlikely, 201d says O 2019Brien. In order to dust off the classic, O 2019Brien had the actors speak the lyrics, rather than sing them, for the first two weeks of rehearsal. 201cI didn 2019t want them to settle in on that score and let them drift through the performance like a picnic basket, 2019 2019 he says. For Anderson, the rehearsals were a young performer 2019s dream. 201cIt was like a four-week master class, 2019 2019 she says. O 2019Brien looked at all of the characters closely, as if they were new to the stage. Rolf, the young boy who courts 16-year-old Liesl and ultimately betrays her, is often seen as an evil character, but O 2019Brien sees him as a young mountain boy scrambling to get by in life. 201cWhat if he isn 2019t a baby Nazi, but that local kid that your mother didn 2019t want you to play with? 201d he asks. 201cHe is probably low class. He is probably a sexy little boy who has laid every girl in the village. 201d The film version is hardly sexy, even though dear old Dad does run off with the nanny. 201cDo you remember Christopher Plummer kissing Julie Andrews? 201d O 2019Brien asks. 201cIt wasn 2019t very hot. 201d Plummer, in fact, referred to the film as 201cThe Sound of Mucus. 201d But O 2019Brien says that the kiss in his production is steamy, and it frequently elicits ovations from the audience. That kiss takes place as the Nazis prepare to take over Austria, and O 2019Brien and Anderson say that fact looms over the entire production. 201cIt is the same beloved songs, the same beloved story, but Jack O 2019Brien is bringing out the pieces that people haven 2019t seen in years and years, 201d Anderson says. 201cIt has a really rich history, and with that comes urgency. 201d O 2019Brien says it wasn 2019t hard to put his stamp on the musical. 201cIt was an easy birth. Nobody felt like we were replicating something. Everyone felt that we were peeling away layers of varnish and finding something beneath them. 201d The sets by Douglas W. Schmidt contain the requisite elements 2014 the staircase, the abbey, the mountain 2014 but there aren 2019t endless drop curtains while the scenery is changed. And, of course, as we all know, the von Trapp family climbs over that mountain at the end. O 2019Brien hopes the final scene has a new resonance. 201cI kept reminding myself that this isn 2019t a musical with a happy ending, 2019 2019 he says. 201cThis is a scenario for survival. 201d Presented by Broadway in Boston.

   "input": "The ostrich-legged two-time Tony winner, who these days is successfully dishing one-liners (and making the supermarket tabloids) as co-star of the sitcom ''Cybill,'' has dropped by City Center to remind New York theater audiences just how much they miss her. Ms. Baranski is onstage for perhaps 10 minutes in the Encores concert revival of ''Promises, Promises,'' the pre-Anita Hill (1968) musical about sex in the work place. Ten minutes, however, is all that's needed for Ms. Baranski, playing a purposefully addled singles barfly who stalks her prey by insisting she's not a pickup, to create a few minor miracles with her eloquent eyebrows and the unexpected, line-bending timing of a jazz artist. Mind you, that Ms. Baranski walks away with the show is more an act of grand than petty larceny. First of all, she's up against the comic dynamo Martin Short, who works like a Trojan in the starring role, as well as such Broadway stalwarts as Dick Latessa and Terrence Mann. Moreover, it's hard to imagine this swinging period piece, which was hailed as the most thoroughly modern musical in years when it opened, receiving a more appetizingly polished staging than it's been given by its director and choreographer, Rob Marshall. Like last year's breakout Encores presentation of ''Chicago,'' this show, at least in terms of production values, seems ready to transfer to Broadway nearly as is. (With John Lee Beatty as its scenic consultant, it has the hard Lucite sparkle that the Roundabout revival of ''Company'' could have used more of.) But what Ms. Baranski achieves in her all too fleeting time onstage is the illusion that this musical is as fresh as a plate of four-star sushi. It isn't. Its pleasures, starting with Mr. Marshall's expert, ''Hullabaloo''-style dance numbers, are many. Yet there's an inescapable sense of sociological distance that pushes you back when you need to be drawn in. ''Promises, Promises,'' which runs through tomorrow, was a benchmark on Broadway. With a book adapted (ingeniously) by Neil Simon from ''The Apartment,'' Billy Wilder's mordant 1960 film about an ambitious schlmiel who finds success by lending his bachelor pad as a trysting place to randy executives, the show traded on the urbane prurience of such popular infidelity comedies as ''Any Wednesday.'' Though the work featured memorable dance sequences by a choreographer on the rise named Michael Bennett, what really set it apart was its score, written by the solid-gold pop composer Burt Bacharach with lyrics by Hal David. Mr. Bacharach introduced to Broadway not only the insistently rhythmic, commercial-jingle buoyancy of 1960's soft-core radio fare, but also a cinematic use of Teflon-smooth, offstage backup vocals (the sort of hypnotic ''doo-de-doo'' sounds that would soon invade elevators). Not surprisingly, the ever-sure Rob Fisher and his Coffee Club Orchestra replicate this sound with lush, time-machine exactitude. And Mr. Marshall and his corps de ballet match that spirit with marvelously precise renditions of the mechanically sexual dances that remind you that the liberated 60's were a little stiffer than anyone cares to remember. The overture is a trip, to use the language of the show's heyday, setting the tone visually as well as aurally with a bevy of daiquiri-cool go-go girls and angular men in skinny ties and C.I.A. suits. There's no attempt (as there was in the recent revival of ''How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying'') to disguise the sexism here. The women are, unequivocally, girls, expensive pleasure toys in silver Courreges-style minidresses well set off by Peggy Eisenhauer's disco-cum-office lighting. This climate of chilly lust, with its army of hubba-hubba businessmen (Eugene Levy of ''SCTV'' fame plays one of them), grows a tad tedious before the end of the first act. So does Mr. Bacharach's consciously repetitive score, which works better in the hedonistic choral numbers than in the soul-baring solos. Mr. Short has undeniable charm as the morally conflicted accountant who falls in love with Fran (Kerry O'Malley), the gaminish mistress of his womanizing (and married) boss (Mr. Mann). It's hard, though, to credit this subversive imp as a human doormat; you can feel a detached, demonic energy waiting to escape. When it does -- in both the giddy ''She Loves Me''-style solo, ''She Likes Basketball,'' and in his clown-like attempts to cheer up the depressed Fran -- he's delightful. The second act, which mostly takes place outside the barracuda tank of the office, is more engaging than the first. That's partly because it begins with Ms. Baranski, who immediately raises the evening's temperature. And Mr. Short and the winning Ms. O'Malley do very nicely indeed by the lower-key wistfulness of the show's best-known song, ''I'll Never Fall in Love Again.'' But while Mr. Simon's book remains a paradigm of agile construction, there's a groaning, antiquated quality to many of the sex jokes, just as there's a mod-paper-doll feeling about many of the characters. It's telling that the audience sees fit to hiss Mr. Mann's impassive cad, just as they would the mustache-twirling villain of a turn-of-the-century melodrama.

Get Data Sheet, Fortune 2019s technology newsletter. 201cThe rise of Marketplace lending has urged many commentators to highlight the potential disruption that such new business models may bring to traditional banking, 201d the report said. 201cOur research presents a different opinion and instead concludes that MPLs 201d 2014that is, marketplace lenders 2014 201ddo not currently have the competitive advantage needed to threaten this traditional banking model. 201d The paper doesn 2019t go into detail about individual companies, although it mentions several in passing like Prosper, OnDeck, and Lending Club among the new crop of lenders, and J.P. Morgan Chase jpm and Citigroup c in the incumbent camp. (It 2019s worth noting that Deloitte no doubt has big bank customers.) Adding support to the report 2019s conclusions, financial technology firms have hit turbulence in recent months. Prosper, the first peer-to-peer lending company in the U.S., said it would lay off 28% of its workers, Lending Club 2019s CEO departed under a huge cloud over its lending practices while its share price tumbled, and OnDeck 2019s stock price took a pummeling because of increasing doubts about its ability to find loan buyers. Meanwhile, big banks are trying to keep up with innovation by, among other things, experimenting with new technologies like the blockchain, the software underpinning Bitcoin, that could streamline their IT operations. Some banks like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup have partnered with companies like OnDeck and Lending Club, for example, to provide loans through their platforms. Lending has traditionally been a cash cow for commercial banks. Yet increased regulatory scrutiny and legacy IT costs are eating into entrenched players 2019 opportunities. Startups, on the other hand, are benefitting from low interest rates, low overhead for their technology infrastructure, and low risk associated with their peer-to-peer lending businesses. These factors have allowed them to enter the market as a compelling alternative loan provider for consumers, the report said. For more on loans, watch: Deloitte 2019s report sets out to answer a question: Is marketplace lending a temporary phenomenon? In other words, are the newcomers merely exploiting a set of lucky conditions that will vanish at some point? In fact, Deloitte predicted that the sector is not going away anytime soon. It foresees, however, that increased regulation and competition 201cmay squeeze returns, 201d or profits. The startups that stand the best chance of sticking around are niche players that focus on specific market segments, Deloitte said. For the most part though, these financial tech startups are 201cunlikely to pose a threat in the mass market, 201d it concluded. 201cThey may not fully disrupt the model, we do expect them to be a continued presence within the ever evolving banking landscape. 201d  ",

   "input": "Humor is attractive to men and women 2014 but not in the same way. The research shows women like men who make them laugh, and men like women who laugh at their jokes. Via Mating Intelligence Unleashed: The Role of the Mind in Sex, Dating, and Love: Recent research suggests that while both men and women say they like a 201cgood sense of humor 201d in a potential mate, they differ in what they mean by this phrase. Women tend to prefer men who make them laugh, whereas men tend to prefer women who laugh at their jokes. Consistent with this, Robert Provine analyzed more than 3000 singles ads and found that women were more likely to describe their good humor appreciation ability whereas men were more likely to offer good humor production ability. Why is humor sexy? Funny people are smart, and smart is sexy. Via Mating Intelligence Unleashed: The Role of the Mind in Sex, Dating, and Love: Gil Greengross and Geoffrey Miller found in a sample of 400 university students that general intelligence and verbal intelligence both predicted humor production ability (writing captions for cartoons), which in turn predicted lifetime number of sexual partners (a proxy of reproductive success). They found, however, that males showed higher average levels of humor production ability, which is consistent with the sexual selection perspective. From these results, Greengross argues that a sense of humor evolved at least partly through sexual selection as an intelligence indicator. So ladies can boost their attractiveness by chuckling a bit more. And guys, you can garner more attention by learning how to make women laugh. Via Mating Intelligence Unleashed: The Role of the Mind in Sex, Dating, and Love: Men in the 201chumor 201d condition received phone numbers from 42.9% of the female participants and were refused 57.1% of the time. In comparison, men in the 201cno humor 201d condition were refused 84.6% of the time and were only accepted 15.4% of the time. In other words, men who were observed as the humor producers of the group were nearly three times as likely to receive a phone number than those who were observed as laughing at a friend 2019s joke instead. Want to increase someone 2019s interest in you? Might be worthwhile to make sure they find out you 2019re interested in them. Via How to Make Someone Fall in Love With You in 90 Minutes or Less: Dr. Aron affirmed that the subjects 2019 expectation that the other person was going to like them had a huge effect. 201cIf you ask people about their experience of falling in love, over 90 percent will say that a major factor was discovering that the other person liked them, 201d according to Dr. Aron. This idea is affirmed by studying the effectiveness of 201cplaying hard to get. 201d What 2019s the best way to play that game? Establish that you 2019re hard to get in general 2014 but very enthusiastic about the person you 2019re with. Via Richard Wiseman 2019s excellent book 59 Seconds: Change Your Life in Under a Minute: As a result of the interviews, the researchers speculated that the best strategy would be to give a potential date the impression that in general you were hard to get (and therefore a scarce resource worth having) but really enthusiastic about him or her specifically. They tested this notion by using some of the same techniques 2026 and found overwhelming evidence to support their hypothesis. Random conversation with someone you 2019re interested in can be a bad idea. Why? What you talk about can matter 2014 a lot. Emotional, personal information exchange promotes powerful feelings of connection. Via Snoop: What Your Stuff Says About You: Arthur Aron, a psychologist at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, is interested in how people form romantic relationships, and he 2019s come up with an ingenious way of taking men and women who have never met before and making them feel close to one another. Given that he has just an hour or so to create the intimacy levels that typically take weeks, months, or years to form, he accelerated the getting-to-know-you process through a set of thirty-six questions crafted to take the participants rapidly from level one in McAdams 2019s system to level two. How effective is it? In under an hour it can create a connection stronger than a lifelong friendship. Via Click: The Magic of Instant Connections: What he found was striking. The intensity of the dialogue partners 2019 bond at the end of the forty-five-minute vulnerability interaction was rated as closer than the closest relationship in the lives of 30 percent of similar students. In other words, the instant connections were more powerful than many long-term, even lifelong relationships. (You can read the most effective things to discuss here.) That said, don 2019t get so nervous about your words that you can 2019t speak 2026 When a woman is very attracted to a man, whether his pickup line is good or not doesn 2019t matter at all. Via Mating Intelligence Unleashed: The Role of the Mind in Sex, Dating, and Love: When women are looking for a short-term fling, however, it may be a different story. One study conducted on college students found that women favored men for a short-term fling if they found the men attractive regardless of the content of their pickup lines. Conscientiousness is predictive of a number of very important positive elements in life. Agreeable, conscientious people make better spouses and parents 2014 but disagreeable, non-conscientious people have more sex partners. The former invest in quality, and it seems like the latter make up the difference in, well, volume. Looking to settle down? Check if that person has their ducks in a row, is organized and easy to get along with. That 2019s marriage material. Via Mating Intelligence Unleashed: The Role of the Mind in Sex, Dating, and Love: Nettle and Clegg reported that in a sample of 545 people, men (but not women) with low levels of agreeableness and conscientiousness tended to have a higher number of sexual partners. It has also been found cross-culturally, across 10 world regions, that low levels of agreeableness and conscientiousness are related to higher levels of sexual promiscuity and relationship infidelity, so there may be reproductive benefits to those on the low end of these traits. Research shows we don 2019t really fall in love with a person 2014 we fall in love with how we feel when we 2019re with them. This is best demonstrated by the concept of emotional contagion: we 2019re bad at telling what made us feel a certain way, but good about making associations. Feeling excited, stimulated and aroused is often associated with the people around us, even if they 2019re not the cause. This can be taken to extremes: having someone try to kill you can actually make you more attracted to them. Via The Heart of Social Psychology: A Backstage View of a Passionate Science: Those in the high-fear condition did show, for example, significantly more desire to kiss my confederate (one of the key questions) and wrote more romantic and sexual content into their stories. Looking at the details of these results, I found that the situation had generated, quite specifically, romantic attraction.

Via How to Make Someone Fall in Love With You in 90 Minutes or Less: Dr. Earl Naumann, author of Love at First Sight, interviewed and surveyed 1500 individuals of all races, religions, and backgrounds across America, and concluded that love at first sight is not a rare experience.

But largely those battles have fought fought in conference or court rooms, not Twitter. That all changed Thursday when Trump tweeted a photoshopped picture of Fox News host Megyn Kelly standing next to a woman in an niqab and Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Alsaud, one of the richest men in the world. Though bin Talal is an investor in Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., which owns Fox News, he owns just 7% of the company, while Chairman Rupert Murdoch controls the vast majority of the company 2019s voting shares, according to an SEC proxy filing. The tweet motivated bin Talal to fire back at Donald Trump, pointing out the fact that he helped bail Trump out of financial difficulties back in the 1990s. Bin Talal is referring to two deals that took place more than 20 years ago. The first was in 1991 when bin Talal bought a yacht once owned by Trump that he put up for sale during a period when his casinos were facing heavy financial pressure, and the second was a 1995 deal when bin Talal bought a stake in Trump 2019s Plaza Hotel. Sky-high Manhattan real estate prices means that Trump is nowhere near the financial distress he found himself in in the early 1990s. But bin Talal 2019s tweets suggest that at least some of the global power elite that Trump rubs elbows with are not happy with the magnates fiery rhetoric.

   "input": "QUETTA, Pakistan, Oct. 2 2014 With nothing more than a telephone and a fax machine, Tarir Khan transfers money almost anywhere in the world 2014 no questions asked, no names used and no trail for law enforcement to follow. Mr. Khan is a small cog in a far- reaching network of informal banking known as hawala, the Arabic word for trust. Although it is illegal in most countries, including here in Pakistan, authorities estimate that billions of dollars flow unseen by regulators through the hawala system worldwide. A senior government official in Pakistan said law enforcement authorities were certain that Osama bin Laden's network used hawala to transfer money to agents outside Afghanistan, along with conventional means. But the nature of hawala will make tracking those particular exchanges almost impossible. In the Kandahari bazaar here, many hawala dealers are concentrated in a five-story concrete building that resembles a bunker, its interior dark and its offices lighted by dim bulbs. Outside, donkey-drawn carts vie for space with Toyota Land Cruisers, and three-wheel motorized rickshaws dodge bangled buses and pedestrians. The absence of women, save a couple of beggars, is striking. In Pakistan and Afghanistan, money business is men's business. Anyone can walk into a hawala shop in Quetta or a thousand other cities in southern Asia, put down a stack of cash and ask that the sum be transferred to a recipient in another country. Mr. Khan and his associate, found sitting cross-legged on the floor of their sparse office and sipping tea, keep transactions in a brown notebook on Mr. Khan's desk. When he receives a telephone call or a fax to confirm that money has been picked up elsewhere in the world, the relevant page is torn out of the notebook. Even the new scrutiny prompted by the terror attacks on Sept. 11 is highly unlikely to disclose all the details of how Mr. bin Laden's money moves through the ancient system. Mr. Khan, for one, refuses to divulge the cities where he has associates, saying he fears the authorities. This system is made for transferring enough money to get a pilot's license or make a deposit on an apartment without raising an eyebrow , Prof. Nikos Passas , an expert on transnational crime at Temple University and a consultant to government agencies, said in a telephone interview. Finance Minister Shaukut Aziz, a former executive vice president of Citibank in New York, said $2 billion to $5 billion moved through the hawala system annually in Pakistan, more than the amount of foreign transfers through the country's banking system. Pakistan is trying to draft laws to regulate the industry. But for now it thrives illegally in places like the Kandahari bazaar. A United States Treasury Department study identified hawala as the principal means of money laundering from drug trafficking and other crimes in Pakistan. The report said Pakistan, India and Dubai on the Persian Gulf form the hawala triangle to move money secretly worldwide. In hawala , sums large and small are sent halfway around the world on a handshake and a code word. Records of transactions are kept just until the deal is completed. Then they are destroyed. No cash moves across a border or through an electronic transfer system, the places where authorities are most likely to spot or record the transaction. The sender does not have to provide his name or identify the recipient. Instead, he is given a code word, which is all the recipient needs to pick up the same amount of cash from an associate of the original trader. The transaction can occur in the time it takes to make a couple of phone calls or send a fax. The system was in place long before Western banking. The ancient Chinese used a similar method called flying money , or fei qian. Arab traders used it as a means of avoiding robbery along the Silk Road. Millions of Pakistanis , Indians, Filipinos and other people from southern Asia working in foreign countries use the system to send money home to relatives. They don't feel comfortable walking into a bank , Mr. Aziz said in an interview. It's very dangerous to talk about this , because it is illegal, Mr. Khan , who arrived in Quetta from Afghanistan many years ago, said this afternoon as a colleague shook his head and told him to keep quiet. I can't tell you much. Trust , he said, is the essential quality of a hawala trader. Most of his customers are from the same part of Afghanistan. So there is an innate sense of trust. He said transfers were usually sent among family members and involved a few hundred dollars. Sometimes transactions are for as little as $50. He provides a five-digit code word, a letter and four numbers, that the recipient takes to one of Mr. Khan's associates as far away as the United States, Germany or Russia. The same associates accept money for transfer to relatives in Quetta. They tell the code word , and we hand over the money, he said. Then we tear up the records on both ends. Most hawala merchants charge a small commission , usually $5 for transfers up to $500 and $10 for up to $1,000. Their main profit comes from currency fluctuations and extra fees for moving money for big clients. The system is used for far larger sums, often by drug traffickers, corrupt politicians and black market traders, according to local experts and law enforcement. The drug dealers , the politicians who get kickbacks and others with black money use this system, said Kamran Mumtaz , editor of The Daily Mashriq, a newspaper in Quetta. Authorities have found evidence that hawala has been used for payments by smuggling rings and militant groups in the disputed territory of Kashmir and the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka, Professor Passas said. This is the most convenient , common and cheapest system of moving money, he said. It is also one of the most difficult to track.  ",

   "input": "THE arraignment of the notorious New York landlord Steven Croman last month was a rare bit of good news for the tenants in his buildings, many of whom have said they have endured hazardous conditions designed to force them out of their homes. Mr. Croman was charged with 20 felonies related to his rental income (he has pleaded not guilty), and faces a civil suit accusing him of using illegal means to force tenants out of their rent-stabilized apartments, in order to renovate them and find new tenants to pay market rates. Unfortunately, Mr. Croman 2019s alleged approach to emptying buildings is not at all uncommon. Altering or destroying a building in order to make it unsafe is the method of choice for many property owners operating in some of the city 2019s most rapidly changing neighborhoods. When tenants can no longer cope with the danger, they often reach out to city agencies for help, which plays right into the property owner 2019s hand: A city inspector pays a visit, observes the hazards and issues an order to vacate. Tenants then have mere hours to leave their homes, and once they vacate an apartment it is nearly impossible for them to get back in. Even when housing court disputes are settled and a judge finds a property owner responsible for illegal construction, such decisions rarely involve criminal charges. Occasionally, city and state governments are able to work in concert to arrest a bad actor. But the number of bad actors far exceed the arrests. Brooklyn, which is undergoing an aggressive wave of gentrification, is rife with property owners who engage in these practices with impunity. Specific examples are easy to come by. In 2014, for instance, tenants of the seven-unit building at 94 Franklin Avenue, which is owned by the Tiferes Yehuda Family Trust, were told that construction would soon take place in the backyard. When tenants asked the building manager about it, she explained that a new playground was in the works. Soon construction workers showed up and threw away tenants 2019 belongings 2014 toys, grills, patio furniture 2014 without warning. Jackhammering began and was so severe that exterior windows shattered and dust seeped into tenants 2019 homes, affecting an asthmatic child living inside. The dust, noise and debris became part of daily life for the next year. In court affidavits, one tenant says that when she called the building manager about the situation, she denied that construction was taking place. And the work continued. A crew began putting up a wall just a few inches from the back of the building. The tenants called 311, and the Department of Buildings sent over an inspector. The work continued, and tenants called 311 again. When an inspector saw that the construction was eliminating egress and cutting off natural light, a stop work order and a vacate order were issued. The tenants were given hours to leave. That was July 2015. The work continued and five months later, in December, another stop work order was issued. Since evacuating nearly a year ago, the tenants have had limited access to their apartments and had to arrange visits through the manager. Inside, they discovered water damage, a rat infestation and rotting floors. In court documents, lawyers for the property owner say that the manager has since been replaced and that repairs have been made, and continue to be made, to lift the vacate order. The Department of Buildings has brought criminal actions against the owners and the city is seeking to appoint an administrator to the building. Meanwhile, all of the tenants are still displaced with no guarantees that they will be able to move back into their homes. One family has entered the shelter system. The case at 172 North Eighth Street, an eight-unit building in Williamsburg, is another example. In June 2009, tenants in the rent-stabilized apartments were ordered to vacate because of an illegal excavation of the basement by the building 2019s owner, listed publicly as 172 Realty Capital, that compromised the structural integrity of the building. The building had 76 open violations from the city, including 34 labeled 201cimmediately hazardous. 201d Repairs were reportedly done and the order was lifted. Some tenants returned to find no running water, no electricity and no functioning sewage. Then, two cellar walls were found to have collapsed. Another vacate order was issued, forcing the tenants out yet again.  ",

   "input": "Republicans in the first four states to weigh in on the GOP presidential nomination are not standing lockstep against gay marriage and largely support measures that protect LGBT people from discrimination, according to a series of GOP polls obtained by TIME. Those fast-shifting attitudes could offer an opportunity for the Republicans presidential contenders to moderate their stances and better position themselves for a head-to-head contest against the Democratic nominee in 2016. By and large, Americans have shifted toward acceptance of gays marrying, and most candidates reflected that view in reacting to last week 2019s Supreme Court ruling that expanded marriage to same-sex couples nationwide. While a few candidates reacted with fiery statements 2014former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee called for civil disobedience and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker called for states to pass a constitutional amendment to undo the ruling 2014likely Republican primary voters greeted it with a collective shrug. In New Hampshire, 55% of likely Republican primary voters said they would accept the Supreme Court 2019s ruling as the law of the land. In Iowa and Nevada, 46% of Republicans said they agreed. Forty-one percent of Republicans in South Carolina, which is the most conservative of the first four states, said they could accept the court 2019s ruling. Of course, that means the majority in three of the first four states remain opposed to same-sex marriage. But the acceptance is still a remarkable development, with roughly half of Republicans willing to move past the same question that drove scores of voters to cast ballots against gay marriage in recent elections. Nationally, the poll found 39% of Republicans support gay marriage and, when the question is asked differently, 43% of Republicans say same-sex couples should have the same rights as straight couples. Only 33% of Republicans in the national survey would back an amendment to the Constitution to ban same-sex marriages in the states. That is perhaps why some Republicans did not react strongly to the Supreme Court ruling. 201cWhile we have differences, it is time for us to move forward together respectfully and as one people, 201d Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said Americans should 201clove our neighbor and respect others, including those making lifetime commitments. 201d Added Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida: 201cWhile I disagree with this decision, we live in a republic and must abide by the law. 201d None embraced same-sex marriage. The next question, which is less clear among the Republican hopefuls, is anti-discrimination legislation to finish what the Supreme Court started. While the court ruled that gays and lesbians have the right to wed, many Americans live in places where same-sex couples can face legalized discrimination when it comes to housing, employment or finances. In Congress, moves are underway to introduce a comprehensive anti-discrimination bill in the coming weeks. According to the same polls, such protections are popular among Republicans 2014as long as there are provisions that Americans would not have to betray their religious convictions. Nationally, 59% of Republican voters say there should be laws banning discrimination against gays and lesbians in employment, housing, credit, education and public accommodations, such as hotel stays or restaurant service. Among Republican millennials 2014young voters 2014that number reaches 79% support. Twenty-three percent of Republicans surveyed said they would be more likely to support a candidate who endorses a non-discrimination bill. In the crucial first four states, a majority of Republican voters support anti-discrimination laws as long as there were provisions that would allow, say, a Southern Baptist Church to refuse to marry a same-sex couple. A broad anti-discrimination proposal would have the backing of 67% of New Hampshire Republicans and 61% in Nevada. The poll results, which are set to be released on Friday, were provided early to TIME. The study was conducted by a panel of respected GOP pollsters who have advised presidential candidates and their campaigns: Alex Gage (Mitt Romney), Jan van Lohuizen (George W. Bush) and Adam Geller (Chris Christie), as well as House Republicans 2019 survey mavens Brock McCleary and Robert Jones. The poll was funded by Project Right Side, an organization founded by openly gay former Republican National Committee Chairman Ken Mehlman. The other sponsor was the American Unity Fund, a project backed by billionaire investor Paul Singer, who publicly supports gay rights. Billionaires Seth Klarman, a Republican donor, and Dan Loeb, a Democratic donor, are backers of the groups, as well. The national survey interviewed 2,000 voters, including 798 Republicans or Republican-leaning voters. Separately, the pollsters also asked 500 registered voters in each of the early nominating states their opinion, including 205 likely Republicans in Iowa, 216 likely Republican in New Hampshire, 232 likely Republicans in South Carolina and 194 likely Republicans in Nevada. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.2 percentage points; it is 4.4 percentage points for the state-specific samples.

Sunday night's hour of the HBO drama marked the return of Sandor (The Hound) Clegane, last seen left for dead after a beating from Brienne of Tarth in Season 4. He was found by a religious man, head of a peaceful tribe and it seemed for a brief moment The Hound was turning away from his past of violence and hate. However, at the episode's end, he's forced back into his old ways after a group of vagabonds murdered his peaceful group. Meanwhile, Sansa, Jon Snow and Ser Davos were working to rally support to take back Winterfell and save the youngest of the Stark siblings, Rickon. The remaining Wildlings after some convincing from Tormund and Jon have promised to fight alongside the Starks in their battle against the Boltons. Viewers were then granted a fun exchange between the 10-year-old Lady Mormont, the head of the Bear Island, and the Northern posse. 2018Game of Thrones 2019 Season 6, Episode 6 recap Both Sansa and Jon discuss their connections to House Mormont, but in the end though, it's Davos who convinced the young leader to lend her support. The victory is short-lived, however. The young leader promises only 62 men, and the group was unable to get support from House Glover. In King's Landing, religion continues to rule. Lady Oleanna scolded her granddaughter for siding with the faith militant but Magaery revealed she's only playing the game. At the end of their exchange, the Queen handed her grandmother a drawing of a flower, their house sigil, a symbol of her ever-strong allegiance to her family and her house. Arya, last week after saving Lady Crane, seemed back to her old self, needle in hand. She had booked passage back to Westeros but the Waif stabbed her repeatedly before she could escape Braavos. Arya managed to get away with her life, but only barely. At the episode's close she was left wandering the streets, desperately trying to hold in the blood seeping out of her wounds. Jamie this week made his way to Riverrun with the goal of reclaiming the castle on behalf of the Freys and quelling a potential rebellion in the North. The Blackfish had no interest in leaving his home peacefully however. He offered no concession to the Lannister. The most exciting aspect of this plot line is the potential reunion between Jamie and former travel-buddy Brienne. While they're almost-friendship was fun to watch, should they reunite it will be on different sides of the battlefield. A look at how Daenerys Targaryen could end up a 2018GoT 2019 villain The Broken Man offered viewers a unique perspective on the game of thrones. The constant strategy and networking in this episode was a nice change of pace after five seasons of constant violence. The tension-filled peace will be short-lived , though 2014 this is the game of thrones after all.  ",

   "input": "I recently got back from a 10-day trip to Cuba. And during those days I gained some insight into what thousands of Americans are going to find when they leave their luxury hotels and lavish supermarkets and spend significant amounts of money to travel to an island hobbled by embargo and food shortages. In a nutshell, it 2019s going to be a huge, huge mess. But (probably!) worth it, particularly for the adventurous and culinarily unambitious. The trip I went on was a 201cpeople-to-people 201d educational group voyage, in compliance with U.S. State Department guidelines. I like to think of it as the last government trip to Cuba, before normalized tourism takes hold. The group spent most of its time in Havana, but we also visited Vi 00f1ales in the west and Trinidad on the Caribbean coast. Cuba is a fascinating and outrageously photogenic place. Here 2019s what I saw. The food is bad, but the plumbing is worse Part of traveling is pretending that the food everywhere you go is some of the best in the world. But not everywhere can be above average on the culinary front. Mince pie and fermented shark are indigenous to somewhere, after all. Cuban cuisine is based on imported rice, black beans, government issue cheese product #1 and enough sugar to give you diabetes in a week. It tastes about as good as it sounds. I 2019m not blaming Cuba for this. The country is desperately poor, the embargo means nothing is quite fresh, and restaurants have only been legal since 2013. That 2019s hardly enough time to make a proper sauce, let alone develop a restaurant scene. But that doesn 2019t stop travel writers from pretending the food is good. The most recent example of this was The New York Times 2019 36 Hours in Havana piece, which fawned over all of the 201chot 201d new restaurants in city. The article came out while I was there, so I made a point of going to as many restaurants as I could in search of a decent meal. They were perfectly lovely restaurants with attentive service, hip decor and food that would make a Red Lobster manager blush. The one upshot to Cuban food is you don 2019t find yourself overeating, which is good since properly functioning flush toilets are almost unheard of. Labor is free and capital is dear Eighty percent of Cuba 2019s workforce is employed directly by the state. For them, the official wage is 500 Cuban pesos per month 2014 or about $20. Professionals in sectors facing an acute labor shortage make a bit more: doctors earn three times the standard wage. But however you slice it, the average salary is extremely low relative other countries in the hemisphere. Sure, there 2019s a big safety net: the government provides free housing, healthcare, and education. The ration book provides for about 15 days of food per month, as well as staples like soap and cooking oil. (beyond that, food is subsidized.) So we 2019re not exactly talking about World Bank $1.25 a day levels of poverty, but buying power in the country is limited. And to make matters worse, anything that can 2019t be produced on the island needs to be imported, often via the black market thanks to the embargo, leading to higher than average prices for clothes, electronics, building materials, and the vast majority of consumer goods. Internet access is $2 per hour, texts 5 cents per message. The high cost of goods and low cost of work lead to labor practices that would seem insane anywhere else. Jobs like plowing fields and weaving textiles that have been mechanized for decades in the rest of the world are done by hand in Cuba 2014 sometimes by people with college degrees. Productivity is handicapped because employers (read: the state) are also short on cash. Cuba imports all its energy and most of its food, leaving very little to put towards machines that might improve efficiency. Cuba 2019s 201cmodern 201d infrastructure and equipment dates from the end of the Soviet Era, and much of it from before the revolution (see: classic cars). The result is a country where a full-time employee might cost $100 a month in the embryonic private sector, but a five-year old Kia runs $100,000. Old cars were kind of terrible The reason we don 2019t drive 55 Chevys around America anymore is that they were terrible cars. On every measure aside from sheer bulk, classic cars were drastically worse than what we drive today. They were slow; got terrible fuel economy, and were almost-certain-deathtraps in any sort of accident. Perhaps worst of all: they lack catalytic converters. Only 5% of Cubans own private cars, and a not all of those are 55 2019 Chevrolets. But even the small number of old cars tooling around Havana 2019s empty highways spew so much particulate that the air in New York 2019s Times Square seems fresh and clean by comparison. Cuban agriculture is 100% organic and a total catastrophe In college, I took a course about Cuban agricultural systems that in retrospect was nothing more than an excuse to get around hyper-strict Bush-era travel bans. I didn 2019t go on the Cuba trip then (it involved mandatory farm work), but I remember the thesis quite clearly: It was that Cuba shows how a whole country can be not only GMO free, but also free of pesticides and fertilizer. Michael Pollan 2019s wet dream. If Cuba is the example, we 2019re all going to starve. While it 2019s true that all the food produced in Cuba is totally organic, the agricultural system is a complete shambles. Nobody can afford a tractor, let alone fertilizer or pesticides. The revolution capped farms at 40 acres making them too small to effectively mechanize even if you could afford machines. People pick insects off tobacco leaves by hand and plow fields with donkeys. Some 14% of the country is stuck working in agriculture, which contributes just 4% of GDP and doesn 2019t produce nearly enough to feed everyone. More than 80% of food has to be imported. All of the buildings are falling down One of the most striking things about Communist Cuba is how little communist architecture there is. There is the revolutionary square 2014 a vast parking lot with a scattering of dumpy post war buildings around it. But aside from that, most of the built environment dates from a several decade timespan around the turn of the 19th century. There are very few of the concrete apartment blocks that blanket Eastern Europe. It makes for a lovely old-world feel on the surface, but the problem with a building stock that 2019s over 100 years old and hasn 2019t seen a drop of paint since 1989 is that buildings are starting to fall apart 2014 everywhere, and at the same time. According to one government architect, Havana sees four buildings collapse per-day. Apartments are privately owned (sales are restricted and only became legal at all in the past few years), but ownership of the buildings is ambiguous. A gallon of paint costs a month 2019s salary. Don 2019t even think about new appliances. The parts of the old city that haven 2019t already fallen down look as though they soon might. One sliver of hope is the recent relaxation of remittance rules by the Obama administration. Some buildings are being renovated 2014 which could suggest the owners have relatives in Miami. Cuba seems to realize it 2019s time to increase income inequality When nearly every job pays 500 Cuban pesos ($20) a month, it 2019s really hard to get people to fill jobs that are grueling or require years of training. The result is labor shortages and weird labor distribution, a problem exacerbated by two factors: 1: The United State 2019s policy of open immigration from Cuba siphons off some of the wealthiest, ablest, and most educated workers to the U.S. 2: Extraordinarily low state wages and the premium on foreign currency makes tourism-related jobs, where you can earn a tip, the most desireable in the country. The result is that cab drivers have Ph D.s and are some of the richest people around.We met an economist from a university in the country who explained some of the recent reforms aimed at addressing this crisis. Farmers are now allowed to sell 10% of their harvest to private parties (the remaining 90% is sold to central government). Wages for doctors were tripled, and requirements to become a teacher have been drastically lowered (Cuba 2019s great educational system is talked about exclusively in the past tense). There 2019s no racism and Cuba 2019s a democracy, technically I 2019m not sure if it 2019s the repressive government or the lack of Internet access, but a lot of Cubans come across as a particularly by-the-book, party-line lot. We were told by several different people that despite a history of slave plantations, racism wasn 2019t an issue at all in Cuba. The Revolution technically abolished it in 1959! How glorious. Why didn 2019t we try that, comrade? We heard similar double speak about elections and press freedom. If there 2019s an election commission, the elections must be free and fair. The law says so! Everyone in Cuba desperately wants the embargo lifted As a tool of regime change, the American trade embargo has been a complete failure. The Castro government is now the longest serving in the world. But as an exercise in immiserating a small country, it has been a smashing success. Turns out that locking 11.5 million people out of the world economy does, in fact, result in radically higher prices, crumbling infrastructure and widespread human suffering. Let 2019s not pretend the embargo is some great principled position. We count the Saudis among our closest allies and we resumed trade with China 2014 an opening that has helped lift 500 million people out of poverty (while benefiting western consumers too!). The difference between China and Cuba is the Guomindang fled to Taiwan when they lost the revolution. Batista supporters went to Miami, where they have been enormously successful at advancing grudge politics against the revolutionaries ever since. Cuba relations are something of a historical curiosity for most Americans, but for Cubans they are the only thing that matters. Almost everyone you encountered 2014 save for the employees at the Hotel Nacional de Cuba, who set the global standard for surly hotel staff 2014 were genuinely excited to find out we were Americans. People would assume we were Canadian, we 2019d correct them, and their face would light up with joy. Cab drivers would give us a high five. Street merchants would beam and ask how we liked Cuba. It 2019s not just that Americans tip better than our neighbors to the north, but that our presence means the embargo might end soon. Unfortunately, I doubt it will. And they think your concern about McDonald 2019s is patronizing nonsense The Cuban culture that we romanticize today developed during a period when the country was utterly and completely dominated by American companies. The idea that the arrival of McDonald 2019s will somehow suffocate a culture that survived United Fruit, the Batista regime, the mafia, and a communist command economy strains credulity, to say the least. Some of the state officials we talked to found the idea patronizing. Cuba has more than enough crumbling commercial real estate to go around and the Cuban people seem to desperately want access to the same goods and services everyone else in the world enjoys. I personally find dilapidated buildings and ration centers photogenic, but pretty much everyone would be better off with a McDonald 2019s there instead. Plus, Cuban breakfast could really benefit from the introduction of the McMuffin. Most of the embargo is rigorously enforced, but some aspects are total bullshit Thanks to Cuban Expat Lobby, the U.S. embargo of Cuba has been more ruthlessly enforced than any other trade sanctions we 2019ve imposed, but even so, the part about air travel seems to be kind of bullshit. American air carriers aren 2019t allowed to fly to Cuba 2014 you have to take a special charter from one of a handful of approved cities. The thing is, my charter was an American Airlines plane with an American Airlines Crew that offered American Airlines frequent flier miles for a trip to a country American Airlines is ostensibly not allowed to fly to.

She 2019s America 2019s favorite beret-wearing former intern, whose very name has become a synonym for a sex act she eagerly performed on her knees, a dame who rocketed to fame for failing to dry-clean a blue dress stained with the seed of the then-leader of the free world. Now, Lewinsky,40, wants our pity and, perhaps, a job she can perform while sitting upright. And 2014 drum roll, please 2014 she doesn 2019t blame former President Bill Clinton, the alpha male before whom she famously knelt. The pair 2019s sexploits took place in and around the Oval Office, including in a bathroom and a hallway, in 1995, when Lewinsky was a willing pup of 22. This brought about Clinton 2019s impeachment 2014 although the Senate acquitted him of lying under oath and obstruction of justice in 1999 2014 and caused strife in his marriage. Ultimately, public sympathy may help catapult his wife, Hillary Clinton, to the presidency in 2016. As for Lewinsky, she will not be ignored. Photo: Sam Jones exclusively for Vanity FairAfter a decade of precious near-silence 2014 after she blabbed to Barbara Walters, after her handbag company failed, after a pitchwoman stint for Jenny Craig diets, after she hosted a dating reality-TV series that lasted five episodes on Fox TV, authorized a biography, participated in a self-serving HBO TV documentary and graduated from the London School of Economics with a master 2019s degree in social psychology 2014 Lewinsky has hunted unsuccessfully for a job from New York to Los Angeles to Portland, Ore. Now, she wants a payday. In an exasperatingly tone-deaf piece in Vanity Fair, set to be released digitally Thursday and hit newsstands May 13, she gave the scoundrel Bill Clinton a free pass for romping with her in a particularly degrading fashion. In excerpts released on the magazine 2019s website and in a press release, she wrote, 201cSure, my boss took advantage of me. 2019 2019 Ya think? 201cBut I will always remain firm on this point: It was a consensual relationship. 2019 2019 201cIt seems that nothing will stop Lewinsky from making a big Lewinsky of herself. 201d In an egregiously offensive plea for understanding, Lewinsky compared her situation to that of cyberbullying victim Tyler Clementi, the 18-year-old New Jersey college freshman who jumped off the George Washington Bridge in 2010, killing himself. This after his roommate set up a webcam and watched with friends as Clementi kissed another man. What an imbecile. Lewinsky potentially wounded Clementi 2019s family, folks who 2019ve already suffered so much. And she wrote that she didn 2019t even attempt suicide! Lewinsky just thought about it. Her mom feared for her life, too. It seems that nothing will stop Lewinsky from making a big Lewinsky of herself. She got in a good dig at Hillary Clinton, who, according to the files of her late pal Diane Blair, once called Lewinsky a 201cnarcissistic loony toon 2019 2019 and partly blamed herself for her hubby 2019s cheating ways. Lewinsky found Hillary 2019s impulse to blame the women in her husband 2019s life 201ctroubling. 201d The ex-intern faulted a long list of people for the 201cabuse 2019 2019 she said she suffered after the Clinton scandal became public 2014 201cthe Clinton administration, the special prosecutor 2019s minions, the political operatives on both sides of the aisle and the media. 2019 2019 Lewinsky, I 2019d recommend that you use your special talents to forge an exciting new career in whatever it is you do best.

   "input": "How will future historians explain it? How will they possibly explain why President George W. Bush decided to ignore the energy crisis staring us in the face and chose instead to spend all his electoral capital on a futile effort to undo the New Deal, by partially privatizing Social Security? We are, quite simply, witnessing one of the greatest examples of misplaced priorities in the history of the U.S. presidency. Ah , Friedman, but you overstate the case. No , I understate it. Look at the opportunities our country is missing -- and the risks we are assuming -- by having a president and vice president who refuse to lift a finger to put together a geo-green strategy that would marry geopolitics , energy policy and environmentalism. By doing nothing to lower U.S. oil consumption, we are financing both sides in the war on terrorism and strengthening the worst governments in the world. That is, we are financing the U.S. military with our tax dollars and we are financing the jihadists -- and the Saudi, Sudanese and Iranian mosques and charities that support them -- through our gasoline purchases. The oil boom is also entrenching the autocrats in Russia and Venezuela, which is becoming Castro's Cuba with oil. By doing nothing to reduce U.S. oil consumption we are also setting up a global competition with China for energy resources, including right on our doorstep in Canada and Venezuela. Don't kid yourself: China's foreign policy today is very simple -- holding on to Taiwan and looking for oil. Finally, by doing nothing to reduce U.S. oil consumption we are only hastening the climate change crisis, and the Bush officials who scoff at the science around this should hang their heads in shame. And it is only going to get worse the longer we do nothing. Wired magazine did an excellent piece in its April issue about hybrid cars, which get 40 to 50 miles to the gallon with very low emissions. One paragraph jumped out at me: Right now , there are about 800 million cars in active use. By 2050, as cars become ubiquitous in China and India, it'll be 3.25 billion. That increase represents an almost unimaginable threat to our environment. Quadruple the cars means quadruple the carbon dioxide emissions -- unless cleaner, less gas-hungry vehicles become the norm. All the elements of what I like to call a geo-green strategy are known: We need a gasoline tax that would keep pump prices fixed at $4 a gallon , even if crude oil prices go down. At $4 a gallon (premium gasoline averages about $6 a gallon in Europe), we could change the car-buying habits of a large segment of the U.S. public, which would make it profitable for the car companies to convert more of their fleets to hybrid or ethanol engines, which over time could sharply reduce our oil consumption. We need to start building nuclear power plants again. The new nuclear technology is safer and cleaner than ever. The risks of climate change by continuing to rely on hydrocarbons are much greater than the risks of nuclear power , said Peter Schwartz , chairman of Global Business Network, a leading energy and strategy consulting firm. Climate change is real and it poses a civilizational threat that [could] transform the carrying capacity of the entire planet. And we need some kind of carbon tax that would move more industries from coal to wind , hydro and solar power, or other, cleaner fuels. The revenue from these taxes would go to pay down the deficit and the reduction in oil imports would help to strengthen the dollar and defuse competition for energy with China. It's smart geopolitics. It's smart fiscal policy. It is smart climate policy. Most of all -- it's smart politics! Even evangelicals are speaking out about our need to protect God's green earth. The Republican Party is much greener than George Bush or Dick Cheney , remarked Mr. Schwartz. There is now a near convergence of support on the environmental issue. Look at how popular [Arnold] Schwarzenegger , a green Republican, is becoming because of what he has done on the environment in California. Imagine if George Bush declared that he was getting rid of his limousine for an armor-plated Ford Escape hybrid , adopting a geo-green strategy and building an alliance of neocons, evangelicals and greens to sustain it. His popularity at home -- and abroad -- would soar. The country is dying to be led on this. Instead, he prefers to squander his personal energy trying to take apart the New Deal and throwing red meat to right-to-life fanatics. What a waste of a presidency.

I am the grandson of immigrants who came to America in search of freedom from Czarist oppression. I am a historian well aware of the pain and suffering inflicted on countless generations of Jews who were expelled from countries they had long called home and denied entry to other nations because of their religion.

The lesson of the Exodus, taught again and again by the prophets of the Bible, is that we all have responsibilities to add justice and compassion to God 2019s world.

Wednesday is the third day of Hanukkah, a holiday which 2014more than any other on the Jewish calendar 2014celebrates religious freedom. Antiochus Epiphanes, who promulgated the decrees against Jews that led to the Maccabean revolt in 165 BCE, was neither the first tyrant nor the last to argue that religious difference could not be tolerated. Jews are only one among many religious and ethnic minorities to have suffered from the argument that all members of the community should be punished for the misdeeds of a few, or that their religion itself constituted a threat to the wellbeing of the nation or the world. Words matter greatly, according to Jewish tradition, and must be carefully weighed. Judaism 2019s sages taught that three sins are so grave they are not only punished in this world, but bar entry to the world to come: idol-worship, forbidden sexual relations, and murder 2014 201cand wicked speech is equal to all of them. 201d This holds true even for the weakest form of slanderous speech, for it destroys the reputation of those against whom it is deployed. We 2019ve all seen words translated all too quickly into violence; Jews and many others have learned through atrocity that aspersions on our character lead to persecution. It is wrong and dangerous to imply that every Muslim is a potential terrorist, just as it is wrong and dangerous to say, because of the killings at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado last week, that every Christian should be viewed as a potential murderer. Our country, like every other, needs to take concerted action to safeguard its borders and its citizens. Terrorists wreaking havoc on every continent from their base in the Middle East must be stopped before they spread so much fear that civilized countries sacrifice the ideals that are the most important guarantors of our security. During Hanukkah, Jews light additional candles every night to dispel darkness, to counter fear, to encourage faith. Donald Trump 2019s proposal is a vote for darkness.

Oakland City Council President Lynette Gibson McElhaney speaks during a press conference at the Oakland Museum of California, in Oakland, CA Friday, April 22, 2016. Oakland councilwoman broke city, state rules, report says An Oakland city councilwoman broke state and city ethics rules by interfering with the approval process for a five-unit town house development planned for a lot next door to her home, according to a civil grand jury report released Tuesday. The councilwoman inappropriately wielded her position and used city resources to contact a department head to argue her objections and cause a re-evaluation that stalled the project, according to the report of the Alameda County grand jury. Although the report does not name the councilwoman, a source with knowledge of the grand jury probe identified her as City Council President Lynette Gibson McElhaney, and city documents show the address of the project lot as 530 32nd St. in West Oakland, which is next door to McElhaney 2019s home. The interference by the councilwoman led to several revisions and downsizing of the building plans, and the project was approved in 2014, according to the report. But the project has not been built. Instead, the property owner is offering the lot for sale. 201cThe property owner is concerned that further battles with the city may occur while attempting to obtain permits and constructing the town house project, 201d the report states. 201cWitnesses to the grand jury testified that developers are reluctant to purchase the property due to the council member 2019s interference. 201d McElhaney did not return calls seeking comment. 201cAs public servants, elected officials are precluded from seeking to influence a decision in which they have a financial interest, 201d the grand jury report stated. The report noted that 201cthe councilmember had a material financial interest in governmental decisions based on the proximity of the town house project to her residence and the likelihood that her privacy would be adversely impacted. 201d The saga began in January 2014 as the property owner, who is not identified in the report, was in the midst of working with the city planning department on a design for the five-townhouse project with downtown views in a part of Oakland long starved for development. The property owner was contacted by a 201cnext-door neighbor who stated that his wife was an Oakland city councilmember and further stated that he and his wife would be working to stop the project if the design was not changed to their liking, 201d according to the report. Shortly afterward, the report states, the councilwoman contacted Oakland Planning and Building Department chief Rachel Flynn to complain about the town house project. It says Flynn visited the lot, decided the design was subpar and pressured the property owner to make several modifications to mollify the councilwoman and her husband. Flynn also installed herself as a point person for the project and urged the property owner to submit the revised plans to the councilwoman and other neighbors before turning them in to the city, the report stated. At Flynn 2019s urging, the owner decreased the height of the building, reduced the number of dwellings from five to four and diverted the views away from McElhaney 2019s house, instead directing them toward a freeway wall and another neighbor 2019s home, according to the report. The grand jury found that the councilwoman 201cdirectly violated ethics rules 201d by calling Flynn and that Flynn 2019s involvement 201cgave the appearance that the department head was an advocate for the council member. 201d The councilwoman also used her influence to attack Flynn and suggest that the planning staff had flouted city procedures in approving the town house development, the report said. The grand jury report states that an email it reviewed showed the councilwoman telling the planning director that the town house project approval raised 201ca series of serious concerns for your department, including how well you track and enforce the city 2019s procedures. 201d Flynn referred questions to the city administrator 2019s office, which issued a statement Tuesday acknowledging the ethics rules and promising to work with Oakland 2019s Public Ethics Commission to ensure that rules are followed. The city planning and zoning commissions ultimately approved the modified design on March 21,2014, but it still did not placate McElhaney and her husband, who filed an appeal two weeks later. Oakland 2019s Planning Commission denied their appeal on Dec. 17, but the project has not been built. In its report, the grand jury recommended that the Public Ethics Commission conduct its own probe of the councilwoman 2019s interference with the project and that the commission 201creinforce 201d its ethics training for city officials and employees. The grand jury also encouraged the City Council to consider censuring the councilwoman for using her office for personal gain. Public Ethics Commission head Whitney Barazoto said the commission opened an investigation on Feb. 18, 2015. That investigation is continuing. Rachel Swan is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

   "input": "Vancouver will find a way to tax its vacant homes, possibly by treating them as business investments, to ease the Canadian city's housing affordability crisis, Mayor Gregor Robertson says. If implemented, the tax could drive up costs for many foreign investors who have helped make the west coast city Canada's most expensive property market and send new investors to other countries, including Australia. Robertson said the city would give the British Columbia government until August 1 to respond to its plan to tax nearly 11,000 empty homes in Vancouver. If Vancouver fails to win provincial backing, Robertson said, the city would begin drafting its own regulations to create a business tax on empty homes that are held as investments. We are going to make sure that those who treat housing as a business are treated and taxed accordingly for that use , Robertson told reporters. A tax rate has not been decided , but it needs to be high enough that there is an incentive for owners to rent out their homes, Robertson said, adding that vacancy rates in Vancouver are close to zero. Robertson said the city's preferred option was to work with the province, which already has data on whether properties are vacant. If it goes it alone, the city would also have to enact a new business tax by-law, something that could take time and be expensive to administer and enforce. In a tweet, British Columbia Premier Christy Clark said the province was reviewing the city's report and would respond quickly. If high enough, the tax could make housing markets elsewhere in the world more attractive for foreign investors and cool blistering demand for Vancouver real estate, said CIBC economist Benjamin Tal. It might make the difference between Sydney and Vancouver , he said. More than 90 per cent of detached homes in Vancouver are worth more than C$1 million ($A1.04 million) , compared with 19 per cent a decade ago, according to a study released last week. In the Greater Vancouver region, home prices have risen 46.9 per cent in the last five years. Despite this rise, the province has hesitated to intervene, and only recently took small steps to start tracking foreign buyers and to slow aggressive flipping activity.  ",

Almost every month, on average, another child dies from window cord strangulation, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). These cords are on the commission 2019s list of the top five 201chidden hazards 201d in the home. The industry for years has said that voluntary manufacturing standards and its own educational programs were enough to reduce the death toll. But the government now thinks that may not be enough. The CPSC voted unanimously on Wednesday to start the rulemaking process that could eventually lead to mandatory safety standards for all new window coverings. 201cKeeping children from being strangled to death is first and foremost for me when it comes to window covering cords, 201d said CPSC Chairman Elliot Kaye in a statement. 201cNo matter the final approach 2013 whether it is a comprehensive federal standard or a vastly improved voluntary standard 2013 I feel the urgency to having this hazard addressed, so families with young children and businesses can have confidence in the safety of these products. 201d The commission 2019s action was in response to a petition filed in May 2013 by seven consumer groups, including Parents for Window Blind Safety. Linda and Matt Kaiser of St. Louis, Missouri, started the non-profit after their one-year-old daughter Cheyenne Rose was strangled to death by a window blind cord in her room. 201cWe 2019ve been fighting for 12 years to get the industry to take the outer cords off of all window coverings, 201d Linda Kaiser said. 201cThere 2019s really no excuse. The technology is there. You see cordless window coverings in every store. The industry just doesn 2019t want to make the change because they 2019re not being forced to do it and I think the government has finally seen that. 201d The Window Covering Manufacturers Association (WCMA), the industry 2019s trade group, said it was 201cextremely disappointed 201d by the CPSC 2019s decision, but remained confident the commission will ultimately conclude that the industry 2019s voluntary standards are working and there is no need for government action. Executive director Ralph Vasami said there is no 201cuniversal technological fix that exists today 201d that would cover the wide-variety of window coverings on the market. 201cThe petition 2019s proposal to 2018eliminate accessible cords or make cords inaccessible 2019 would only result in removing safe products from the market and cost thousands of jobs throughout the United States, 201d Vasami said in a statement after the CPSC 2019s decision. He said a rule that banned corded window covering products could cause consumers to hold onto unsafe products longer. 201cThis would create a less safe environment because the CPSC 2019s own data show that more than 80 percent of incidents occur with older products that don 2019t meet current standards or where the consumer did not install or use the product properly, 201d Vasami added. Two-year-old Cormac Thomas died in March due to asphyxiation from a window covering cord. This is one of at least 7 such deaths since the beginning of the year. Erica Thomas For years, the industry has warned parents about the strangulation hazards posed by corded blinds and shades. The CPSC estimates that between 1996 and 2012,1,590 children were treated for injuries, including brain damage, caused when they became entangled in these cords. Data collected by Parents for Window Blind Safety show there were 285 deaths and serious injuries during this same time period. The group says it knows of seven deaths so far this year. Two-year old Cormac Thomas of Bethesda, Md. was one of those seven. Erica and Stephen Thomas said they tried to make their toddler 2019s room as safe as possible. They said they bought shades that met the industry 2019s voluntary safety standards. The cord was always tied up to a hook on the ceiling, so Cormac couldn 2019t reach it. On March 1, Erica came into the room and found Cormac lying underneath his window with his two favorite stuffed animals. As she got closer, she noticed his lips and fingernails were turning blue. He didn 2019t have a pulse. She called 9-1-1 and started CPR. But, it was too late. Cormac was pronounced dead at the hospital. As best she can tell, Cormac put his head into the shades to look outside the window and got caught in the cords inside the shades. 201cI would rather hang a garbage bag or sheet over my window, than put something there that would harm my child, 201d Thomas said. There is no way to tell if the CPSC will adopt new mandatory safety standards for window shades or when that might happen. It could take years. The CPSC recommends that only cordless window coverings be used in homes where children live or visit. If you have corded window shades, the CPSC and the industry 2019s own Window Covering Safety Council have information on what to do to reduce the risk. The Parents for Window Blind Safety has produced a PSA, In An Instant, which depicts the common window covering accident scenario. It explains that these strangulation accidents are quick and quiet and can happen even when parents are extremely safety conscious. Erin Shero 2019s son Colton died on October 17,2013, just two days shy of his second birthday. She left Colton alone in his room, just long enough to get him a snack. She said she was gone less than two minutes. When she returned, Colton wasn 2019t moving. She thought he was asleep, until she found the cord around his neck. Little Colton lost his life just two days away from his second birthday. The blinds in his room met voluntary safety standards. 201cMy son should not have died this way, 201d his mother said. Erin Shero 201cMy son should never have died this way, 201d Shero said. 201cWe baby-proofed everything, but I had no idea how dangerous these cords are. 201d Shero, of Hixon, Tennessee, said the blinds met voluntary industry standards and had a breakaway cord, but they didn 2019t protect her son. 201cI will struggle with this for the rest of my life. I will never forget what that looked like, what he looked like, how horrible it was and how helpless I felt. 201d Herb Weisbaum is The ConsumerMan.

Unlike every other household in Sodeto - seventy to be precise - Mitsotakis did not buy a participation , a slice of the winning ticket.

   "input": "The commodore in charge of the two US Navy boats that strayed into Iranian waters, leading to the capture of his 10 sailors for 16 hours in January, will be relieved of command, likely putting an end to his career, Fox News has learned. Capt. Kyle Moses, commodore of Commander Task Force (CTF) 56, was responsible for the two riverine boats and Kuwait-based crew. The chief of naval operations, Adm. John Richardson, is set to release a long-awaited report on June 30 about the events surrounding the January incident now that the investigation is complete. Iranian Revolutionary Guard forces captured the two high-speed patrol boats near Farsi Island, a well-known Iranian base, hours after the boats left Kuwait on Jan. 12 to sail to Bahrain. Five sailors were aboard each boat. Watch Iranian TV footage of the captured American sailors: The Navy crew was inexperienced and running late to make a rendezvous at a refueling point in the Persian Gulf when the capture took place, according to officials. The detention of the American crew came the same day as President Obama 2019s State of the Union address and came at a sensitive time for the administration, days before formally implementing the nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers led by the United States. Days after the incident, Defense Secretary Ash Carter said the Navy patrol boats had 201cmisnavigated 201d into Iranian territorial waters. The second-in-command of the riverine squadron, Cmdr. Eric Rasch, was fired from his job last month. Multiple defense officials tell Fox News a 201cmultitude of errors 201d led to the capture of the US Navy crew. First, there was no navigation brief, a major violation of Navy protocol. When any Navy ship gets under way, even for something as minor as shirting berths from one pier to another, it is standard for a Navy crew to conduct a navigation brief discussing issues such as hazards to navigation or, in this case, an Iranian base near the planned course. Second, the chain of command was not well defined on the two boats. While a young lieutenant was the highest-ranking individual on either of the two 50-foot boats, when the order was given to evade the Iranian forces, the helmsman refused the order. Third, defense officials tell Fox News the Navy had become too complacent with its treatment by Iranian forces in the months leading up to the January capture. 201cThe story here is these guys had gotten so used to Iranians doing stupid s 2014, having weapons pointed at them all the time, they didn 2019t know they were being captured until the Iranians boarded their boats, 201d one defense official said, describing the lack of situational awareness by the Navy crew. 201cThey messed up pretty bad. 201d It was not immediately clear whether Richardson would announce punishments during the release of his report or a short time later. Other sailors aboard the two ships likely face disciplinary action as well, but Navy officials have refused to disclose the number. The detention of the US sailors created an uproar on Capitol Hill as Iran released a videotaped apology from the Navy lieutenant. Many in the military questioned whether the Code of Conduct, which forbids any captured American troops from making such statements, was violated. Under terms of the code, American service members are required to give only a name, rank, service number and date of birth to captors. Other video clips showing some of the 10 sailors crying sparked additional international outrage. Secretary of State John Kerry had thanked the Iranians for their treatment of the sailors before the video showing the apology and crying was released. Iran 2019s Ayatollah Ali Khamenei awarded medals to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard crew who detained the American sailors. In February, a re-enactment of the sailors 2019 capture was displayed during parades around Iran celebrating the 1979 Iranian Revolution. On the same day the sailors were taken captive, Iran flew a drone over the USS Harry S. Truman in the Persian Gulf. And when the aircraft carrier sailed past the Strait of Hormuz in late December, a group of Iranian missile boats fired unguided rockets only 1,500 yards away, in a move the Navy called 201chighly provocative. 201d This article originally appeared on Fox News.

   "input": "When Mara Wilson was welcomed into the 20th Century Fox family, someone told the 5-year-old that they planned to make her the next Shirley Temple. 201cI remember feeling enormous pressure because I didn 2019t want to be Shirley Temple, 201d said Wilson, now 26. 201cShirley Temple was Shirley Temple, and I didn 2019t ever feel like I could live up to that. 201d Temple, who died at age 85 Monday, Feb. 10, set the precedent for all child actors. She was the first, the most successful, and seemingly the happiest. Temple might have entered the Hollywood elite at a young age, but she left it young as well 2014 and unlike many modern young stars, she escaped more or less unscathed. Although Wilson didn 2019t reach Shirley Temple levels of fame 2014 and, to our knowledge, didn 2019t inspire any mocktails 2014 her roles in Mrs. Doubtfire, Miracle on 34th Street ( 201cwhich is funny because I 2019m Jewish, 201d she said), and Matilda made her a 201990s icon. But Wilson, too, went into early retirement 2014 fueled in part by her mother 2019s death during Matilda 2019s post-production. That was when things stopped being fun and turned into a chore. 201cVery slowly I realized, too, that I was getting older, 201d she said. 201cAnd I wasn 2019t exactly aging gracefully. I was kind of awkward, and I didn 2019t feel like I really belonged there anymore, and Hollywood didn 2019t really want me either. So I consider it something of a mutual breakup: I was pretty much over Hollywood, and it was like, 2018Well, you aren 2019t really cute anymore, so we don 2019t know what to do with you. 2019 And it was fine with me. 201d Many child actors experience the puberty push-out. Jeff Cohen 2019s iconic 201ctruffle shuffle 201d (see below) when he played Chunk in The Goonies might be an audience favorite, but he was left unwanted when he started losing his baby fat. But Cohen recalled that even Shirley Temple suffered a similar fate when she grew up and her blonde curls turned brown. Temple wrote in her autobiography how her agent Lew Wasserman, a mogul at MCA, pulled the actress into his office and told her that she was through 2014 201cwashed up. 201d When Temple began to cry, Wasserman offered her only a tissue and the salty line, 201cHave one on me. 201d 201cAfter making the studio enormous amounts of money, her usefulness was at an end. She was discarded, 201d Cohen told TIME via email. 201cSuch is the nature of many businesses, including show business. 201d Luckily, Goonies director Richard Donner gave Cohen an introduction to the business side of Hollywood, rather than a Kleenex. This helped lead Cohen to a career as a high-profile entertainment attorney, with a biography page that asks clients not to hold his 201cdubious 201d past as a child actor against him. Cohen admires Temple 2019s seamless transition into the second chapter of her life. 201cMuch like the optimistic heroines she played in her films, she did not become embittered, 201d he said. 201cShe chose to transcend the darkness and build a beautiful and productive life. 201d Indeed, as has been vividly recalled in the days since her passing, Temple went on to be a mother, a prominent Republican fund-raiser, a delegate to the United Nations General Assembly, and a diplomat to Ghana and Czechoslovakia before the fall of Communism. Ilan Mitchell-Smith, best known for his starring role in Weird Science, found inspiration in Temple 2019s ability to be so wildly successful at one thing and then deciding that it was no longer for her. 201cFor her to end up successfully doing a job that was so unrelated, I think it 2019s kind of a model for what is possible, 201d said Mitchell-Smith. 201cI think one of the benefits of winning that lottery when you 2019re young is that you can have that moment and can still decide,what will I really enjoy and be fulfilled doing. I was always talking to people about history and very old stories 2014 basically it was a result from being a really big Dungeons and Dragons nerd. I just wanted to pursue it as much as I could and maybe teach it. 201d He is now an English professor at Cal State Long Beach. Josh Saviano, who played Paul on the Wonder Years, decided that the end of high school (which coincided with the end of the series) would be his time to step back and reassess if he wanted to act. 201cI wanted to live a 2018normal 2019 life for a little bit and see where that led me, 201d he said. 201cIf during the course of the next four years during school or after school the pull would bring me back in, I would do it. And it just didn 2019t. 201d So Saviano became an intellectual property lawyer, largely dealing with corporate and celebrity branding. 201cShirley Temple is one of the people who created her own brand, She took all this notoriety and became a leader for diplomacy and advocacy, 201d he said. Saviano believes he has managed a similar shift 2014 201calthough not nearly to the same degree of success, 201d he said. 201cBut it seems like a proper brand to go from child actor to this protector of brands and talent. 201d Of course, not all former child stars feel as satisfied with their transition out of Hollywood. Like Temple, Sheila Kuehl was discovered in a tap-dancing class at Meglin Kiddie Studios. She went on to star in The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis between 1959 and 1963. 201cI was pretty deeply in the closet, but I had been gay since about the age of 18 2014 at least that 2019s when I knew it, 201d she said. After the president of CBS saw her pilot for a Dobie Gillis spinoff, Kuehl remembers, 201cHe said, 2018I think she 2019s just a little too butch 2014 let 2019s not try to sell it. 2019 I assumed that meant people knew, and my phone just stopped ringing. 201d Kuehl found fulfillment as a law school student in the 201970s and became the first openly gay person elected to the California legislature in 1994.

Swathes of agricultural land across the state was left underwater by heavy rain in early June and property owners are still reeling from the damage - some of which they have described as irreparable. On Tuesday, more than seven weeks after the flood peak, state and federal governments offered joint support of $5.5 million, with grants of up to $10, 000 available to help farmers with clean-up and restoration activities. These farmers need help and providing financial assistance for removing debris , disposing of dead livestock, salvaging crops, grain and feed, and repairing plants and equipment can make all the difference, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Premier Will Hodgman said in a joint statement. Primary producers through central , west, east and northern Tasmania may be eligible to apply. In some cases pastures have been carved open by floodwaters or falling trees, or buried by up to a metre of river silt. Dead livestock has meant setbacks in genetics. We are pleased to hear that the state government has acknowledged our concerns about the social , economic and environmental impacts that the floods have had on our farming communities, Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association chief Peter Skillern said. Assessment of the flood damage will continue and the grants could be increased and extended to other local government areas.  ",

Both events are open to the public. Musical competitions have been around as long as there have been musicians.

Depending on the legend, the Games were instituted either to commemorate the feat of Apollo killing Python, the earth-dragon who lived at Delphi, or to expiate the blasphemy of his chasing Python into the sacred temple in order to do it. Either way, the singing of a Hymn to Apollo was the Pythian Games 2019 first contest; according to the historian Pausanias, the first champion was Chrysothemis, son of Carmanor, who (in some accounts) cleansed Apollo after his slaying of Python.

   "input": "Overwatch sounds like a game I shouldn 2019t want to play: a hero-focused team shooter that seems aimed at players given to godlike acts of ballistic skill. But I should know better. This is Blizzard we 2019re talking about, after all, a studio that turned a generic fantasy-verse born from a niche real-time strategy game into a global online roleplaying sensation. (And in just a few weeks, a $160-million-to-make film by a BAFTA-winning director.) After chatting with Overwatch director Jeffrey Kaplan, I 2019m almost convinced it 2019s a game for me 2014the sort of lapsed, Quake-era clanner who 2019s lost interest in competitive shooters. Here, by way of our lightly edited conversation, is a rundown of why. 201cAt its core, Overwatch is a game that takes pace in a bright, hopeful version of what we imagine planet Earth to be sometime in the near future, 201d says Kaplan when asked to sum up game 2019s premise. 201cThe predominant focus of the game is on really deep, exciting heroes and the cool abilities and the epic, over-the-top battles they have. These battles are taking place on a global battlefield in a number of exotic locations, so anywhere from Greece to Egypt to China to Japan, spanning the globe. 201d 201cThe game is what we call a team-based shooter, and that means you 2019re always playing with and against real people. We do have a play versus the computer mode, but at its core, you 2019re playing competitively against and with other players. The real focus of the shooting in the game is not to chase realism. We don 2019t have real world guns in the game. You 2019re not playing a soldier in a present-day military conflict. The game tries to stretch the imagination of . . . almost like what would these heroes be if you thought of them more as superheroes, and what would superheroes with guns look like. 201d 201cThe shooting itself, we took a lot of inspiration from present-day shooters, 201d says Kaplan. 201cWe love games like Call of Duty and Battlefield and think very highly of them. But we also took a lot of inspiration from old school shooters, like Quake and Doom and Unreal and Tribes. The shooter 2019s a celebrated genre that 2019s been around for decades, and we wanted to take inspiration from the whole thing, not just one era. 201d 201cIt 2019s always a Blizzard goal to speak to as wide an audience as possible, 201d says Kaplan. 201cWith our games, our development process is to always focus on the core or hardcore elements first, so we know we have something rich and deep and long lasting. We don 2019t start out casual, but once we 2019ve had that core of deep, rich, re-playable gameplay, we look at other ways of expanding the audience and going 2018How could we make this more approachable to people?' 201d 201cWith Overwatch, the game obviously speaks to a lot of shooter fans. They were instantly attracted and some of the earliest adopters in our community. But what 2019s cool about Overwatch is, because we were putting such a focus on team play and unique heroes, the MOBA [multiplayer online battle arena, a real-time strategy genre variant] audience started to take note of us, because there were all these fantastic MOBAs out there. Heroes of the Storm, League of Legends, Defense of the Ancients 1 and 2. They 2019re not shooters, but they 2019re team-oriented games where the main objective is 2018Do we win or lose as a team? 2019 So those players started to take notice. That had an instant broadening effect on the audience, where we weren 2019t just speaking to shooter fans anymore. 201d 201cWe did a lot with the gameplay itself to make it more approachable, 201d says Kaplan. 201cObviously things like the tutorial, and putting a practice range in the game where you can safely play any hero without fear of dying. But it 2019s also in how we approached the hero design itself, where we focused on abilities that would speak to players who weren 2019t instantly knowledgeable about twitchy shooter gameplay, like someone who can 2019t put the reticle over a target at 100 meters out. 201d 201cSo we designed things like one hero 2019s gun having a lock-on beam, or another 2019s that doesn 2019t require precise aim but has more of a cone attack that could hit any enemy without having to be precise with crosshairs. We added healing classes that don 2019t require precise aim to do their healing. So a player who 2019s never played a shooter before, or was more familiar with team-based games like a MOBA, could instantly come in and be effective and contribute to their team, even if they lacked the twitch skill to put crosshairs over targets downrange. 201d 201cOur progression system is so simple, 201d says Kaplan. 201cYou play matches, you earn experience points, with experience you gain levels, and every time you gain a level you earn a loot box. It sounds super-basic, but we actually struggled with the progression system for years. We had two previous systems, and they had power progression where if you played a certain hero more, that hero would get better. But we realized we were creating a schism between players who would play more, versus those with less time. And what was interesting about moving away from that system, is that both the hardcore and casual were very pleased that we took power progression away and moved to a more cosmetic system. 201d 201cThe hardcore didn 2019t like power progression because they will always argue that the playing field should be as even as possible, and that time investment shouldn 2019t count for player skill or power. And the casual loved it because it protected their choice to maybe not play as much. Plus it solved a problem with the basic way you read the game, because with power progression, you had no way of determining if someone was good or not. 201d 201cIt 2019s going to sound like we did this strategically, but we honestly did it because it 2019s what our passion and instincts were, 201d says Kaplan. 201cWhen it comes to the setting and art style and tone of the universe, a lot of games like to approach the future in either a very dystopian way, or a post-apocalyptic way, or a combination of the two. We kept asking ourselves, because we 2019ve explored fantasy universes before with Warcraft and Diablo, and we 2019ve explored science fiction with StarCraft. But we 2019ve never really done something that takes place on planet Earth before. 201d 201cSo we started asking 2018What could be exciting in the Blizzard style that would speak to our developers and get them excited about doing a game in the near future on Earth? 2019 We wanted to make something bright and welcoming, that featured a lot of deep, rich colors. A lot of the modern realistic games tend to focus on gritty gray, brown palettes. 201d 201cWe felt it wasn 2019t a space that 2019s been commonly explored. There aren 2019t worlds built like this for you to adventure in. I don 2019t want to discount any work that anyone else has done, because every video game is extremely difficult to make. But I think it 2019s almost more difficult to try to make a super-interesting, compelling, bright, hopeful future, than it is to make one that 2019s wrecked and bombed out. There 2019s an immediate emotional impact, like if I were to say 2018Our game takes place in Washington, D.C. in the future and the White House has been bombed out, 2019 there 2019s an immediate emotional impact that comes with that. 201d 201cBut I think it 2019s different when you look at the creative challenge of saying 2018We want to do a game that takes place in the near future and we think there 2019s this amazing base that exists on the Rock of Gibraltar. 2019 I think it 2019s a much more difficult creative challenge, to figure out a way to get players to emotionally respond to that and understand it. And it 2019s been our experience with our previous games, that if you broaden the art style and make it inviting and welcoming, you can broaden the audience as well. 201d 201cIt 2019s something that I think not only Blizzard, but me as a developer have been wrestling with for years, 201d says Kaplan. 201cThere 2019s this desire to categorize players, to declare that there 2019s such a thing as competitive, hardcore and casual. People seem to want to stratify and organize players by different play styles. And I was always fascinated, because I spent many years working on World of Warcraft, and casual and competitive and hardcore . . . these terms are all so subjective. 201d 201cSo I would have people come up to me and say, 2018I really enjoy World of Warcraft. I 2019m just a casual player, like I only raid twice a week, but I really love World of Warcraft. 2019 And then you 2019d have somebody else say 2018I 2019m super hardcore in World of Warcraft, I 2019ve been loving the game and I 2019m about to get max level in it. 2019 I don 2019t think players know how to stratify themselves into these categories they 2019re creating. I wish people would talk more in terms of 2018Here 2019s how the experience is fun or not fun for me 2019 and not worry so much about the gamer to their left or right, and trying to figure out if the way they 2019re playing is correct or not. Some of us who are a little bit older and have been playing games our whole lives realize that there 2019s an ebb and flow to how hardcore or casual we can be at any time, and I think that makes us more open minded. 201d 201cWe very much believe in inclusivity at Blizzard, and I like to talk about inclusivity even more than diversity, 201d says Kaplan. 201cWe want Overwatch to be this bright, positive universe, where everybody feels like they could be a hero. That 2019s our most basic goal. It 2019s to say 2018It doesn 2019t matter what my walk in life is, or the dice roll I got. Did Blizzard make my exact situation an Overwatch hero? Maybe, maybe not, but I could absolutely see how it could be included in that universe.' 201d 201cThe funniest part about Overwatch from the get-go is that what excited us creatively was this cast of heroes who were epic and unique, where no hero was like another. Early on we talked about that in terms of the gameplay, like we don 2019t have two rocket launcher heroes, for example. But it started to permeated every decision we made, how these characters look, what gender, what body type and how they associate themselves. This may sound bizarre, but the great diversity in Overwatch is more a byproduct of us wanting to make really unique, awesome heroes that spoke to the team creatively. 201d  ",

In 1979 he sent one of his reporters off to the Caribbean island of Mustique to take pictures of Princess Margaret and her new boyfriend, Roddy Llewellyn, a tale which the other nationals had decided not to touch. Although the princess and her husband, Lord Snowdon, had separated a few years earlier, the full-page splash, featuring a picture of the princess and Llewellyn sitting at a table in beach clothes, left the public in little doubt about the true state of affairs and was said to have precipitated Snowdon 2019s departure from Kensington Palace. 201cThey were not very happy at the Palace, 201d Shrimsley recalled. He also won admiration for publishing the criminal records of two leading members of the National Front, in defiance of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act, one of a series of expos 00e9s which were believed to have contributed to a collapse in public support for the extreme Right-wing organisation. The son of a tailor 2019s pattern cutter, Bernard Shrimsley was born in London on January 13 1931 and showed his mettle at a young age when he and his younger brother Anthony (who would also enjoy a successful career in Fleet Street) were evacuated in the Second World War to a family which mistreated them and Bernard persuaded the local police to secure their release. After leaving Kilburn Grammar School, and a year as a messenger boy at the Press Association, he joined the Southport Guardian as a trainee reporter, staying for five years (including two years of National Service in the RAF). After stints at the Daily Mirror and Sunday Express, he landed his first editor 2019s job 2013 at the Daily Post in Liverpool, from which he was headhunted by Rupert Murdoch to work as Larry Lamb 2019s deputy on The Sun following its launch in 1969. He took some of his best journalists with him, including Frank Johnson, who became The Sun 2019s lobby correspondent before becoming a star parliamentary sketch-writer on The Daily Telegraph. While Lamb was the front man, Shrimsley was the hard-working creative brain of the new paper. During Shrimsley 2019s three years in the editor 2019s chair The Sun 2019s circulation rose dramatically, putting it on a path to becoming the 201csoaraway Sun 201d, Britain 2019s largest-selling daily title. By contrast circulation at News of the World fell under his editorship, although some blamed the decline on Murdoch 2019s refusal to heed Shrimsley 2019s pleas to turn it from its broadsheet format into a tabloid. In 1980 Shrimsley accepted an invitation from Lord Rothermere, chairman of Associated Newspapers, to become founding editor of The Mail on Sunday. He spent two years planning the launch but the paper failed to hit its sales targets and Shrimsley lasted only 10 weeks in the editor 2019s chair. He responded to this humiliation with good grace. In 2002, an editorial in Press Gazette marked The Mail on Sunday 2019s 20th anniversary by praising the way in which, after only 10 issues, David English, the editor of the Daily Mail (whom Rothermere had failed to consult about Shrimsley 2019s appointment, and who had opposed it), had 201cabseiled to the rescue 201d, bundled the editor out of the nearest exit and turned the paper round. What Press Gazette did not mention was the fact that the unfortunate editor was the same person as the author of the editorial 2013 Bernard Shrimsley. Shrimsley was rescued by his former colleague, Larry Lamb, by then editor of the Daily Express. He became Lamb 2019s assistant editor, then associate editor under Nick Lloyd. After retiring in 1996, Shrimsley served as vice-chairman of the Press Council and a member of the D-notice committee, which advises editors on news stories that compromise national security. As well as writing leaders for Press Gazette, he advised Sir James Goldsmith 2019s Referendum Party during the 1997 general election. He married, in 1952, Norma Porter, who died in 2009.

The researchers estimated that in the UK, ensuring that all youngsters reach a basic skills level by 2030 would add 3.65 trillion US dollars ( 00a32.33 trillion) to the nation's economy by 2095 (143 per cent of current GDP). On a separate measure, increasing the average achievement of current students by 25 points over the next 15 years would boost the UK's economy by 8.653 trillion US dollars ( 00a35.6 trillion) (340 per cent) However, Andreas Schleicher, special adviser on education policy at the OECD, said the UK needed to improve education 201cquickly 201d if it wanted to catch up with other European countries, which also include the Slovenia, Austria and Korea. 2022 Are some children born naughty? 2022 Schools must change to help poor, clever kids Speaking to the The Telegraph, Mr Schleicher said: 201cIf the UK wants to improve its education then it has to be able to raise standards by adding coherence to the education system, addressing underperforming schools and put a lot of investment in the teaching profession. 201d He also said education was a solid alternative to lead developed nations, like the UK, to economic growth rather than relying solely on printing money. In his introduction to the report, Mr Schleicher added: 201cWe can only grow ourselves out of bad economic conditions and, in the long run, that depends more than anything on equipping more people with better skills to collaborate, compete and connect in ways that drive our societies forward 2013 and on using those skills productively. He added: The first thing the results show is that the quality of schooling in a country is a powerful predictor of the wealth that countries will produce in the long run. Or , put the other way around, the economic output that is lost because of poor education policies and practices leaves many countries in what amounts to a permanent state of economic recession - and one that can be larger and deeper than the one that resulted from the financial crisis at the beginning of the millennium, out of which many countries are still struggling to climb. The study looked at the potential economic gain to be hand from bringing students up to a basic level of skills by 2030. It used data gathered from international tests taken by 15-year-olds around the world and examined the past relationship between improving skills and economic growth to quantify the possible economic impact of improving youngsters' skills. Overall , UK students scored an average of 504 in international maths and science tests. This was behind 19 other nations, including Slovenia (507.6), Poland (521.7) Vietnam (519.9) and Estonia (531). Singapore topped the list, with an average student performance of 562.5. The report goes on to show that in the UK, around 20 per cent of students are considered to be performing below a basic skills level. This means they struggle with simple questions such as circling the correct answers when asked what happens when muscles are exercised or have difficulty doing basic currency conversions.

It is just outside the part of the modern town of Battle, East Sussex, which has been traditionally accepted as being the battlefield, and which is registered as such by English Heritage. The government quango believes the fighting occurred in the grounds of Battle Abbey, which it now runs as a visitor attraction, offering tours of the surrounding area. According to the traditional account, accepted for almost a millennium, the abbey, now in ruins, was built on the battlefield itself, with the high altar marking the precise spot where Harold fell, reputedly with an arrow in his eye. However, no human remains or artefacts from the conflict have ever been found in the area, even though some 10,000 men are believed to have died there. The Time Team researchers were given permission to conduct the first dig of its kind there, excavating three long strips of earth, totalling almost 600ft, but were unable to unearth any evidence. They also concluded that area should be discounted because it was boggy, which invading Normans would not have wanted to use. The team also conducted a metal detector search of a 30,000 sq ft area of Caldbec Hill, one mile north of the 201cofficial 201d battlefield, where John Grehan, a historian from Shoreham, West Sussex, believes the clash took place, after studying a dossier of contemporaneous documents. In addition, the Normans erected a cairn of stones on the battle site to commemorate their victory, known as a 'Mount-joie 2019 in French. The summit of Caldbec Hill is still known as Mountjoy. But again, no evidence was found and the researchers discounted the site, concluding Harold would have found the hill top too large to defend with the force he had at his disposal. Instead, he would have moved to a more advantageous spot, further downhill. The team also dismissed a third site, proposed by Nick Austin, another local historian, who puts the scene two miles south of Battle, nearer the coast, at the village of Crowhurst. In support of his theory, he has pieced together information from medieval documents and the Domesday Book. He also bases his claims on what he believes are topographical clues in the Bayeaux Tapestry. The experts rejected the supposed archaeological findings put forward for this site - and instead selected their own. By conducting an aerial survey of surrounding countryside, they were able to create a picture of what the landscape was like before it was developed. It led them to conclude that Harold 2019s men did assemble on Caldbec Hill, before moving off, to a ridge of high land 2013 now occupied by the mini roundabout 2013 where they could take up a position to meet the Normans. In support of their theory, they cited an axe head, in the town museum, which could date from the battle. It is said to have been found in the approximate area of the roundabout, which is on the outskirts of the modern town, around 600ft from the Abbey itself on the Mountfield to Baldslow road. In the show, which is broadcast on Sunday evening, Tony Robinson, the presenter, says: 201cWe 2019re convinced this new location, east of the Abbey, is where the battle really took place. 201d The team believes Harold was at the centre of the fighting, at the roundabout, and died there. Robinson adds: 201cIt is a bizarre notion that our last Anglo-Saxon king died, not over there by the Abbey, but on that roundabout. 201d However, the proponents of the varying theories are not fully convinced. Both Mr Grehan and Mr Austin continue to believe theirs is the real battlefield while Roy Porter, the English Heritage curator for Battle Abbey said the roundabout was only the initial site of fighting and added: 201cTheir survey also reinforces the importance of the location of Battle Abbey. 201d EH has previously dismissed rival theories, but earlier this year announced that it would conduct a review into its decision not to change the registered battlefield, in response to a legal challenge in favour of the Crowhurst theory. A decision is expected next month.  ",

Academics at Canada's Concordia University measured finger lengths and personality differences among 415 men and women for the journal Personality and Individual Differences. The alpha males, whose ring fingers were longer than their index finger, were greater risk takers in all areas of their lives. These are often the kind of men women go for, said researcher Eric Stenstrom, because they are seen as fit, rich and assertive he added. He said: Our findings show an association between high testosterone and risk-taking among males in three domains: recreational , social and financial. Since women tend to be attracted to men who are fit , assertive and rich, men are apt to take risks with sports, people and money to be attractive to potential mates. What's interesting is this tendency is influenced by testosterone exposure 2013 more testosterone in the womb can lead to more risks in the rink , the bar and the trading floor in later in life. Women , however, show no difference in behaviour no matter what kind of finger lengths they have, said the study. Professor Gad Saad, lead researcher, said: In women , the two fingers are usually almost equal in length, as measured from the crease nearest the palm to the fingertip. In men, the ring finger tends to be much longer than the index. Previous studies have linked high testosterone levels with risky behaviour and financial success. We investigated the relationship between prenatal testosterone and various risk proclivities. Our findings show an association between high testosterone and risk-taking among males in three domains 2013 recreational , social and financial. The co-author Zack Mendenhall said: Pre-natal testosterone exposure not only influences fetal brain development but it also slows the growth of the index finger relative to the sum of the four fingers excluding the thumb. A previous study by Cambridge University showed that bankers in the City were more successful if they had longer ring fingers , suggesting they took more risks and reacted more quickly to market changes.

The trio arrived in Sydney aboard the Sea Princess on Sunday, after starting their journey in Southampton, England, with the cruise liner stopping at several South American countries along the way. Australian Border Force regional commander Tim Fitzgerald said it was the country's biggest ever cruise ship narcotics seizure. This is the biggest seizure of narcotics through a passenger stream , so either through the airport or cruise ships, this 95kg of cocaine is the largest seizure we've seen in Australia, he told reporters in Sydney on Monday. Authorities believe they've disrupted a major international crime gang attempting to flood Australian streets with illicit drugs. I can't go into the specifics about the background of this particular syndicate , but you've got to be a very well-organised syndicate to get your hands on 95kg of cocaine and attempt to import it here into Sydney, Commander Fitzgerald said. This particular cruise ship had a number of other ports it was going to visit while in Australia , but certainly the suggestion is that all 95kg of that cocaine was destined for the streets of Australia. The hefty haul of cocaine , which authorities estimate could be worth around $31 million, was allegedly discovered inside locked suitcases in two vessel cabins. Andre Tamine,63, Isabelle Lagace,28, and Melina Roberce,22, did not apply for bail at Sydney's Central Local Court on Monday and it was formally refused. The trio was charged with importing a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug after police and sniffer dogs searched the vessel when it berthed in Sydney. They face a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and will remain in custody until their next court appearance on October 26.

The mall operator said it will shelve plans for a 625-foot, 52-story residential tower along Dartmouth Street above the shopping center, citing high construction costs and concerns that Boston 2019s luxury housing market may be getting overbuilt. It would have been one of the tallest buildings in Boston, but was bedeviled for years by neighborhood concerns about affordable housing and engineering challenges building above the Massachusetts Turnpike and Orange Line. It was reviewed 2014and approved 2014three times by city regulators, the last in May 2015, but Simon never started construction. In a conference call with analysts Wednesday, Simon chief executive David Simon said his company was scrapping the project due to 201crapidly rising construction costs 201d in Boston and a worry there is more high-end housing coming than the market can support. 201cI would encourage everybody to study what 2019s going in construction costs and what 2019s going on in supply and demand 201d in Boston, he said, according to a transcript. 201cIt 2019s just not the right time to do it. 201d In 2013, Simon pegged the cost of the tower at $500 million. It 2019s unclear what its cost would be today 2014 a spokeswoman did not return calls seeking comment 2014 but construction costs have escalated significantly in recent years. Simon 2019s concerns come as some in the real estate community wonder if the current boom has peaked. Yet other builders are pushing ahead with high-end housing projects in Back Bay and downtown. Just this week, Weiner Ventures unveiled plans for a 40-story condo building at Boylston and Dalton Streets, and Millennium Partners reached a deal to buy the Winthrop Square Garage for $153 million, to build a 750-foot residential tower. And projects now under development say they 2019re selling well.

They said it made no difference that his illness was secondary to that of his mother 2019s or that he recovered after being separated from her. 201cHis mental illness diminished his moral culpability to a very significant degree, 201d Simpson said. 201cThe evidence persuades me that the applicant is genuinely remorseful, that he has accepted responsibility for his conduct, and that this indicates that he is unlikely to reoffend. 201d The court also found Barbieri 2019s sentence was disproportionate to that imposed on his mother. 201cThe circumstances of his life were such that he had not had the opportunity to develop even the maturity that might be expected of an average 19-year-old, 201d Simpson said. 201cHe lived alone on a rural property with a mentally ill mother whose delusions he came to share. 201d The dissenting judge, Justice Derek Price, agreed the sentencing judge made errors but found the mental illness did not substantially reduce Barbieri 2019s moral culpablity.

After all, I had borrowed a lot of money to cover tuition and other costs in graduate school, plus I still had undergraduate loans to pay off. But I'd always been told that I should try to get the best education possible -- even if it came at a hefty price tag -- to set myself up for the future. I wanted to pursue a career in a highly specialized field, and Duke offered one of the best programs for it. To me, it seemed worth the cost. So by the time I graduated in May 2011, I had accumulated about $160,000 in undergraduate and graduate student loans. It was a lot of money, but I knew a lot of people who were in the same boat, including my now wife, Kelly, who was in the same grad program and left Duke with about $108,000 in student loans. We knew that paying those amounts back would be a challenge, but neither one of us carried much bad debt -- I graduated with only about $1 ,000 in credit card debt, and Kelly had none -- so it wouldn't prevent us from meeting our future goals, right? Wrong. And I didn't realize just how much of an impact that debt would have until we attempted to buy our first home. The Banks' student loans triggered a too high debt-to-income ratio, preventing them from getting a mortgage. The Banks' loans triggered a high debt-to-income ratio, preventing them from getting a mortgage. A few months after graduation, Kelly and I relocated to Sacramento, California, because I found a contract position as a natural-resource specialist at the National Marine Fisheries Service. Kelly initially worked as an unpaid intern, then got a full-time, salaried position with the state as an environmental scientist about five months later. Combined, we made about $90,000. To ease our way into paying down our loans, we took advantage of the six-month grace period and other deferment options available to us. Kelly deferred her loans for a year, after which she began an income-based repayment plan that started her loan payments at just under $500 a month. Because she works for the government, she also qualifies for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which means her balances will be forgiven after 10 years, as long as she continues to make her minimum monthly payments on time. I got a three-year forbearance on all my federal loans. But the forbearance period on the private loans I took out for my undergrad days was up, so I had to start paying those back to the tune of about $350 a month. Together, our loan payments were a good chunk of change but manageable. And as we settled into our lives together and started planning for the future, Kelly and I decided that we wanted to buy a home as soon as we could. %VIRTUAL-pullquote-That's when we made rookie mistake No. 2: believing that a pre-approval for a mortgage guaranteed we'd actually get a mortgage.%Kelly's parents, who didn't want us to throw away our money by renting , decided to help fast-track that goal by giving us $18,000 to put toward a down payment and moving costs. In November 2012 we began the hunt. We didn't have issues getting pre-approved for a mortgage of up to $200,000. We intended to put only 5 percent down because we didn't want to use up all of our gift money, which meant we'd have to pay private mortgage insurance. But even with PMI, our potential mortgage payments would still be about the same as we were paying in rent, so we were OK with the added cost. To say the market was competitive was an understatement. Home prices in Sacramento were heating up and investors were swooping in. Every time we'd put an offer down, someone would outbid us or offer all cash. When one of our offers was finally accepted, we were ecstatic. We paid our earnest money and got as far as a home inspection -- only to discover that there were serious structural and electrical issues with the home. We decided to pull out of the offer, but we made a rookie home buyer mistake and signed away any contingencies that would have returned those funds to us. So the seller ended up keeping our earnest money. The bad news was that we were out $2,500. The good news: Another one of our offers was accepted on a newer home that was in far better shape. We were ecstatic. Our luck had finally turned around, and the nine months we had spent checking out dozens of properties was finally paying off. The house passed inspection, so we thought we were on our way to owning our first home. But then came time to get our mortgage. Since we were putting down less than 20 percent, we had to apply for a loan through the Federal Housing Administration. We didn't suspect there would be any issues, given that we had been pre-approved. But that's when we made rookie mistake No. 2: believing that a pre-approval for a mortgage guaranteed we'd actually get a mortgage. Apparently, the underwriters determined that our debt-to-income ratio was too high to get approved. While we knew we still had a lot of student loans to pay back, it hadn't raised any red flags before, so we weren't sure what was different now. Then our loan officer explained: Because I was a contractor, they weren't counting my income, which made it seem like our household income was about half of what it actually was. On top of that, they calculated Kelly's monthly loan payment as if she were on a standard repayment plan, rather than on an income-based one. That made her payments appear closer to $1,200 -- more than twice the $500 she was actually paying. We were told that banks often did that to account for the possibility that payments under an income-based repayment plan could shoot up every year, which could hurt a borrower's ability to pay the mortgage or be approved for future financing. Our realtor suggested we try a different lender, but at that point we were drained. Kelly and I realized that even if we tried to buy a less-expensive home, we'd run into the same problem. We probably wouldn't be approved for a mortgage until we paid off more of our loans or started earning a lot more money. Kelly and I have since gotten married, and we're now renting in a part of Sacramento where we would have wanted to buy. We still want to own a home, but we're being patient. We've crunched some numbers, and, based on how much we think our income will go up over time, we think we can try again in about five years. Ideally, we'd like to get closer to a 20 percent down payment, but realistically, we'll probably put down only 5 percent again. %VIRTUAL-pullquote-We want to be happy in our careers, own a home and have kids. You know, the American dream. But I can't help but think that obtaining that dream is no longer an option for those burdened by student loans.%Next time, however, we want to make sure we're fully qualified for a mortgage so we don't have to suffer a last-minute disappointment again. The wildcard is what my loans will be once my forbearance period is up. The rules for federal loan repayment seem to change a lot, so I don't know what options I'll have in the future for keeping those payments as low as possible. We do have about $2,000 left of the gift money from Kelly's parents (the rest was eaten up by moving expenses, other costs for our new rental and some wedding expenses). Kelly diverts $50 a month from her paycheck into a high-yield savings account to further build up our future down payment. I also try to save about $50 a month. She plans to boost that savings amount each time she receives a raise. And I'm hoping to find a non-contract, permanent position, which should help us when it comes time to apply for a mortgage again. We're trying to save in other ways too: We carpool every day, limit how much we eat out, and don't do many vacations. We've never had dreams of being super wealthy. We just want the things that most people want -- to be happy in our careers, own a home and have kids someday. You know, the whole American dream. But I can't help but think that obtaining that dream is no longer an option for those of us burdened by student loans. I don't want to make it sound like I regret attending the schools I did. School was where I met my wife, how I prepped to be competitive in my field, and where I met some of my closest friends. So I wouldn't change a thing about my education -- I just wish it hadn't cost so much. My generation, especially, has been given mixed signals by society. We're told to attend the best schools we possibly can -- but then we're punished when we can't afford it. 7 Financial Tasks to Accomplish Before You Hit 30 How Student Loans Dashed My Dreams of Buying a Home However responsible you plan to be in your 30s, there's one thing you simply can't make up for -- time. And when it comes to compounding interest, time is secret ingredient. : If a 25-year-old saves $3,000 a year for 10 years in a retirement account, the $30,000 investment will grow to $472,000 by age 65. If a 35-year-old saves $3,000 a year for 30 years (a full 20 years longer), the $90,000 investment will only be worth $367,000 at age 65. The moral? Your money's ability to make money babies increases exponentially if you let compounding interest start doing its thing while you're still in your 20s. Based on what you just read about compounding interest, it's a no-brainer that now is the time to start saving for retirement. If your company offers a 401(k) match, there's free money on the table, ready to be put toward your retirement each and every month. If your company doesn't offer retirement options or if you haven't yet settled into your career, another great retirement vehicle is a Roth individual retirement account. You can contribute up to $5,500 a year, and you can take the principal out at anytime with no penalty, if needed. The important thing is to put your money to work now so your 65-year-old self can retire comfortably later. If you don't already know where your credit report stands, now is the time to make yourself aware. You can get a free credit report from each of the three credit bureaus once a year, and now is the time to make sure there are no mistakes on your report. If your score is lower than you realized or if you discover any inconsistencies or problems, you have a head start on sorting it all out. Saving for a rainy day is essential, even if you're the luckiest person in town. As your responsibilities increase in your 30s, the possibility for unexpected costs goes up. And as your financial responsibilities increase, it could become more difficult to put away the money you'd need to get by for three to six months (a typical emergency fund amount). Preparing for a rainy day has to be done while the sun's out, and your 20s is just that time. If you're one of the seven out of 10 college students who graduated with student loan debt, you might be approaching your 30s in the red. Student loans may have a low interest rate, but they cannot be forgiven in bankruptcy. And as you add a spouse, a mortgage and even children to your life, the ability to pay down your student loans may become more difficult or burdensome. If the extra money is there now, pay those loans down. If, like us, you defied the marriage-age average and said I do before you hit 30 , life insurance is something worth looking into. When you're young and healthy, the costs are incredibly low. And should anything happen to you, your spouse will be grateful for the sure financial footing going forward. Make sure you get enough to cover any outstanding debt (including mortgages), funeral expenses and enough to help your spouse get back on his or her feet. While the average age of marriage is pushing 30, 44 percent of women have by age 25. If you find yourself already in the throes of parenting, the time to start thinking about your baby's education is now. By saving while he or she is still young, the amount you'll have to contribute later will be significantly less. How? You guessed it -- compounding interest via a 529 college savings plan.  ",

   "input": "Amazon.com is preparing to take on Apple Computer in digital music by introducing its own portable music player that would be linked to an online music service, according to several music industry executives involved with negotiations with Amazon. Unlike Apple, which sells songs for 99 cents each, Amazon will offer a service that charges a monthly or annual fee to customers, who will have the right to fill up their music players with as many songs as they like, the executives said. When they stop paying the fee, the music on the player will be disabled. Amazon has not told the music industry what the fee would be, but similar subscription services range from $5 to $15 a month. Apple, which sold 14 million iPods last year, has expanded its lead in digital music. Apple increased its market share last year in the United States to 67 percent of digital music players from under 49 percent in 2004, according to the sales and marketing research firm NPD Group. Music industry executives are enthusiastic about Amazon's entry because it might be a counterweight to Apple, which many see as having too much power in digital music. We are excited to participate in Amazon's launch , said Greg Scholl , the chief executive of the Orchard, the largest digital distributor of independent music. The Orchard, he said, has not reached a final agreement to provide music to Amazon's service. Given the quality of Amazon and its team , I'm sure it will be an innovative and successful music product, he said. Mr. Scholl declined to discuss any details of his negotiations with Amazon. In a conference call with investors last month , Thomas J. Szkutak, Amazon's chief financial officer, highlighted digital media as a major area of growth. As we move forward with digital , we think Amazon is especially well-positioned to capture a bigger part of that business, Mr. Szkutak said. Patty Smith , an Amazon spokeswoman, declined to elaborate on the company's plans. Amazon's intention to tie a subscription service to its own music player was reported yesterday by The Wall Street Journal. Music subscription services have been offered by Napster, AOL, Real Networks and Yahoo for several years, and have attracted about two million customers, industry executives said. One reason that the subscription services have not fared well is that the experience of using them with portable players is more difficult than using an iPod. The Microsoft software that all these services use has been awkward, and the players 0097 made by several manufacturers like Samsung, iRiver and Creative Labs 0097 have not been as appealing to consumers as those made by Apple. Amazon hopes to remedy these problems by designing its own player in conjunction with a consumer electronics maker, and ensuring that the software works easily with it. The player would be discounted for customers who agreed to buy the music service for a specified period, the music executives said. Amazon plans to load the player with songs of a customer's choosing before shipping it, the music executives said. And because Amazon maintains records of the CD purchases of its customers, it can also use that information to recommend music to be downloaded onto the players. The company, in fact, is looking to leverage its role as a major vendor of CD's as it moves into digital music. It has discussed with music labels the possibility of offering discounts to subscribers of its music service on CD purchases. It has also talked about giving CD purchasers digital versions of the songs, saving them the time and trouble of creating their own digital files to move onto the portable players. Record company executives say that the financial arrangements that underlie these potential discounts have not been finalized. They add that Amazon has said it hopes to introduce the service by summer. Ross Rubin, the director of industry relations with NPD, said that Amazon's plan to create its own brand of player faced challenges. A similar effort to create a Napster-branded player made by Samsung faltered, he said. The branded music player approach hasn't worked because of Apple's considerable iPod marketing and brand power , he said. But he did say that Amazon's customer relationships may give it an edge. It's a unique advantage for them , he said. Correction: Feb. 18 ,2006, Saturday: An article in Business Day yesterday about plans by Amazon.com to offer a digital music player to challenge the iPod misstated the number of iPods sold last year by Apple Computer. It was 32 million; 14 million was the figure for the fourth quarter.  ",

   "input": "By DAVID BIANCULLI DAILY NEWS TV CRITIC Tuesday, June 4th 2002, 1:80AM BOSTON 24 7. Tonight through Friday night at 10, continuing next week, ABC 3 1 2 stars. Consider Boston 24 7 , a new ABC documentary that occupies six hours of prime time this week and next , to be the antidote to the same network's The Hamptons. That four-hour special , like the one that premieres tonight at 10, sounds like the same basic offering: a filmmaking team descends on a particular place for three months and follows a few people around to see where they, and events, will lead them. All similarities end there. The Hamptons was aimless and uninteresting , and didn't come from the news division. It came from Barbara Kopple, whose previous work was bold and exciting, but who this time delivered a meandering disappointment. Boston 24 7 comes from ABC News - specifically , from Terence Wrong, who produced the wonderful Hopkins 24 7 two years ago. That 2000 summer series looked at physicians and other employees at one hospital; each hour of Boston 24 7 follows three or four people who are trying to make a difference in Boston: teachers , district attorneys, detectives, firefighters, even exterminators. Because of the way Wrong structures these six hours (tonight through Friday at 10, concluding next Tuesday and Wednesday), we get a strong sense of these characters, and of the city. Boston 24 7 achieves the nearly impossible: It gives reality television a good name. Poor Tommy Kaplanes , a green assistant district attorney, spends a heartbreaking amount of time trying to earn his first conviction. Detective Danny Keeler sets out to solve a headless body homicide, with help from years of experience, solid police work and a reliable police dog. Handlers for the mayor try to spin the day's events to their satisfaction, losing, like attorney Kaplanes, more often than they win. Chuck Tranito is a chef by night, rat man by day - and firefighter Phil Cetrino toils proudly in the same job that claimed the life of his father. In two separate hours , including tonight's opener, Boston 24 7 places cameras on both sides of the newsgathering process. On one end of the phone , we see Boston Mayor Thomas Menino and press secretary Carole Brennan making statements and arguing; on the other, Boston Herald reporter David Guerino tossing questions and typing. You don't often get to see news made, and shaped, in such a raw and real sense. Similarly, in tomorrow's second hour of Boston 24 7 , you see school principal Chuck McAfee fearing a student-teacher disagreement can escalate to something worse - which it does , suddenly and chillingly, as the cameras roll. When Kaplanes loses his first case, he takes a piece of evidence from it, a stolen license plate, and sticks it in plain view in his office cubicle. That'll be a constant reminder , he tells the camera , of how I sucked today. The producer of Boston 24 7 won't need any such reminders. Wrong , once again, has done everything just right.  ",

   "input": "By LISA REIN and LAURIE C. MERRILL With Larry Sutton and Jay Nieman Wednesday, April 19th 1995, 2:35AM Friends and family of Marlon Brando's daughter, Cheyenne, gathered in Tahiti yesterday to mourn the fragile beauty who was forever haunted by her lover's death. As of yesterday morning, it appeared that Cheyenne's legendary father would remain ensconced in his Hollywood mansion and not attend the funeral of his daughter. Brando,71, who moaned Oh , God no when he learned his daughter had hanged herself Easter Sunday , has been sedated since her death, friends said. Notoriously reclusive, Brando feared he could not maintain his coveted privacy on the tiny French Polynesian island in the South Pacific. There are just too many camera crews , too many paparazzi, Daniel Pardon , editor of the newspaper La Depeche de Tahiti and a family friend, told the Daily News. He could not keep his dignity. Born and reared in Tahiti , Cheyenne,25, spent most of her adult life fighting drug addiction and mental instability. She was in and out of drug clinics and psychiatric institutes and used so many drugs that her son was born addicted. Yesterday, Cheyenne's half-brother Miko Brando arrived in Papeete to attend Cheyenne's funeral and burial. But half-brother Christian who fatally shot Dag Drollet, the father of Cheyenne's son in 1990 is serving 10 years for manslaughter at a California prison. He was informed of his sister's death Monday by a case worker. I'm not going to tell you his reaction , said prison spokeswoman Terri Knight. That's private. As family members joined for the grim farewell , they were refusing comment to the media that swarmed the small island. It was unclear whether Cheyenne's 5-year-old son Tuki who has been in his grandmother's care since shortly after birth would attend the sad event. In one of many disappointments in Cheyenne's life, a Tahiti judge just two weeks ago rejected her bid for permanent custody of the boy. Cheyenne's mother, Tarita Teriipaia with whom Brando co-starred in the 1962 remake of Mutiny on the Bounty will retain custody. Dag Drollet's father , Jacques, who at first was bitter toward the Brandos, is expected to share custody of Tuki, Pardon said. Jacques Drollet openly accused Christian of murdering Dag in cold blood. At first the families hated each other , and Mr. Drollet accused Brando of killing his son. But this island is a little universe and people have to get along or they will self-destruct, Pardon said. Brando biographer Peter Manso believes the actor hadn't seen Cheyenne since the summer of 1993. Marlon had not returned to Tahiti since before the shooting [of Dag] about March of 1990. . . . They certainly hadn't seen each other since then. Maybe they spoke on the phone , but I doubt it, Manso told The News. Manso also spoke of the troubled father-daughter relationship. Cheyenne saw her father as a Svengali , a manipulator who was jealous of her boyfriend , the author said. Marlon wanted her to stay in L.A. and be his house maid , Manso told The News.  ",

   "input": "May 31st 2010, 8:47 by S.B. , BOGOT 00c1 PUNDITS and pollsters expected surprises in the first round of Colombia 2019s presidential election on May 30th, but they were supposed to come from Antanas Mockus. An eccentric former mayor of Bogot 00e1, Mr Mockus had little national exposure and virtually no backing when he launched his campaign. However, by tapping into an undercurrent of discontent with the corruption and human rights scandals that have plagued 00c1lvaro Uribe, the popular outgoing president, he engineered a rapid political ascent. Pre-election polls had him tied with Juan Manuel Santos, Mr Uribe 2019s former defence minister and unofficial chosen candidate, atop the crowded first-round field. Moreover, they gave him a comfortable lead in a run-off. Instead, the surprise came from Mr Santos, who showed that perhaps the original conventional wisdom about Mr Mockus was right after all. Mr Uribe 2019s unofficial candidate of choice won an imposing lead with 46.5% of the vote, more than doubling Mr Mockus 2019s 21.5% share. Seven other candidates split the remaining votes. Mr Mockus 2019s lack of campaign experience and a series of well-publicised gaffes hurt him badly. He first said he would extradite Mr Uribe, and then backtracked. Later, he said he 201cadmired 201d Hugo Ch 00e1vez, the radical president of Venezuela, who has cut off trade with Colombia over spats with Mr Uribe. His later efforts to clarify the comment by saying he only meant he 201crespected 201d Mr Ch 00e1vez, who is widely disliked in Colombia, did little good. Such missteps helped shift voters 2019 mood. Many were charmed at first by Mr Mockus 2019s promise to clean up the country 2019s politics. But by election day, they were simply 201cafraid to lose what 2019s been gained 201d under Mr Uribe, says Jaime Duarte, a political analyst. Mr Santos said his win was a tribute to the president, whose successful security policies have won him a 75% approval rating after eight years in power. Mr Mockus now faces a daunting task. It took him months to build up his standing in the polls, only to see it vanish on election day. He has just three weeks to close a 25-point deficit before the run-off on June 20th.  ",

   "input": "LOS ANGELES 2014 Attorneys for Michael Jackson's doctor dropped the bombshell Friday they've been hinting at for months 2013 an expert opinion accusing the legendary singer of causing his own death. Dr. Paul White, the defense team's star scientific witness, said Jackson injected himself with a dose of propofol after an initial dose by Dr. Conrad Murray wore off. He also calculated that Jackson gave himself another sedative, lorazepam, by taking pills after an infusion of that drug and others by Murray failed to put him to sleep. That combination of drugs could have had lethal consequences , the researcher said. White showed jurors a series of charts and simulations he created in the past two days to support the defense theory. He also did a courtroom demonstration of how the milky white anesthetic propofol could have entered Jackson's veins in the small dose that Murray claimed he gave the insomniac star. White said he accepted Murray's statement to police that he administered only 25 milligrams of propofol after a night-long struggle to get Jackson to sleep with infusions of other sedatives. How long would that (propofol) have had an effect on Mr. Jackson? asked defense attorney J. Michael Flanagan. If you're talking effect on the central nervous system , 10 to 15 minutes max, White said. He then said Jackson could have injected himself with another 25 milligrams during the time Murray has said he left the singer's room. So you think it was self-injected propofol between 11:30 and 12? asked Flanagan. In my opinion , yes, White said. The witness , one of the early researchers of the anesthetic, contradicted testimony by Dr. Steven Shafer, his longtime colleague and collaborator. Shafer earlier testified Jackson would have been groggy from all the medications he was administered during the night and could not have given himself the drug in the two minutes Murray said he was gone. He can't give himself an injection if he's asleep , Shafer told jurors last week. He called the defense theory of self-administration crazy. White's testimony belied no animosity between the two experts , who have worked together for 30 years. Although White was called out by the judge one day for making derogatory comments to a TV reporter about the prosecution case, White was respectful and soft spoken on the witness stand. When Flanagan made a mistake and called him Dr. Shafer a few times , White said, I'm honored. The prosecution asked for more time to study the computer program White used before cross-examining him. Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor granted the request , saying he too was baffled by the complicated simulations of Jackson's fatal dose. He recessed court early and gave prosecutors the weekend to catch up before questioning White on Monday. The surprise disclosure of White's new theory caused a disruption of the court schedule, and the judge had worried aloud that jurors, who expected the trial to be over this week, were being inconvenienced. But the seven men and five women appeared engaged in the testimony and offered no complaints when the judge apologized for the delay. Prosecutors could call Shafer back during their rebuttal case to answer White's assertions. Among the key issues is how White calculated that a large residue of propofol in Jackson's body could have come from the small dose that Murray says he administered. Shafer assumed Murray had lied, and he estimated Jackson actually was given 1,000 milligrams of the drug by Murray, who he said left the bottle running into an IV tube under the pull of gravity. White disputed that, saying an extra 25 milligrams self-administered by Jackson would be enough to reach the levels found in his blood and urine. White also said a minuscule residue of the sedative lorazepam in Jackson's stomach convinced him the singer took some pills from a prescription bottle found in his room. He suggested the combination of lorazepam, another sedative, midazolam, plus the propofol could have killed Jackson. It potentially could have lethal consequences , said White. ... I think the combination effect would be very , very profound. White's testimony was expected to end Murray's defense case after 16 witnesses. It likely will be vigorously challenged by prosecutors , who spent four weeks laying out their case that Murray is a greedy, inept and reckless doctor who was giving Jackson propofol as a sleep aid in the singer's bedroom. Experts including Shafer have said propofol is not intended to treat insomnia and should not be given in a home. White's theory was based on urine and blood levels in Jackson's autopsy, evidence found in Jackson's bedroom and Murray's long interview with police detectives two days after Jackson died while in his care. While accepting Murray's account of drugs he gave Jackson, the expert's calculations hinged on the invisible quotient: Jackson's possible movements while his doctor was out of the room. With no witnesses and contradictory physical evidence, that has become the key question hanging over the case. Those who knew the entertainer in his final days offered a portrait of a man gripped by fear that he would not live up to big plans for his comeback concert and worried about his ability to perform if he didn't get sleep. He was plagued by insomnia, and other medical professionals told of his quest for the one drug he believed could help him. He called it his milk , and it was propofol. Jurors have now seen it up close as both Shafer and White demonstrated its potential use as an IV infusion. With White's testimony , the defense sought to answer strong scientific evidence by the prosecution. But they did not address other questions such as allegations that Murray was negligent and acting below the standard of care for a physician. Flanagan, the defense attorney, produced a certificate from Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas showing Murray was certified to administer moderate anesthesia, referred to as conscious sedation. However , the document showed several requirements including that the physician monitor the patient carefully and provide adequate oxygenation and ventilation for a patient that stops breathing. Medical witnesses noted that Murray left his patient alone under anesthesia and did not have adequate equipment to revive him when he found him not breathing. The coroner attributed Jackson's June 25 ,2009, death to acute propofol intoxication complicated by other sedatives. Murray , who had been hired as the singer's personal physician for his This Is It tour , has pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter.  ",

   "input": "TUCSON, Ariz. 2014 Jose Guerena Ortiz was sleeping after an exhausting 12-hour night shift at a copper mine. His wife, Vanessa, had begun breakfast. Their 4-year-old son, Joel, asked to watch cartoons. An ordinary morning was unfolding in the middle-class Tucson neighborhood 2013 until an armored vehicle pulled into the family's driveway and men wearing heavy body armor and helmets climbed out, weapons ready. They were a sheriff's department SWAT team who had come to execute a search warrant. But Vanessa Guerena insisted she had no idea, when she heard a boom and saw a dark-suited man pass by a window , that it was police outside her home. She shook her husband awake and told him someone was firing a gun outside. A U.S. Marine veteran of the Iraq war, he was only trying to defend his family, she said, when he grabbed his own gun 2013 an AR-15 assault rifle. What happened next was captured on video after a member of the SWAT team activated a helmet-mounted camera. The officers 2013 four of whom carried .40-caliber handguns while another had an AR-15 2013 moved to the door, briefly sounding a siren, then shouting Police! in English and Spanish. With a thrust of a battering ram , they broke the door open. Eight seconds passed before they opened fire into the house. And 10 seconds later, Guerena lay dying in a hallway 20-feet from the front door. The SWAT team fired 71 rounds, riddling his body 22 times, while his wife and child cowered in a closet. Hurry up , he's bleeding, Vanessa Guerena pleaded with a 911 operator. I don't know why they shoot him. They open the door and shoot him. Please get me an ambulance. When she emerged from the home minutes later , officers hustled her to a police van, even as she cried that her husband was unresponsive and bleeding, and that her young son was still inside. She begged them to get Joel out of the house before he saw his father in a puddle of blood on the floor. But soon afterward, the boy appeared in the front doorway in Spider-Man pajamas, crying. The Pima County Sheriff's Department said its SWAT team was at the home because Guerena was suspected of being involved in a drug-trafficking organization and that the shooting happened because he arrived at the door brandishing a gun. The county prosecutor's office says the shooting was justified. But six months after the May 5 police gunfire shattered a peaceful morning and a family's life, investigators have made no arrests in the case that led to the raid. Outraged friends, co-workers and fellow Marines have called the shooting an injustice and demanded further investigation. A family lawyer has filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against the sheriff's office. And amid the outcry in online forums and social media outlets, the sheriff's 54-second video, which found its way to YouTube, has drawn more than 275,000 views. The many questions swirling around the incident all boil down to one, repeated by Vanessa Guerena, as quoted in the 1, 000-page police report on the case: Why , why, why was he killed? Outside the family's stucco home , a giant framed photo of Guerena in his Marine uniform sat placed in the front bay window, American flags waved in the yard and signs condemning his death were taped to the garage door. The 27-year-old Guerena had completed two tours in Iraq, and a former superior there was among those who couldn't make sense of his death. Leo Verdugo said Guerena stood out among other Marines for his maturity and sense of responsibility. Verdugo, who retired as a master sergeant last year after 25 years in the Marines, placed Guerena in charge of an important helicopter refueling mission in the remote west desert of Iraq. He had a lot of integrity and he was a man of his word , Verdugo said. Verdugo , who also lives in Tucson, said Guerena came to him for advice in 2006 about whether to retire from the Marines and apply to the Border Patrol. When Verdugo ran into Guerena and his wife at a Motor Vehicle Department office about a month before Guerena was killed, Verdugo said that Guerena told him that the Border Patrol had turned him down because of problems with his vision and that he had instead taken a mining job. Those who worked with Guerena at ASARCO'S Mission Mine said the man they knew would never be a part of drug smuggling. I don't care what the cops say. I don't believe for one moment Jose was involved in anything illegal , said Sharon Hargrave , a co-worker, adding through tears: They were judge , jury and executioner, and there was no excuse. Guerena worked as a helper at two crushers in the mine , shoveling piles of rocks that fall from conveyor belts and wheel-barrowing heavy debris. No one in their right mind would choose this work , which paid about $41,000 a year, if they were bringing in drug smuggling money, Hargrave said. He was a hell of a worker , she said. He's got good judgment and I could trust him. She said Guerena talked constantly about his wife and two sons , Joel and Jose Jr.,5, who'd gone to school the morning of the shooting. I know he was definitely in love with his wife and in love with his kids , she said. Kevin Stephens , a chief steward at Mission mine and head of the miners' union there, said bluntly: Personally , I think he was murdered, and that is the feeling that is out here. But the sheriff's office said just because Guerena was a Marine and worked at a mine doesn't mean he couldn't be involved in drug trafficking. We know from our experiences that good people turn their lives around and do bad things , and this guy was bad irrespective of his honorable discharge as a Marine, said sheriff's chief of investigations Rick Kastigar. He said Guerena was suspected of involvement in a drug operation that specialized in ripping off other smugglers. One tip held that Guerena was the muscle of the organization , or in Kastigar's words, the individual that was directed to exact revenge. An affidavit supporting the search warrant that precipitated the raid describes the department's suspicions about Guerena in a drug investigation that appeared more focused on his brother , and his brother's father-in-law. Guerena's brother does not have a listed number and other family members have ignored written requests from the AP for comment. Sheriff's Capt. Chris Nanos, who heads the criminal investigations division and oversaw the Guerena case, said that high-powered rifles and bulletproof vests that were found in Guerena's home after the shooting back up investigators' belief that Guerena was involved in drug trafficking. A shotgun found in the home was reported stolen in Tucson in 2008. In the affidavit, sheriff's Detective Alex Tisch laid out the case against Guerena's family. It details two instances of drug seizures, one in April 2009 in which Jose Guerena was found in a home with other people who had just dropped off 1,000 pounds of marijuana at a separate residence, and another in October 2009 in which a man who had met with Guerena's brother was found with drugs and weapons. Neither Guerena nor his brother was charged. The affidavit also cites two traffic stops of Jose Guerena. The first was on Jan. 28,2009, when an officer pulled Guerena and two other men over north of Tucson. The officer seized a gun from Guerena, a marijuana pipe from Guerena's cousin and marijuana hidden in canisters of lemonade and hot cocoa that were under the feet of Guerena's friend. The officer arrested Guerena on charges of weapons misconduct, marijuana possession and possession of drug paraphernalia. But prosecutors filed no charges against him. The other stop came Sept. 15,2009, when the sheriff's office pulled over a truck leaving the home of Guerena's brother. Jose Guerena was in the passenger seat and another man was driving. Officers searched the truck and found commercial-sized rolls of plastic wrap that they say are commonly used to package marijuana. No arrests were made. Tisch wrote in the affidavit that the past arrests of Guerena and members of his family, combined with observations during months of surveillance led detectives to believe that the family was operating a mid-level drug-trafficking organization in the Tucson area. The investigation is ongoing, the sheriff's office says. After the SWAT video circulated, people who didn't know Guerena traveled from as far as California to march in protest of his shooting, and an Alaska woman began an online petition calling for a federal investigation of the SWAT team. Hundreds of people across the country have written on several Facebook pages dedicated to Guerena with messages that include, He fought for our country , now we must fight for him. The Guereno family's lawyer , Christopher Scileppi, filed a lawsuit on their behalf seeking damages from the sheriff's office, the officers involved in the shooting and other officials. The lawsuit didn't specify how much money the family was seeking, but a notice of claim filed Aug. 9 put the amount at $20 million. During this investigation , extremely little evidence, if any, was found to raise even a suspicion that Jose Guerena was involved in any possible drug trafficking ring, the notice says. Scileppi said the fact that Guerena had been fired at 71 times and hit 22 times was grotesque , and almost a caricature of an overly excited group of poorly trained law enforcement agents. Kastigar sharply disputed that , calling the Pima County SWAT team one of the best of its kind in the nation. We're not a bunch of country bumpkins in southern Arizona with big bellies and cowboy hats , he said. The shooting was justified , he said, because Guerena pointed his AR-15 at the SWAT officers and said, I've got something for you , before they opened fire. The five SWAT team members who shot Guerena believed that he had fired his weapon first , he said. Subsequent investigation revealed that the gun's safety was on and hadn't been fired. Ultimately, that is not an issue, Kastigar said. What reasonable person comes to the front door and points a rifle at people? he said. It takes several milliseconds to flip the switch from safety to fire and take out a couple of SWAT officers. I'm firmly of the opinion that he was attempting to shoot at us. The officers laid down suppressive fire because one had tripped and fallen and the others thought he'd been shot. You point a gun at police , you're going to get shot, Kastigar said. The five officers who shot Guerena declined to speak to the AP through Mike Storie , a police union lawyer who represents them and defends their actions. Anytime that they are faced with a serious , imminent and deadly threat, they are entitled and justified to use deadly force, he said. And when Guerena came around the corner and lifted an AR-15 and pointed it at them , that provided the justification. An independent expert , Chuck Drago, a former longtime SWAT officer for Fort Lauderdale, Fla., police who now does consulting on use of force and other law enforcement issues, said that the shooting itself appeared justified. It's a horrible , horrible tragedy, but if they walked in the door and somebody came at them with an assault rifle, that would be a justifiable response, said Drago. It doesn't matter whether he's innocent or not. But after examining elements of the search affidavit , Drago questioned whether the sheriff's office truly had probable cause. When you back up and look at why they're there in the first place and whether the search warrant was proper , my mind starts struggling, Drago said. There are a lot of things that don't make a lot of sense.  ",

It is the first time that news came up first since the technology company began publishing its yearly review a decade ago. Vera Chan, the company's senior editor and web trend analyst, said the BP oil spill was the most searched topic for term for a variety of reasons. It became an issue about so many things , such as the environment, energy, workplace disasters and the role of big government. It became a lightning rod for peoples' anxieties, she explained. The World Cup , on the other hand, was searched for as both a sporting event and a cultural experience. People didn't just search for the players and the teams. It was a cultural learning experience. It was the first World Cup in Africa , and people wanted to learn about post-Apartheid South Africa, she said. People also wanted to find out what that noise was -- the vuvuzelas. The list , released on Wednesday, identified the top trends, searches and news items from several categories. All but one of the other top 10 categories reflected public fascination with celebrities. Teen pop sensation Miley Cyrus was in third place in the search rankings and television personality Kim Kardashian was not far behind at fourth place. They were followed by Lady Gaga at No. 5, actress Megan Fox in seventh place, with Justin Bieber, American Idol and Britney Spears completing the top 10. The iPhone stood out as the exception, coming in sixth. Britney Spears continued her fall in the standings, after being knocked down from number 1 to number 5 in 2009, only to land at number 10 in 2010 as rising stars such as Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber become more prominent. How to tie a tie was the No. 1 question in 2010 , followed by how to lose weight , how to kiss and how to write a resume. Unemployment was the most searched for financial item , followed by Wall Street companies and recalls. Yahoo! also released a list of top obsessions , defined which it defined as a person , a pop-culture phenomenon, a political party, a gadget, or a pesty plague that spurred constant online monitoring and obsessive tangential searches. Chan said often these are guilty pleasures and fan favorites not covered in the news. The top obsession of 2010 was the much-anticipated iPhone , followed by actress Lindsay Lohan, the iPad, and the television shows Glee and Jersey Shore. All of these lists together speak a lot about 2010 , and the revolutions in politics and technology of the year, Chan said. (Reporting by Bernd Debusmann Jr. , editing by Patricia Reaney)  ",

   "input": "(CBS) Are silicone breast implants safe? After a two-day meeting that aimed to make sure implant safety studies were legitimate, the FDA has a verdict: Women should feel assured that the F.D.A. continues to believe that currently marketed silicone breast implants are safe , Dr. William Maisel , chief scientist for the FDA's Center for Devices, told the New York Times. We felt that way before the meeting , and we continue to feel that way after the presentations and discussions over the past two days. Consumer groups , including the National Organization for Women Foundation and the National Research Center for Women and Families, had asked the FDA to take Johnson and Johnson's silicone implants - manufactured by its subsidiary Mentor - off the market. They contend the company hadn't provided enough long-term safety data, collecting only 21 percent of three year follow-up data on 40,000 women. Another manufacturer, Allergan, only collected two-year data on its implants from 60 percent of participants. Silicone implants were previously banned for 14 years until 2006, when the FDA approved these two implants. It's unacceptable that many patients Mentor and Allergan were supposed to track were lost , Jan Erickson , spokesperson for the National Organization for Women Foundation, told Reuters. Mentor's approval should be rescinded right away. And Allergan should be required to conduct further studies. The FDA agreed the drug company studies didn't track as many patients as it had hoped , and will work with Mentor and Allergan to complete their studies. Silicone implants are not risk-free. Women may experience ruptures, hardening in the area surrounding the implants, scarring, pain, and infections - some of which may warrant removal. An FDA report in June said as many as one in five women with silicone implants will likely need them removed within 10 years, CBS News reported. Worldwide, five to 10 million women have breast implants. The FDA has more on breast implant safety.  ",

   "input": "From the Green Room to Green Bay, Aaron Rodgers is happy that the sequence of events at the 2005 NFL draft conspired to make him a Packer. Alex Smith is still looking for that kind of happiness with the 49ers. Linked by events beyond their control from that draft, Smith and Rodgers share a bond that goes beyond their position of quarterback. If the wind had blown differently on April 23,2005, Rodgers might be the starting quarterback for the 49ers, set to oppose the Green Bay Packers on Sunday. After enjoying two successful years at Cal, Rodgers was expecting to go in the first round. Many people in the Bay Area were hoping the 49ers, with the No. 1 overall pick, would take him. I'm not going to speak on hypotheticals , Rodgers said. I firmly believe things happen for a reason. I still follow the team. I have a special place in my heart for the San Francisco 49ers. I'm glad I'm in Green Bay and the way my career has gone. I think I was supposed to get picked by Green Bay and go through the experience I did. Instead of Rodgers getting picked first overall by the 49ers , it was Smith, a spread-offense quarterback from Utah. It has taken the 49ers only five years to get back to a style of offense that suits Smith's talents now that he is starting again. Rodgers, meanwhile, sat in the draft's green room in New York for hours, watching such players as Ronnie Brown, Braylon Edwards, Adam Pacman Jones , DeMarcus Ware and Shawne Merriman fly off the board before him. Finally, at 24, the Packers tabbed Rodgers as their quarterback of the future. That's a long process , Smith said. First round takes forever. To be back there in the green room , it's uncomfortable, cameras sitting on you for every pick. Instead of being thrown onto the field as a rookie starter for a team bereft of talent , as Smith was, Rodgers had the luxury of watching and learning from one of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history in Brett Favre. Who knows what could have happened? Smith said. I don't think about that. There's a million different scenarios that could play out. Here we are meeting up five years later. I'll be interested to talk to him about it. We've both taken different routes to be where we are. Smith played in nine games as a rookie and started seven for an eventual 4-12 team. His one touchdown against 11 interceptions serves as a dubious monument to his , and his team's, futility. Green Bay coach Mike McCarthy was San Francisco's offensive coordinator in 2005, the year before the Packers hired him. In a conference call Wednesday, McCarthy said he's against sending out a rookie as a starter if the team is not strong enough to support him. You clearly benefit from sitting back and learning , McCarthy said. If you're going to play your quarterback early , the most important variable is if your team is ready for that, whether it has a strong running game, a strong defense. ... It's not a matter of is your young quarterback ready, is the team ready? Neither Smith nor his team was ready in 2005 and only now , in 2009, is he getting a second chance to prove he's San Francisco's quarterback of the future. Contrast Smith's situation with that of Rodgers, who sat for three years until Favre moved on to the Jets. Rodgers was Favre's backup from 2005 through '07 before becoming the Packers' starter last season. He showed the benefit of watching and learning by passing for 4, 038 yards and 23 touchdowns while 49ers fans were left to ponder what might have been. When you grow up a fan of the team , it never goes away, said Rodgers , a 49ers fan growing up in Chico. I always pay attention to what they're doing. I have a lot of fond memories growing up watching them on TV. Although they were perceived in '05 as rivals competing for draft position , the two quarterbacks are friends and wish each other well. Alex and I are buddies , Rodgers said. The media was trying to pit us against each other like we weren't friends. We're buddies. I pull for him. I'm glad he's getting an opportunity and is doing a good job. It just took a while , for both men.  ",

   "input": "There is no nice way of putting this, but the skyline of London is being screwed. There are now, built and in the pipeline, at least 30 towers, typically in a height range of 150-200 metres (or 490-650 feet. The BT tower is 177 metres high and more slender than anything now proposed). They are the fulfilment of the desires of investors and of the policies of Ken Livingstone, pursued with equal vigour by Boris Johnson, even though he once promised to take a tougher line on height. With minimum discussion, proposals are being waved through the planning system 2013 and while both the mayor of London and the communities secretary, Eric Pickles, have the power to intervene in major decisions, neither has done so. A decade ago, plans for buildings such as the Shard and the Gherkin were widely publicised, provoked debate and were the subject of public inquiries. Now, developers and architects hold modest public exhibitions in the immediate neighbourhood of their proposals and are not overanxious that they should be more widely known about. Developers have long represented their projects with flattering, shiny visualisations that greatly over-estimate the seductive power of their cladding systems, which are bathed in an eternally golden glow. Now some of them have a new strategy, which is to act is if they are not there at all: sometimes, on their websites, you get views of plazas strewn with caf 00e9 tables, and pastel-coloured ground plans, and little clue of the large objects that will rise over their heads. If many of the proposals shown on these pages are new to you, that could be because their makers are so reticent about designs which, when built, will be anything but. Last month, another clutch was approved. Almost all forms of resistance, such as the statutory bodies that are supposed to guide the planning system, have been neutralised, leaving only little-heard neighbourhood groups to voice their protests. All of which, if these tall buildings were making the capital into a great metropolis of the 21st century, might be a cause for celebration. Towers can be beautiful, and part of the genius of London is its ability to change, but what we are getting now are mostly units of speculation stacked high, garnished with developers' ego. They are invitations to tax evaders to park their cash in Britain. What is happening now is the culmination of 15 years or more of gathering pressure to build high. In the 1990s, plans were first unveiled for what would eventually be the Gherkin, controversially built on the site of the Baltic Exchange, a building that was listed but also damaged by an IRA bomb. It was eventually decided that, if this building were designed by a celebrated architect, such as Lord Foster, and were an exceptional work of architecture, other planning issues could be overridden. When Livingstone was elected mayor in 2000, he enthusiastically supported tall buildings. He dined with developers in private, at a huge property junket in Cannes called Mipim, and publicly announced his grand bargain with capital: they should be allowed to build as big as they wanted, as long as he could take a tithe of the proceeds to spend on such things as affordable housing. He produced a London plan, which encouraged, among other things, building high around major transport interchanges, so as to encourage the users of these buildings to use public transport. It was all part of Livingstone's then vision that the future of London lay in the never-ending boom in financial services, with which a socialist mayor could cut a deal. It was repeatedly said that, following the precedent of the Gherkin, tall buildings should be of the highest architectural quality and also in the right place , two principles that would turn out to have flexible meanings. The Shard was proposed, and being by the celebrated Renzo Piano and having a certain classiness in its form, was approved following a public inquiry. It has a substantial impact on St Paul's Cathedral, when seen from Hampstead Heath, a view recognised by planning policy as significant, but not seen as reason enough to stop it. In 2005, Lord Rogers, once a business partner of both Piano and Foster, won permission for the 225-metre Leadenhall Building, or Cheesegrater, in the City of London. Encouraged by these precedents, further proposals popped up, with increasingly tenuous claims to be of the highest architectural quality or in the right place. They were not just in the City of London, but also south of the river in Southwark, Waterloo and Vauxhall. The 180-metre Vauxhall Tower (the St George Wharf tower to its developers) was proposed, smack in the middle of a view from Westminster Bridge, officially deemed to be important and requiring special care. There was not much evidence of special care in the design. It went to a public inquiry, in which the inquiry's inspector concluded that it should not be built. John Prescott, however, who was then the minister responsible for such things, used his powers to overrule this advice. This tower is now being built, its exterior nearly complete. In the City of London, planning officer Peter Rees long treasured the idea that tall buildings should be in a cluster , collectively forming a roughly conical shape that would rise to its peak close to the Bank of England. But then came the Walkie Talkie , officially called 20 Fenchurch Street, an office block designed by Rafael Vi 00f1oly, whose brilliant concept perfectly captured the money-worshipping zeitgeist of the pre-crash years: it gets fatter as it rises, to reflect the fact that floor area becomes more valuable the higher you go. The Walkie Talkie, whose frame is now rising, is by no stretch of the imagination inside this cluster, but Rees somehow persuaded himself that it is in the right place. On the South Bank , the 140-metre Doon Street tower was proposed. Another public inquiry was held and refusal recommended. Hazel Blears, who by then had inherited Prescott's mantle, like him decided she knew better and approved it. Construction is under way. In Elephant and Castle, the 148-metre Strata SE1 was built, which would be the winner of the 2010 Carbuncle Cup, awarded by Building Design magazine to the worst building of the year. Another view considered worthy of protection by planning policy is of the Houses of Parliament seen from the Serpentine Bridge in Hyde Park, its gothic spires framed by trees and water. Here, Strata waddles into the background from stage left, like SpongeBob SquarePants in a production of Hamlet. It is not in the right place either. There was a pause following the crash and the election of Johnson in 2008 , whose mayoral campaign had included promises to be less tower-friendly than Livingstone. However, although he has the power to refuse significant planning applications, he has not once done so. Rather, he chose to approve the 237-metre Columbus Tower in Canary Wharf, reversing the decision by the London borough of Tower Hamlets to reject it. A new wave of proposals has come forward. An application will be submitted shortly for new towers next to the Shell Centre, near Waterloo station, with every expectation of being successful, and two more are planned at Elephant and Castle. Several have been approved near to the Vauxhall Tower, which a few years ago was considered impactful enough to require the inquiry in which the inspector found against it. Some of its new neighbours will be higher and not obviously more beautiful, while their collective effect will be much bulkier, but neither Johnson nor Pickles is using his authority to give pause to the process: at least half of the developments we picture in our gallery have been approved in the Boris era. And so it goes on. Policies are framed that, generous to start with, are then stretched far beyond any reasonable interpretation of what they might mean. Rules are made, then broken. It is doubtful, for example, whether Vauxhall is a major transport interchange of the kind that the London plan thinks is right for tall buildings, but it is becoming a mini Dubai nonetheless. Developments in the same area are supposed to follow a masterplan drawn up by Sir Terry Farrell, but when he pointed out that two proposed towers by Michael Squire broke its principles, they got permission anyway. Notions such as the highest architectural quality , to quote Johnson's version of the London plan, are rapidly debased. At one point, tower proposals felt the need to proclaim their sustainability, with ostentatious wind turbines included in the designs for the Vauxhall Tower and Strata (where, to be sure, they are almost never seen to turn). Now, developers don't even bother with these. Older applications, including the Walkie Talkie, proposed viewing galleries that, although they would actually be privately controlled, were called public spaces. Again , these are no longer on offer. Recently, the developers of the 163-metre One Blackfriars successfully applied to have their once-promised viewing gallery omitted. London has a multilayered planning system, in which borough councils make decisions and the mayor and minister can then overrule them. Bodies such as English Heritage and the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (Cabe) advise and public inquiries can be held. Yet these layers, while retaining the ability to complicate and slow things down, no longer do their job of revision and review. Willingly or not, they have been disempowered. English Heritage has opposed several tower proposals, but after many losing battles (which, due to the cost of planning lawyers, were also expensive) its objections are now reduced to demoralised bat-squeaks. Although, for example, it thinks that proposals in Vauxhall will cause substantial harm to the setting of the Westminster world heritage site , it did not even issue a press release on the subject. Cabe, a watchdog ever fond of nuzzling the developers it was supposed to be watching, has been shrunk and further enfeebled. Even when it summons up the courage to state the bleeding obvious, such as the fact that the Quill, a risible block of student housing next to the Shard, is poorly designed, Cabe is ignored. At the relevant meeting of Southwark council's planning committee, an officer reported that Cabe supported it, even though it had said it did not. This provoked guffaws from the public gallery. It doesn't help that boroughs such as Southwark and Lambeth are unlikely to be tough on new towers, as they can order developers to contribute planning gain , which is money to be spent on affordable housing elsewhere in their territory. Livingstone liked them for similar reasons, as well us for the special delight that skyscrapers seem to have for mayors. Johnson is likely to be influenced by the community infrastructure levy raised on new developments, which helps pay for the Crossrail project. Of course, affordable housing and public transport are good things to have, but thoughtless plunder of the city's airspace is not the way to pay for them; by the same argument, we could build on parks or on the river. The results of these shoddy processes will be visible all over the capital, in the background of famous buildings, from hills and parks, down the ends of streets. They will change the Thames, bringing a completely different scale to its banks. None of which need be a problem, if they conformed to the official planning line that tall buildings should be well designed and in the right place. Or, to quote Johnson's policy, that they should form cohesive building groups , contribute positively to the image and built environment of London and be resisted in areas that will be particularly sensitive to their impacts. What is a world heritage site if not the latter? On the question of being well designed , the supporters of these towers will produce the well-worn arguments that design is subjective, that St Paul's was derided in its day and so on. One could, however, look for what might be thought qualities of good design and usually they will be hard to find. Do they, for example, show consideration of scale or proportion or try to make a meaningful relationship with their surroundings? Is there anything special about their detail? Is there consistency or integrity in their overall concept? Do they create handsome new public spaces at their base? Does their internal planning produce the best possible living or working spaces, which are well laid out and make good use of daylight? Failing all the above, do they have any worth in the rapidly debasing currency of iconicity? Are they, in other words, exhilarating to contemplate or innovative 2013 do they transmit some sort of buzzy excitement about London being a dynamic world city? I would suggest that, if that's what you want, Shanghai and Dubai do it better. The Shard and the Gherkin, conceived early in the current tower boom, are impressive, going on magnificent, albeit with major defects 2013 I defy you to stand at the base of either and say that you are in a world-class public space. But it turns out that they were as good is it gets. To take the Vauxhall Tower as an example, it makes no apparent effort to form any kind of relationship with its surroundings, neither a Georgian house behind it, nor even St George Wharf, an existing development by the same architects as the tower, Broadway Malyan, and the same developers, St George. It does not relate to the river in any particular way or, in longer views, to the Palace of Westminster. It is just there, sullenly uncommunicative. It seemingly wants to be a slender cylinder, but contradicts itself with a sawtooth plan. At the top, it changes its mind again and adopts a stepped, zigguraty form. At the bottom, it is something else again and there is little attempt to reconcile the various elements. Its cladding is an ordinary-looking glazing package. Around its foot is precisely the sort of shapeless, windswept, nothing place that we were supposed to have learned not to do in the 1970s. There are some honourable exceptions, with purveyors of rectilinear dignity doing better than those attempting artistic flourishes. Allies and Morrison's 100 Bishopsgate is an example or David Chipperfield's Elizabeth House at Waterloo station, the result of a rare occasion on which the developers were pushed to improve their initial ideas. They would have every right to be furious, having made an expensive effort with this project, at the easy ride given to other proposals. Others 2013 Strata, the future towers at Vauxhall and Nine Elms 2013 tend to follow their own, similar patterns. They offer a paltry public realm of Chinese granite and Costa coffee , standard glazing, a few loops and convulsions, like a dad at a disco, suggesting that they are bit on wild side. They don't bother at all to work with their neighbours to make a three-dimensional entity. There is no vision, concept or thought as to what their total effect might be on London, except that it will be great. In planning a kitchen, it is usual to envisage the totality before you start, but a great city has not been granted this courtesy. The onus should be on those who want to make such large changes, and to profit from them, to demonstrate their quality - the more conspicuous a building the more important it is that it is well-designed. As it is, they would rather we didn't notice them until it's too late.  ",

   "input": "Streetscape: examples of Melbourne graffiti. Melbourne is the proud capital of street painting with stencils. Its large, colonial-era walls and labyrinth of back alleys drip with graffiti that is more diverse and original than any other city in the world. Well, that was until a few weeks ago, when preparations for the Commonwealth games brought a tidal wave of grey paint, obliterating years of unique and vibrant culture overnight. This may seem like no great tragedy to readers of the Daily Mail, but Melbourne's graffiti scene is a key factor in its status as the continent's hothouse of creativity and wilful individualism. Melbourne became a hub of stencilling for reasons no one seems particularly able to explain. Its laid-back atmosphere and sense of isolation most probably have something to do with it. Painters there have never been as shackled to the New York school of large letters on subway trains that took a stranglehold everywhere else. Rather than scrawling their name across a window, most preferred to paint something a little different: a dog chasing a butterfly on a mailbox, for instance, or a couple kissing in the space left where an old poster has been ripped away. Witty, playful, often angry, the free rein taken by Melbourne's street artists became about much more than just daubing on a wall. It has drawn in generations of artists, thinkers and tourists to explore and experiment in the city. It gave fresh life to the worlds of fashion and music and is arguably Australia's most significant contribution to the arts since they stole all the Aborigines' pencils. The Melbourne scene is incredibly diverse , says Alison Young , head of the department of criminology at Melbourne University. The range of artists includes people in their 40s , in their teens and a relatively large number of women. Young was commissioned by the city council to draw up a draft graffiti strategy last March in which she recommended tolerance zones be set up where street art and graffiti be allowed a small space within the city , where writers and artists would be at a lower risk of being arrested. This was rejected by the city council , despite it generating lots of public support and despite evidence being presented that zero tolerance, for lots of reasons, wouldn't work. Instead , the council doubled its anti-graffiti budget. The clean-up is an imposition of a supposedly mainstream , or dominant, cultural view, says Young , in denial of the diversity of cultural styles that actually exist within a city space. What is disappointing about the authority's attitude is that Australia is probably still the only country in the world to have elevated a graffiti writer to the status of national public hero. Arthur Stace was an alcoholic from the slums of Sydney who found God while listening to a Baptist preacher in a hostel in the 1940s and took to writing the word eternity on the ground in chalk. He rendered it in meticulous copperplate script more than half a million times across Sydney over the next three decades , becoming an urban legend before his death in 1967 at the age of 83. He has since been honoured by a plaque, a range of council-approved merchandise and was the centrepiece of celebrations when the word eternity in his trademark hand was lit up in 100ft-high letters on Sydney harbour bridge to mark the new millennium. Then came the Commonwealth games and a redoubling of the city's efforts to rid itself of the evil graffiti menace. Cleaning crews have been at work all along the main railway line that runs from the centre of the city to the main sporting venue for the games , destroying miles of continuous artwork, says Jake Smallman , who has edited a recent book called Stencil Graffiti Capital: Melbourne, compiling some of the city's more inventive street art. In February, police were rumoured to have infiltrated an exhibition showcasing photographs from the book as part of an intelligence-gathering exercise. Graffiti's not art , said the police minister Tim Holding , in response to the book. It's vandalism and it's something we all deplore. Melbourne's innovative painting scene has been a key player in the global development of street art in recent years. Rather bizarrely for an art form that requires a casual interpretation of the law , graffiti has been steeped in rules and conservatism ever since Taki 183 picked up a can of Krylon spray paint in New York in the 1970s. A strict code was soon established that decreed what a piece should consist of and how many you needed to paint to achieve a certain status. It is only since the omnipresence of tags (graffiti signatures) has turned them into a kind of forgettable urban wallpaper that the art form has started to evolve again. Modern street art is the product of a generation tired of growing up with a relentless barrage of logos and images being thrown at their head every day, and much of it is an attempt to pick up these visual rocks and throw them back. The street art destroyed in Melbourne will survive on graffiti's new best friend - the internet. The web has done wonders for graffiti; it perfectly reflects its transient nature, and graffiti is ludicrously overrepresented on its pages. The ability to photograph a street piece that may last for only a few days and bounce it round the world to an audience of millions has dramatically improved its currency. On the other hand, the internet is turning graffiti into an increasingly virtual pastime. It is now possible to achieve notoriety by painting elaborate pieces in secluded locations, without the associated risk of arrest that is usually attached. By posting photographs online you can become a significant graffiti writer from a town where none of your work is actually visible. The precedent set by Melbourne does not bode well for London in the build-up to the 2012 Olympics. The games will be set in east London, where Hackney is one of the few remaining parts of the city where affordable studio space for artists still exists. After the warehouses have been flattened by compulsory purchase orders, the pots of grey paint will be opened and an area rich in street culture and frontier spirit will disappear. Factory doors whose flaked layers of Hammerite reveal history like the rings in a tree stump will be thrown on the fire. Disused cranes perched on top of foundries like skeletal crows will be torn down. Everything will be replaced by a cardboard-partitioned village perched on a pile of cheap laminate flooring. And if you think the graffiti will be removed so it can be replaced by vistas of clean urban space, think again. Every meaningful spot will be clogged with giant billboards by the likes of McDonald's encouraging you to get fit by staying at home and watching the games on TV. This is not to say that every city should aim to look like the south Bronx, or that regeneration cannot be a good thing, but society's headlong march into bland conformity should not necessarily be welcomed with such open arms. In the 1990s, large sections of football grounds were demolished to make way for executive boxes - only then did people start to complain about the lack of atmosphere. Melbourne and London are genuine epicentres of the skewed human touch that can bring a little sparkle into the drudgery of public space. A feat that is of immense value, despite its apparent worthlessness. And a feat that is not so easily achieved by trying to run around a track in under four minutes.  ",

Henriquez 2019s idea was pitted against other proposed projects seeking funding from employees in the IT group. Each of the more than 300 participants 2014 from entry-level workers to vice presidents 2014 received $2,000 to invest over an eight-week period. Then, through the crowdfunding system, Henriquez managed to raise a total of $20,0, and after a few months of development and testing, project managers started using his app. The experience was empowering for Henriquez, who is based in Bratislava, Slovakia. 201cI don 2019t feel like I work for IBM; I feel like this is my company, 201d he said. That 2019s music to the ears of IBM executives who hope the iFundIT project will engage employees and spark more innovation from the bottom up. Employee engagement is a pressing issue for most companies these days. In a study of 142 countries, Gallup found that only 13% of employees worldwide are engaged in their work. The percentages vary widely by nation, with 30% of workers in America saying they are engaged; 24% in Australia; 17% in the UK; 15% in Germany; 9% in India; and just 6% in China. One possible solution to this problem: more egalitarian workplaces where employees feel they have more control over decisions, such as IBM 2019s iFundIT program. 201cCompanies need to be more compatible with this democratic age of the Internet and social media that we live in now, 201d said Traci Fenton, chief executive officer of St. Louis and London-based WorldBlu, which provides consulting services for creating 201cfreedom-centred 201d workplaces. 201cOrganisational democracy means decentralizing power and recognising that good ideas are everywhere in the workplace. 201d Seeking employee input may slow some types of decision-making, but Fenton believes it could speed up the execution process because workers would feel more invested after having their say. 201cOf course, companies only want to do this if they 2019re sure they 2019re going to act on a group decision, 201d she said. 201cIf they don 2019t follow through, they 2019ve done more harm than good. 201d WorldBlu compiles an annual list of the world 2019s 201cmost democratic workplaces 201d based on such factors as being transparent and accountable, sharing power, and giving employees meaningful choices. The biggest obstacles to workplace democracy are executive ego and ignorance, Fenton said. 201cSome people simply don 2019t want to give up control; others fear what they don 2019t understand, 201d she said. A democratic workplace has cross-generational appeal, although IBM believes its crowdfunding project will especially resonate with millennials, who are used to airing their views in blogs and social media and believe they deserve to be heard at work, too. Millennials is a term used to describe the generation of people born between about 1980 and 2000. Some companies with a small workforce are going even further and giving employees a voice in some very major decisions. When DreamHost 2019s founders decided in 2011 to recruit the first CEO for the Los Angeles-based Web hosting firm, they let employees vote on the finalists. More recently, its 165 workers voted on the company 2019s health benefits plan. 201cWe feel that by letting our employees make the decision after they know how much different benefit packages will cost, we 2019re empowering them and encouraging them to stay with the company, 201d said Ed Wesley, director of organisational development and learning. 201cIt takes guts to be democratic and give employees more control, but the payoff is happiness and engagement. 201d Companies like DreamHost and Menlo Innovations, a software company in Ann Arbor, Michigan, also are opening the financial books to their employees to guide their decision-making. 201cOur goal is for the staff to make decisions about where we spend money, but they need to understand the big financial picture of the company first, 201d said Rich Sheridan, the CEO at Menlo, which has about 50 full-time and temporary workers. Already, Menlo gets 15 to 25 workers involved in assessing a job candidate as he or she goes through interviews and tryouts. 201cWe work in pairs so we want to see evidence of kindergarten skills, whether they can play well with our employees, 201d Sheridan said. Of course, it 2019s easier to democratise small businesses than multinationals with thousands of workers scattered around the globe. But IBM shows that even a company with more than 430,000 employees in 170 countries can give at least some of them more decision-making authority. 201cWe need to flatten the organisation; not every investment decision has to be made by a director or vice president, 201d said Francoise LeGoues, the head of IBM 2019s CIOLab and creator of iFundIT. 201cWe want collaborative innovation. How do we ensure that young people 2019s ideas get attention and that someone in Bangalore connects with someone in New York? 201d Eligible projects must be related to internal information technology, although they could also be applied to products, such as IBM 2019s social software platform for businesses. 201cIt has to be a small project, 201d LeGoues said. 201cThese won 2019t be large, multi-year projects like a redesign of the entire HR system, for example. 201d About 160 projects were submitted during the first two crowdfunding rounds this year, with 20 reaching their funding target of between $10,000 and $30,000. Funded projects included Influence of Communities from China (search results based on influence, not popularity) and reMap from the UK (a collaborative outlining tool to organise and share information across teams of all sizes). 201cThe level of excitement and participation has surprised me, 201d LeGoues said. 201cPeople have even begun running internal campaigns to try to get others to spend money on their projects. This is really a game changer in the way people think about what it means to be an IBMer. 201d Follow BBC Capital on Twitter @BBC_Capital or join the conversation about this or any other Capital story on Facebook: BBC Capital on Facebook.

   "input": "I opened Twitter this morning to find two things trending: Comic Sans, and Higgs boson 2013 the former a much-hated font , and the latter something to do with science. As unlikely as it sounds, the two things were linked. Scientists announcing the discovery of this Higgs boson thing had written up their complex findings in the childish font everyone loves to hate. At first, I thought Twitter had misdiagnosed the font. There are lots of scripts out there that look a bit like Comic Sans; I hubristically like to think I can tell them apart, and at first glance this one looked more like Chalkboard, or Captain Comic. But after blowing up a screengrab on Photoshop, 10 minutes of close analysis revealed that, yes, this was Comic Sans after all. The awkward serif on the capital c was a dead giveaway. Predictably , Twitter was outraged. Dear @CERN , wrote one science buff with a taste for typography. Every time you use Comic Sans on a powerpoint , God kills the Schr 00f6dinger's cat. Please think of the cat. Another groaned: They used Comic Sans on the Higgs boson powerpoint presentation 2026 Nope there is no hope for mankind. This kind of reaction is nothing new. While researching a feature about Comic Sans two years ago , I spoke to many people with a visceral hatred for the font. According to Holly Combs, a designer who founded the Ban Comic Sans movement, using it in most contexts is a bit like turning up to a black-tie event in a clown costume. On a purely aesthetic level , says typographer Paul Barnes , who co-designed the Guardian's font library, Comic Sans is not a particularly well-crafted letterform. In one sense , you can see where its critics are coming from, particularly in the context of atomic physics. You could argue that it's bizarre to juxtapose inscrutable words like maximum deviation from background-only expectation observed for m ~126 GeV with a font originally designed for a children's computer program. But I wouldn't make that argument. If ever there was an announcement that needed to be made in Comic Sans , I think it's this one. Comic Sans may be over-used, it may look silly, and it may have been designed in a hurry. But it's also very legible, and tests have shown that it makes complex information easier to understand. There's a reason it's used by dyslexia coaches: it facilitates reading. We joke about how inscrutable the research at Cern is, so why make it seem even more austere? Yes, the Higgs boson is a serious business 2013 but that's all the more reason to communicate it in as friendly and accessible a way as possible. Graphic design doesn't have to be elaborate; at its best it communicates information quickly and simply. And the chaps at Cern have understood that better than most of the font snobs out there.  ",

Test Text1 underline It's the high school he said she said that rocked a small town about a night of partying, drinking and sex that made national headlines. We have heard her version of what went on. But tonight, for the very first time, his version. That senior high school football player on interrogation tapes, just obtained by 20 20. Will hearing his words change what you think about the story? Or outrage you even more? Here's Matt Gutman. You have the right to remain silent. Reporter: This is 17-year-old Matt Barnett sitting in a police interrogation room. Did you understand these rights as I've explained them to you? Yes , sir. Reporter: And this is daisy Coleman, whose life changed forever because of what happened between them. Two teens facing tough repercussions for a night of mistakes. You had a lot of young people that made a lot of bad decisions, and they ended up getting caught. Reporter: 14-year-old daisy Coleman. Sexual assault charges. A high-school sexual assault case is making headlines once again. Reporter: The pair were at the center of an alcohol-fueled teenage sex scandal that gripped the nation and divided a community. Bad judgment calls. For everyone. Reporter: Daisy is the face you almost never see, the teenage victim shedding anonymity to speak out. I really wish more girls would tell their story. Reporter: It all began in maryville, Missouri, an all-american town full of cows and cornfields, where football is king and it's players royalty. And perhaps none more popular than Matt Barnett, a tall broad-shouldered defensive end for the maryville spoofhounds. Cheering him on, a beaming and bubbly 14-year-old daisy. The two began exchanging texts. She's a freshman, Matt a senior in the cool crowd of athletes, along with daisy's oldest brother Charlie. Here they are together at prom. But Charlie was concerned with all that flirty texting. I told him, I was like, Quit texting my sister. Reporter: He didn't stop texting your sister? No. And I told her stop. And I was like , Listen , he's a senior. You're a freshman. You're my little sister. You can't be talking' to him. Well she didn't listen. Reporter: No daisy didn't. Something she would later regret. One frigid January evening daisy was having a sleepover with her friend , a 13-year-old girl named Paige. She just came over, we started watching scary movies. Reporter: They say they also started drinking, sneaking alcohol from daisy's mother's closet. I was in high school and everyone was already doing it. So I was like, Oh , I might as well try this. Reporter: That night daisy was also texting Matt. Here for the first time are some of those messages the pair arranging to meet. Lol. U wanna come drink wit me and chill. Omg. He asked to hang out. So we snuck out of my house around one , and he drove us to his house, and he had to sneak us through his basement window. Reporter: And into Matt's bedroom seen here. Also at the house were four other popular boys. Among them, some of Charlie's best friends. Those were the guys I was with every single day. Reporter: You could've trusted them like a brother and you'd hope that you could've trusted them with your sister. Yeah, I hoped. They kind of egged me on to drink from this really tall shot glass. Reporter: These are photos of the aftermath of the party obtained by ABC news. Trash, empty plastic cups, and a bottle of bacardi. The boys at the party at night estimate that daisy drank 5 to 10 shots in a 15-minute span. Everything after that was just black. And that's all I remember. Reporter: She might not remember, but Matt does. This video, Matt's police interrogation, is the first time ever we get to hear from Matt Barnett himself. Did she ever say she didn't want to have sex with you? No. Reporter: His words providing new key clues in what could have happened that night between him and daisy. So you and daisy had sex in your room? Yes. This is before she started drinking at my house. Reporter: Central to case, the timing of when exactly daisy downed all those drinks. Was she drunk out of her mind? When I was with her, when we were having sex, no. Reporter: Matt Barnett tells police their sex was consensual and that daisy only drank to excess afterwards. When you picked her up at her house, was she drunk? I wouldn't say drunk, I'd say she was -- Buzzed? Yeah, buzzed. Then you took her home, you and her talked, you had sex. Then she came out after having sex, wanted to have another shot. Yeah. Reporter: Critical point in the investigation that followed because in Missouri, a 14-year-old girl can't consent to sex if she's incaps tated. And tonight, never before heard accounts from the other boys present that night. Like Jordan Zech. And then they went back into the bedroom and had sex again? No, Matt said he didn't have sex with her the 2nd time because he couldn't get a . Reporter: Paige, who was waiting in another room, describes her friend daisy as completely wasted and couldn't even walk. And they just started panicking a lot, saying How are we going to get her dropped off , without her brothers waking up, without them hearing us. So they brought us back to the house and dropped her off. And then just put her in the yard , and they told me to go back inside and that she'd be fine, she just had to sober up. Reporter: All the while, Melinda Coleman thought her daughter was safely asleep in bed all night long. It was 5:00 A.M. When daisy was discovered. The dogs started barking which woke mom up and my youngest brother. And she had just sweat pants and a t-shirt on. Her hair was wet and frozen. And then I was woken up to, Charlie , wake up. Wake up, Charlie. There's something wrong. Reporter: Daisy had been abandoned on the lawn for almost three hours wearing no shoes or socks. It was terrifying. I couldn't understand why she was outside. Reporter: Melinda says she thought maybe daisy had been sleep walking. But when she put daisy in the bathtub to warm her up , she noticed marks on her body. I asked her if she was hurting and she kind of said yes, and started crying. So my brother and I went in the yard and found a phone, started Reading these messages from Matty. Reporter: Did you instantly know what happened? I instantly knew there was something going on. The last message on there was, I'll be there in a minute. And I was -- I was so mad. And then I took her in to the emergency room. The doctor said that she had been raped. And it was definitely my worst fears. I , as a mom I just -- it just hurt so much and you want to take the pain away. And I think I knew what she was going to go through. Reporter: Barnett was arrested for sexual assault. And to Melinda's dismay the charges were quickly dropped. And daisy's life began to completely unravel. She was suspended from cheerleading after admitting to drinking and was bullied at school. People would generally just yell stuff. Like, they would yell Liar or the S word , or they would call me the W word. Reporter: Things got so bad , the colemans say they were forced to move. But that didn't stop the digital onslaught. The stuff on Facebook and Twitter was just unbelievable, so horrible. Saying stuff like, Why don't you slit your wrists. I began self-harming , and I was very suicidal, and I really started to hate myself. Reporter: Daisy was down, but her mom Melinda wouldn't let her be silenced. They embarked on a national media campaign. And I think they need to let him pay at least some price and some punishment, so he can learn. Justice for daisy! Reporter: And Melinda ignited a firestorm back home, trying to get justice for daisy and for other girls afraid to speak out. Supporters held daisies and lit candles to represent the alleged victim. Reporter: A special prosecutor was brought in to take a fresh look at the case and those previously sealed interrogation tapes. How long do you think you and her were in the bedroom together? Like 15 minutes to 20 minutes. Reporter: After a ten-week investigation, this past January, the final word. Today Mr. Barnett pleads guilty to endangering a child in the second degree. Reporter: That was for leaving daisy on her lawn. But as for rain charges -- There was insufficient evidence to go forward on a sexual assault. Reporter: Vindication for Matt Barnett, cleared by two independent investigations. Proof he says that he did not sexual assault daisy. Did the girl you had sex with ever say she didn't want to?

Boston documentary filmmaker Michael Sheridan believes that, too, which is why in 2010 he founded Community Supported Film to train grass-roots documentary filmmakers across the globe. CSF 2019s first effort was the 201cAfghan Project, 201d resulting in 10 short films that were compiled into 201cThe Fruit of Our Labor: Afghan Perspectives in Film. 201d It was shown to political leaders, students, and communities across the United States and in Afghanistan. Now, Sheridan and CSF have launched 201cHaitian Perspectives in Film, 201d which will train and mentor 10 Haitian directors who hope to influence the way their country is portrayed in documentaries. Sheridan, a Boston native who cofounded Oxfam America 2019s documentary production unit in the 1990s and who has taught documentary filmmaking at Northeastern University, Massachusetts College of Art and Design, and the former Boston Film and Video Foundation, says he 2019s been 201cfrustrated by the tenor of the conversation 201d in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti.

CSF has partnered with award-winning Haitian journalist Ralph Thomassaint Joseph, who will oversee local training of young filmmakers who will produce 10 short films. These films will focus on the economic and social development challenges Haitians have faced since the 2010 earthquake, says Sheridan, who recently returned from a trip to Haiti and plans to go back in the fall.

A record-breaking 100 million viewers is the target audience advertisers dream about. One entrepreneur I talked with this week doesn 2019t have the big bucks (close to $3 million) to buy a 30-second spot on Super Bowl XLIV. But Randy Hetrick, the founder of a hot little company called Fitness Anywhere, has a vested interest in the New Orleans Saints beating the Indianapolis Colts. That 2019s because Saints quarterback Drew Brees is an investor in Fitness Anywhere. And the company 2019s product, a suspension-strap strength-training system called TRX, had something to do with Brees 2019 stunning comeback from serious injury a few years ago. First, a bit about TRX 2019s odd origin. Hetrick, who is now 44, was a Navy SEAL 2013one of those elite special-ops military agents who conducts clandestine warfare. A lifetime super-jock, he got really frustrated inside ships and submarines and other tight quarters where he was unable to exercise. So he concocted a harness system 2014initially out of parachute webbing stitched together by boat repair tools 2013so he could use his own body weight as resistance against gravity. Hetrick 2019s fellow SEALs took to using the harness system, and they invented a dozen exercises for it. But it wasn 2019t until Hetrick quit the SEALs, after 14 years, and went on to Stanford Business School that it dawned on him that his training gizmo could lead to his next career. Working out at the gym at Stanford, he realized that the exercise system was a hit with the strength trainers and other fitness fanatics too. 201cThat 2019s when I thought, 2018I wonder if there 2019s a business in this, 201d he says. Hetrick left Stanford, MBA in tow, in 2003 and spent the next couple of years lining up investors (he 2019s raised $6 million in debt and equity) and manufacturers and customers for the product he called TRX 2013for total resistance exercise. His biggest misstep early on, he says, was trying to sell mainly into specialty retail stores. 201cThe retail channel is brutal on the little guy, 201d he explains. 201cThey 2019re not interested in untested product. And they 2019re utterly savage in terms of margin. 201d So he scratched that strategy and decided to target what he calls 201cpro-sumers. 201d These are coaches and pro athletes and other influential folks in athletic world who will spread the word about his product and help get TRX distributed in colleges and pro teams and health clubs. Enter Drew Brees in 2006. Brees started using the TRX trainer after he had surgery to repair a torn labrum and partially torn rotator cuff in his right shoulder, his throwing arm. 201cI 2019m addicted, 201d Brees told Sports Illustrated about the TRX trainer. To Hetrick and Fitness Anywhere, that endorsement was as valuable as any ad on the Super Bowl. Since then, a slew of pro teams have adopted the TRX system for training: the San Francisco 49ers and Pittsburgh Steelers in football, the Denver Nuggets and Boston Celtics in basketball, and the Detroit Tigers and Philadelphia Phillies in baseball. Golfer Phil Mickelson and swimmers Michael Phelps and Natalie Coughlin are TRX users, according to Fitness Anywhere. And TRX is big in mixed martial arts, used by the champs of the UFC, Ultimate Fighting. Another user is Bob Damon, the North American president of search firm Korn Ferry International , who introduced me to Hetrick. Damon is what Hetrick calls a 201cfitnatic 201d 2013a lifetime super-jock who takes on fitness as a sport and seriously competes against himself. Damon, who travels plenty, packs the TRX Suspension Training Pro Pack, weighing 1.5 pounds, in his suitcase and attaches it to hotel-room doors to work out on the road. Damon invested in Fitness Anywhere two years ago. Brees invested last year. Hetrick says that Brees, is the unusual sports superstar who takes executive education classes in the off-season. Last summer, Hetrick ran into Brees at Stanford and Brees asked him, 201cIs it too late? Can I invest? 201d Hetrick accepted Brees 2019 money, gladly, and says that 2019s the end of fund-raising for Firness Anywhere for the foreseeable future. The San Francisco-based company did about $15 million in revenues last year, and CEO Hetrick expects to more than double that in 2010. Right now, he 2019s awaiting some big orders from the Department of Defense, already a major customer. 201cProfitability is liberating, 201d Hetrick says, noting that his start-up made a profit for the first time last year. He 2019s feeling a lot less body-resistance, business-wise at least, than he used to.  ",

   "input": "The studio that created the popular Halo video game franchise is leaving Microsoft (MSFT) to gain creative freedom, potentially delivering a blow to the software giant 2019s image among gamers. Halo is the most popular software franchise for Microsoft 2019s Xbox 360 console, and it achieved $300 million in sales in the week after Halo 3 was released on September 25. Because the game is exclusive to the Xbox platform, it helped boost hardware sales for Microsoft; the Xbox 360 also beat the Nintendo Wii in sales last week for the first time this year. Microsoft confirmed the split in a press release this morning . Rumors of a split between Microsoft and game studio Bungie had been circulating on gaming enthusiast sites for several days, after 8BitJoystick broke the story on a Seattle Post Intelligencer blog . The blog writer said he got this e-mail tip: So heres my big secret. You should google Bungie + Microsoft + separation this week. You know that big ol BILLION dollar franchise Bungie has created for Microsoft, to show their appreciate Microsoft is letting Bungie leave. Of course Microsoft gets to keep all rights to the Halo franchise, but as today Bungie no longer part of Microsoft. Ask anyone who works there to search the global address book, they 2019re no longer in there. Microsoft was supposed to release the press release today but if they wait till the 10 6 the impact wont effect the quarterly results. However today is the actual official date and the day the NDAs expire, however you still didn 2019t hear this from me. Apparently MS just wants Bungie to make Halo for the rest of their natural days, and Bungie doesn 2019t like how MS is constantly trying to 201chandle 201d everything they do; the way they market their games, the way they interact with their fans (basically the fact that they do appreciate their fans), and how stingie they are with the profits (comparable to the rest of the industry). So as of today they are their own independent entity. They 2019ll probably make Halo 4 for Microsoft, however hey are also free to create new intellectual properties for whatever system they want. (Even though they prefer the xbox platform) What a way to say thank you. In one example that might illustrate the reason for tension between Microsoft and Bungie, screen shots surfaced on the Internet this week showing what appears to be an unreleased version of Halo developed for Nintendo 2019s popular DS handheld gaming system. Some in the gaming community have speculated that Microsoft was unwilling to release the game and risk giving ammunition to a rival 2019s gaming platform. With Bungie as a separate entity, it would have more power to decide how its future games are marketed and on what platforms, including those from Nintendo and Sony (SNE). Bungie was an independent studio until Microsoft bought it seven years ago for about $40 million. Before it was acquired by Microsoft, Bungie was known for creating games for several platforms; its Marathon game, a precursor to Halo, was popular on Apple 2019s Macintosh computers. For more details on the Bungie Microsoft split, see this Kotaku interview . REDMOND, Wash. 2014 Oct. 5, 2007 2014 Microsoft Corp. today announced a plan for Bungie Studios, the developers of the 201cHalo 00ae 201d franchise, to embark on a path to become an independent company. Microsoft will retain an equity interest in Bungie, at the same time continuing its long-standing publishing agreement between Microsoft Game Studios and Bungie for the Microsoft-owned 201cHalo 201d intellectual property as well as other future properties developed by Bungie. The critically acclaimed Xbox 360 00ae-exclusive 201cHalo 3 2033 achieved $300 million in global sales in its first week. Released on Tuesday, Sept. 25, 201cHalo 3 2033 is the fastest-selling video game ever and already one of the most successful entertainment properties in history. 201cOur collaboration with Bungie has resulted in 2018Halo 2019 becoming an enduring mainstream hit, 201d said Shane Kim, corporate vice president of Microsoft Game Studios. 201cWhile we are supporting Bungie 2019s desire to return to its independent roots, we will continue to invest in our 2018Halo 2019 entertainment property with Bungie and other partners, such as Peter Jackson, on a new interactive series set in the 2018Halo 2019 universe. We look forward to great success with Bungie as our long-term relationship continues to evolve through 2018Halo 2019-related titles and new IP created by Bungie. 201d 201cThis exciting evolution of our relationship with Microsoft will enable us to expand both creatively and organizationally in our mission to create world-class games, 201d said Harold Ryan, studio head for Bungie. 201cWe will continue to develop with our primary focus on Microsoft 00ae platforms; we greatly value our mutually prosperous relationship with our publisher, Microsoft Game Studios; and we look forward to continuing that affiliation through 2018Halo 2019 and beyond. 201d Bungie Studios will remain in its current location in Kirkland, Wash.

   "input": "SINOP, Turkey 2014 Turkish and American flags now fly over the strategic outpost on the Black Sea here that is expected to play an important role in monitoring Soviet compliance with any future treaty limiting strategic arms. A defense agreement between Turkey and the United States, signed in March, has placed this key intelligence base, as well as other American military facilities in Turkey, under joint operation. ''When this base was closed, there was a big gap in NATO's functions; NATO lost a lot,'' said the Turkish Army commander at the base, Col. Vedat Ozsecen. ''We still don't understand the United States arms embargo, but as time went by both sides understood the mistake.'' Colonel Ozsecen referred to the period between July 27,1975, and Oct. 9,1978, when the Turkish Army cut off all operations at Sinop and other American facilities in response to the United States arms embargo after Turkey's military intervention in Cyprus. 'Observation and Control' The colonel described Sinop's functions as ''observation and control of the opposite bloc'' and stressed that the observation was directed to technical and economic as well as military developments. In the office next to Colonel Ozsecen, the United States commander here, Col. Franklin Parker of the Army, spoke in broad terms about Sinop's mission, which he said was ''to conduct communications activities.'' He refused to answer questions about the nature of the activities or to give any details on the operations or the equipment. Sinop station is a 300-acre facility situated on a bleak 700-foot hill at the end of a peninsula, and the huge white radar domes and microwave antennas are clearly visible from the sea and air. Authoritative published reports provide greater detail about the operations than the Sinop commanders would give. Sinop's intelligence base monitors Soviet activities in the Black Sea area and Soviet missile tests, providing tactical and strategic intelligence on Soviet operations, according to a staff report prepared last spring for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Provides Early Warning Lieut. Cmdr. Edward Mark Ozehoski of the United States Navy's detachment at Sinop said the base was also valuable for its additional early-warning ability. Commander Ozehoski emphasized that the joint operations with the Turks, which began Nov. 3, would increase the usefulness of the operations. He pointed out that considerable time is wasted in training the American personnel, who generally come for one year, and that the Turkish personnel who remain for longer periods provide continuity. The Sinop installation is also called Diogenes Station, named after the philosopher who was born in ancient Sinope, as it was called then. Sinop today is a quiet fishing port and farm center with a population of just over 18,0, and few reminders of its illustrious past are visible. With its broad natural harbor, Sinop is believed to have been settled as early as 1200 B.C. According to historians, Sinope was an important port under the Hittites, Assyrians, Greeks, Romans and Byzantines. Under the Ottoman Empire, Sinop was an important naval base and the site of a major battle. On Nov. 30,1853, the Russian Navy attacked what was almost the entire Ottoman Navy anchored in Sinop harbor, destroying the fleet and much of the town. In later years, because of its isolation and poor roads, Sinop served mainly as a penal colony. There are about 450 American and 125 Turkish military personnel at the base. There are also 340 Turkish civilian employees. Self-Contained Installation Both Turkish and American sources say there have been no real security problems here. For one thing, Sinop is built on an isthmus and is easy to control with only one access road. Also, the hilltop installation is a self-contained unit, with its own dining and recreational facilities, dispensary, chapel, theater, library, post exchange and postal service. ''We have the best facilities in Turkey and really only one problem, separation from our families,'' Capt. John Napier said as he guided a visitor around the installation. The absence of dependents was the main complaint, but most Americans felt that the hardship was bearable since the tour was for only one year. There were some complaints about the isolation - a bus ride to Ankara takes 10 hours - about the weather - hail as big as golfballs and wind gusts up to 60 miles an hour - and above all about the ban on automobiles for military personnel. But most people showed a positive outlook, such as First Sgt. Anthony Gagliardi from Brooklyn, who has spent 26 years in the Army and has a wife and child in Oceanport, N.J. ''We have everything here and more time to enjoy people and get to know each other,'' he said at the base club. ''Back in the States when you finish work, you go home, but here we're more closely knit -on duty and off.''  ",

   "input": "Investors avoided another roller coaster day on Wall Street Friday. What they got instead was a steady, moderate decline that left the market with its worst weekly performance since May 2012. Technology shares were especially hard hit. Semiconductor makers slumped after Microchip Technology cut its sales forecast for the quarter and warned investors to expect bad news from others in the sector. That sent shares lower for Avago Technologies, Intel and Texas Instruments, among others. Microchip Technology declined the most, shedding $5.59, or 12.3 percent, to $39.96. The decline capped a week of turbulence in the market brought on by renewed fears that economic growth in Europe could be slowing. The Dow Jones industrial average recorded its biggest gain of the year on Wednesday. The next day, it plunged 334 points, its steepest decline this year. 2018 2018A lot of investors are trying to come to grips with the pickup in volatility we've suddenly seen during this week, 2019 2019 said David Kelly, chief global strategist for JPMorgan Funds. The major stock indexes were down in premarket trading Friday. The slide in semiconductor stocks dragged down the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index, keeping it in the red all day. The other indexes flirted with small gains throughout the day, but the course didn 2019t hold. They ended lower for the fourth time in five days. All told, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 115.15, or 0.7 percent, to 16,544.10. The Standard & Poor 2019s 500 index shed 22.08, or 1.2 percent, to 1,906.13. The Nasdaq slid 102.10 points, or 2.3 percent, to 4,276.24. All three indexes ended lower for the week. For the S&P 500, this was the worst weekly decline since May 18,2012, when it fell 4.3 percent. Negative economic news and a slide in oil prices contributed to the uneasiness on Wall Street this week, market watchers said. Germany, which has been the economic powerhouse for Europe, reported on Thursday its biggest monthly drop in exports in five years. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund downgraded its outlook for global economic growth. In addition, some traders are interpreting the decline in oil prices as further indication that growth is slowing. 2018 2018You put those three factors together and it has investors nervous at the health of the world economy, 2019 2019 said Jeff Kravetz, regional investment director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. The volatility in the market this week also came at a time of relatively light corporate news in the U.S. That changes next week, when major companies begin to report their latest quarterly results. 2018 2018Third-quarter earnings season should be pretty reassuring, and I wouldn 2019t be surprised to see money go back into various stocks as companies surprise to the upside, which is what I expect them to do, 2019 2019 said Kelly. Investors did not appear to be overly optimistic on Friday. Eight of the 10 sectors in the S&P 500 fell, led by technology stocks. Utilities and consumer staples bucked the trend. Shares in electric car maker Tesla slumped after investors looked over the company 2019s late-Thursday announcement of a new all-wheel drive car. The stock lost $20.10, or 7.8 percent, to $236.91.

The World Health Organization is now describing the outbreak as the most severe , acute health emergency seen in modern times. 201d We rely on experts for so many things in life, from doctors capably diagnosing and treating illness to defence analysts assessing terrorist risk to accountants that audit corporate finances to assure investors that all is above board. Unfortunately, experts are often wrong. Take auditors, whose entire purpose 2014 mandated by law 2013 is to carefully evaluate the way a company accounts for its activities. Without an auditing function, how could investors feel confident that the enterprise in which they are placing their trust, and their money, is legitimate? Alas, auditors are remarkably fallible and for very human reasons. Is it a coincidence that the auditing team from Arthur Andersen that worked on the Enron account consisted of numerous former employees of Enron? And that these same accountants continued to sign off on increasingly questionable accounting practices quarter after quarter? I make no aspersions as to whether the accountants behaved in an illegal, or even unethical manner. My point is that the familiarity of overseers with the client could have served to somehow colour their thinking in a way that disrupted their ordinary diligence and competence. Surely something quite analogous occurred among rating agencies in the run up to the financial crisis of 2008. These agencies 2014 Standard and Poor 2019s, Moody 2019s, Fitch 2014 consistently rated bundles of subprime mortgages sold by financial institutions with their highest rating of safety. And it is this assurance that enabled a market to form to trade in subprime. These two stories have one more thing in common 2013 the people whose job it was to provide oversight were paid by the companies they had jurisdiction over. Again, it 2019s not that the experts at Enron or S&P set out to be negligent, it 2019s just that they did. Self-interest, which is at the heart of the matter, often operates at a subconscious level. The people I 2019m writing about may well be enraged to be reading this, because they truly believe they didn 2019t behave in an unethical manner. And that may be so. What experts 2013 indeed, all of us 2013 don 2019t often appreciate is how easy it is to think we 2019re absolutely doing the right thing when in fact we 2019re not. When they get it wrong Experts can be wrong for many other reasons. What of the vaunted Secret Service in the US, the legendary government agency responsible for protecting politicians? How could a potential assailant gain access to the White House, running from room to room before being apprehended? While there will be investigations, I 2019m willing to bet the problem has more to do with culture than competence. Most experts come wrapped up in an organisation, complete with bureaucratic infighting, misaligned incentives and poor leadership. It 2019s tough to be an effective expert when the detritus of organisational life surrounds you. So experts have flaws, some self-inflicted and some driven by context. But let 2019s be careful not to over react. What would life be if there were no experts? For one thing, even worse than the state of affairs we 2019re in now. Expertise comes from careful investigation, and sometimes experience, designed to yield insights of value to some part of society. If there were no experts, for example, many people would have no reason to be concerned about climate change. The fact that some people insist in 2014 that carbon dioxide emissions are not related to temperatures on Earth could be a classic example of what happens when thinking is uninformed by expert knowledge. In a world without experts, decisions are based on ideology, hardly the basis for careful analysis. All of which is to say that when it comes to the Ebola threat, I am putting my trust in the modern health-care establishment, not because I think they are definitely correct, but because that 2019s all we 2019ve got.

   "input": "AFINAL decision on whether to discontinue through train service between Bay Head and New York City has been delayed by NJ Transit for at least four months because of unexpected problems in completing electrification of the line between South Amboy and Matawan. It was expected that the electrification project would have been completed by the end of the year, but the new date is now next April because of delays in the delivery of critical signal equipment. The North Jersey Coast Line, as it is known, serves 10,000 commuters. NJ Transit has proposed that all of its Diesel-operated trains, which orginate in Bay Head, terminate their northbound runs in Newark, where New York-bound passengers would be required to change to electric trains. As could be expected, the propsal has sparked loud complaints from many of the organized groups of commuters who use the line. As David M. Pindar of Avon, head of Shore Commuters for On-Time Service (SCOTS), one of the most vocal of the organizations, put it: ''It's one of the dumbest things anyone has ever come up with. No private business would do things this way. They're pouring in capital funds and then cutting service and driving away riders.'' The line is currently electrified as far south as South Amboy. Between that point and Bay Head, Diesel engines are used to haul the conventional commuter cars. When New York-bound trains reach South Amboy on the northbound run, the Diesels are replaced by electric locomotives. Trains that terminate in Newark, or begin their southbound runs there, are drawn by Diesels all the way. (Diesels are prohibited from using the Hudson River tunnels into and of Pennsylvania Station in New York because of pollution control regulations.) An exception are the all-electric, multiple-unit trains - the socalled MU's - that operate between South Amboy and New York, making local stops along the way. Such trains are projected to serve Matawan when the electrification is completed. NJ Transit officials hope to realize substantial savings by eliminating the costly engine change in South Amboy and, instead, having the approximately 2,700 New York-bound commuters transfer to regular Conrail trains in Newark. Mr. Pindar said the figure that NJ Transit used when the plan was first mentioned a year ago was $6 million, but officials at the agency do not concur. ''Our report is not yet complete,'' said Martin E. Robins, deputy executive director of NJ Transit. He said he was studying the issue carefully before making any decision, but stressed that NJ Transit had never committed itself to going through with the plan. Before NJ Transit's analysis is complete, it must receive information from Amtrak concerning the cost of maintaining the old GG-1 electric locomotives at Amtrak's Wilmington, Del., repair yards. Mr. Pindar and other commuters claim that any savings projected by NJ Transit will not be realized. In a special report prepared by SCOTS, the group says that each of the four New York-bound trains arriving in Newark within a 29-minute span during the morning rush hour contains upward of 900 riders. ''It is difficult to imagine the degree of chaos and public inconvenience that throwing these numbers of people into the crowd at the Newark station will cause,'' the SCOTS report asserted. According to Mr. Pindar, a New York-bound commuter detraining in Newark not only would have to go to another platform, but also contend with hundreds of commuters from the Raritan Valley line also heading for New York and construction work now going on in the station's main concourse. Such added inconveniences, Mr. Pindar said, will drive away commuters. Since 1976, the state has poured nearly $175 million into improving the coast line. More than $85 million of that amount was spent on extending electrified service from South Amboy to Matawan. Long-range plans call for electrification to be extended to Long Branch by 1985. In addition to the electrification project, NJ Transit is purchasing new locomotives, cars and signal equipment for the line, as well as spending $6.2 million for repairs to the Raritan River drawbridge. In making its final decision on the plan, NJ Transit is considering how much of an inconvenience changing trains in Newark will actually impose on commuters. ''No transfers are popular, '' Mr. Robins said. ''We've got to look at how many people are really affected and whether they really are going to leave the service if asked to switch trains.'' There has been some concern over the continued use of the old GG-1 locomotives. The Federal Environmental Protection Agency had ordered all the engines pulled out of service by Jan. 1 because their electric transformers are cooled by a substance containing a chemical suspected of being a cancer-causing agent. NJ Transit has asked for a waiver to permit the GG-1s to contine in operation. Anthony DePalma  ",

I have witnessed many shop,office and factory visits before, with bosses being received in a variety of ways. In some cases, they were welcome but often they were met with indifference or, of course, outright hostility. But the reaction at the Covent Garden store was off the charts: the staff gasped, and then burst into spontaneous, loud applause as soon as they spotted Cook, who walked in behind them. It may have also helped that Cook called the London store one of his favorites in the entire world.  ",

   "input": "Updated FEB 27, 2015 3:18p ET PHOENIX -- When the Phoenix Suns trade deadline drew one question about why the team would upset and then trade Goran Dragic, referred to in a press conference as the team's best player, general manager Ryan McDonough met it with this thought: Eric Bledsoe and Markieff Morris are still in Phoenix Suns uniforms. Save the argument about whether that is true or if it was a pointed statement. McDonough has a point. Phoenix needs Bledsoe and Morris to perform like its best players if it has any chance to prolong its life in the Western Conference playoff hunt. The Suns (31-28) are 1.5 games behind eighth-seeded Oklahoma City heading into a Saturday night home game against San Antonio , which proceeds a four-game road trip to Miami, Orlando, Brooklyn and Cleveland. In Thursday night's 117-113 overtime win against Oklahoma City, Bledsoe diced the Thunder for a near-triple-double and helped limit Russell Westbrook's efficiency, making the Suns look smart for offering him that five-year, $70 million deal in the offseason. But it was Morris who put a few bad games behind him to score 29 points and grab 11 rebounds against the well-respected Serge Ibaka. I was due for it , Morris said. The thing about me is I'm not going to stop. I'm going to keep shooting; my confidence is going to be high. No matter how many games I've played badly , no matter how many I've missed, the team, we're trying to make a great playoff push right now. They need that. They need me to be aggressive, they need everybody to be aggressive. Morris shot 12 of 26 from the floor , not the most efficient evening, but he also converted a key three-point play that gave the Suns a three-point lead with 20 seconds left. It was several options on that play and it just happened to be one of the later ones that came up , Suns coach Jeff Hornacek said. P.J. (Tucker) made a nice read , executed the play well. By the end of the night , Morris pulled himself out of a funk. He was 3 for 15 Saturday in a loss to Chicago, scored just seven points on 3-for-9 shooting against Boston and had a five-point, 1-for-5 outing Wednesday at Denver. Then Thursday came along, and in what could be viewed as a backbreaking game had the Suns lost, the two players McDonough pointed to as leaders in the most recent post-Dragic era came through. And again, consider who Morris did this against. Ibaka's a great player , a great defender, first and formost, the ever-confident Morris said , but ... But Ibaka had few answers. He scored 13 points , blocked three shots and grabbed nine rebounds. Meanwhile, Morris stayed away from longer two-point jumpers, acting patient in the post and using his quickness and a few decisive moves to get off good looks. Morris also put together another decent rebounding outing, a key point in the last two Phoenix victories. The Suns outrebounded Oklahoma City and even outgained the Thunder in second-chance points, 16-11. As much as Ibaka's game has evolved to become more perimeter-oriented, Morris has grown most by operating more out of the post, then picking his spots to stretch the floor by taking 3s. Compare Ibaka's four-year, $48 million contract that goes two seasons beyond this one next to Markieff and twin Marcus' combined $52 million for four years. The Suns can't complain, they just need more consistency. In the aftermath of a busy trade deadline, Morris stands as a needed producer more than ever. He'll also look to play leader. We had to come together more , Morris said. It was a tough couple of weeks for us. We're just going to push as much as possible , trying to get in these playoffs. We're not going to give up. The way we look at it, this team, it's us against the world. The Suns need to talk. That's been of greater defensive concern than playing together with new pieces on the court. Before Jeff Hornacek's team took on the Thunder , the head coach complimented newcomer Brandon Knight and his ability to communicate on defense. Hornacek wishes the rest of Phoenix's roster would take notice. When we had our meeting about defense , we said, 'hey, we have to talk more, we have to communicate, ' Hornacek said. We try to tell the guys , hey, say anything, say something. Say there's a good-lookin' chick in the first row, whatever it is. Just say something, please. Hopefully they pick that up. It's usually the same thing: If you can get one or two guys doing it, then maybe that third guy goes, 'Oh, OK, I can get out of my comfort zone a little bit.' Follow Kevin Zimmerman on Twitter  ",

Defence lawyers for the shoe designer,53, whose name cannot be reported under privacy guidelines for German media, had called for an acquittal, saying the plane's steep dive from 1500 metres was the trainee's attempt to ward off a sexual advance from the teacher, now 75, and was not intended to cause a crash. Prosecutors told the court in Frankfurt an der Oder on the Polish border that the incident in 2013 east of Berlin was suicidal. The teacher wrested back control of the plane just before impact, and he landed it safely. The accused was sentenced to nine years in February 2014 but the verdict was overturned on appeal and sent back for retrial. Appeal judges said the first trial did not confirm an intention to kill lasting throughout the plunge, a factor required for the defendant to be found guilty of attempted murder.

With the news that Yahoo acquired blogging platform Tumblr for $1.1 billion this week, we present a 1996 feature on how search companies were struggling t0 make money after big IPOs. Let 2019s look back on a time before 201cGoogle 201d was a ubiquitous verb and a major player in search. Ninety million pages. That 2019s almost as much text as is stored in the Library of Congress. It 2019s enough paper to go from L.A. to Bangkok and back. It 2019s the contents of the World Wide Web 2013or at least it was a second ago. According to Forrester Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts, almost 170,000 pages are added to the Web daily. PC owners worldwide are playing digital show-and-tell, publishing text, pictures, and audio about their companies, themselves, and the secret lives of their dogs. Search companies promise to be your digital Sherpas, guiding you through this glut of data. The leaders 2013Yahoo, Infoseek, Lycos, and Excite 2013basically index and catalogue the Internet using a combination of technology and human know-how. Web travelers visit these companies 2019 sites to request the location of data on the Net. Different sites return different kinds of information 2013a Yahoo search on 201cIrish whiskey 201d gives you a broad index of whiskey Web locales, as well as four links to specific sites; Lycos brings back 99 links. Because of the Web 2019s chaos, search sites have become among the most popular stopping points on the Net 2013Yahoo alone gets up to two million visitors a day. To turn that cachet into cash, the search outfits charge hefty fees for advertising banners that span the tops of their Web pages. Their clientele reaches well beyond Silicon Valley 2013companies like Nissan, Mastercard, and Sharper Image have helped the four search companies rank among the top ad sites on the Web. That 2019s why search companies became investors 2019 digital darlings. Yahoo, Infoseek, Lycos, and Excite raised $170 million by going public this year. But like a lava flow off Mount St. Helens, the explosive growth of the Internet constantly redefines the landscape of cyberspace; it demands that companies adapt their strategies almost daily or be buried in ashes. In the short time since the search companies went public, their business plans have become obsolete. Search has become a commodity 2013there are now more than 200 ways to find and retrieve information in cyberspace. Worse, Internet advertising doesn 2019t seem to work. The search companies are generating paltry revenues and losing money. In their most recent quarters, the four had combined revenues of $16.2 million 2013and a combined loss of $16.4 million. Wall Street has reacted as you might expect. Excite went public on April 4, and at the end of the day its shares sold for $20; as FORTUNE went to press, they were trading at $6.50, a drop in value of 68%. Lycos 2019s shares are down 47% since its IPO; Yahoo 2019s are off 44%; and Infoseek 2019s, down 31%. What went wrong? Advertisers pay Website publishers between $10 and $100 for every 1,000 201cimpressions, 201d jargon for the number of times a Web page is loaded. But showing results in cyberspace is more difficult than promised by promoters of Net advertising, who hyped the Net as the ultimate medium for one-to-one marketing, or digital direct mail. Jeff Bezos, CEO of the virtual bookstore Amazon.com, advertises on all four search sites 2013but he believes his print ads, in publications like the Wall Street Journal, are what bring in the business. 201cIf you see the ad in print several times and then see the banner on a Website, 201d he says, 201cyou might decide to buy something. But when the advertising 2019s just Web-based, it 2019s not crystal clear to the viewer that this is a real business. There are no products in the window, no other customers, no proof you are giving your credit card number to a real company. 201d That helps explain why advertisers have balked at committing dollars to Internet campaigns. Of the estimated $174 billion that will be spent this year on advertising in the U.S., just $312 million will go to Net ads, according to Jupiter Communications in New York City. The fact is, Yahoo, Infoseek, Lycos, and Excite are just four among hundreds of Websites that carry advertising. And skeptics now question why anyone ever thought search sites would be effective locations for ads. Sure, they draw tons of traffic. But the very charter of a search site is to get visitors in and out as quickly as possible. To expect young squires to linger over a Lexus ad while on a vision quest to discover Pamela Anderson Lee 2019s most recent endowments seems, well, a bit optimistic. Furthermore, in the nerdy rough-and-tumble of cyberspace, several software companies, including Quarterdeck and Symantec, seem to be doing their best to eradicate the search companies 2019 chances of making money on ads. They 2019ve introduced ad-zapping software that lets users comb several search sites simultaneously without ever having to encounter an ad, or even a search company 2019s logo. No wonder the search companies have resorted to strategies far different from the ones they started with. They 2019re recasting themselves as digital destinations, loading up their sites with content and software that will tempt visitors to linger 2013and read the ads. Some are mutating even further, diversifying feverishly in an effort to adapt to the Net 2019s ever-changing environment. Still, the consensus among analysts is that only a couple will survive. 201cA shakeout is in the offing, 201d predicts Jupiter 2019s Patrick Keane. Steve O 2019Leary, managing director of Broadview Associates in Fort Lee, New Jersey, agrees: 201cI think we are likely to see merger and acquisition activity among these companies. 201d The game among analysts is to pick the survivors, and maybe even a winner. Though the company 2019s stock price scarcely reflects it, many now view Yahoo as the brand to beat. Just two years ago, Yahoo was little more than the pet project of two Stanford University Ph.D. candidates who lived in a trailer. In 1994, co-founders Jerry Yang and David Filo were supposed to be doing research on the computer-aided design of semiconductor circuits. Instead, they whiled away the schooldays creating a directory that catalogued Websites according to a filing system they made up (Dewey would spontaneously combust if he saw it). They published their directory free on the Web, calling their site Jerry and David 2019s Guide to the World Wide Web. Net-heads flocked to the site, and Filo and Yang gave up their doctoral studies to concentrate on expanding the guide, which they renamed Yahoo (for Yet Another Hierarchic Officious Oracle). In April 1995, they raised $1 million in venture funding from Sequoia Capital, and moved out of the trailer and into a real office in Mountain View, California. One year 2013and one wildly successful IPO later 2013the two were worth $132 million each. Today, Yahoo employs more than 120 people. Topping the list is President and CEO Tim Koogle,45, a veteran of Motorola. Koogle, one of the few graybeards in the office, runs the business, freeing Yang,28, to glad-hand the press and investors. Filo,32, as chief Yahoo of technology, remains shackled to the company 2019s servers 2013he insists he has no life outside Yahoo. At the start, the strategy was simple: Push the brand. Luck helped 2013Netscape 2019s Marc Andreessen was so impressed by the Yahoo directory that, back in January 1995, he made Yahoo the default directory for Netscape 2019s Navigator browser 2013users who clicked on the Net Search button at the top of their browser screen were automatically routed to Yahoo. The arrangement ended last December 2013Netscape now charges five search companies, including Yahoo, $5 million a year each to rent space behind the Net Search button 2013but it helped make Yahoo famous on the Web. The service now daily receives up to two million visitors, who access the site 14 million times. According to Jupiter, more than 75% of those visits come from individuals who have bookmarked or otherwise chosen Yahoo as their search site. Still, Yang and Filo know that owning a brand name that wins repeat search visitors isn 2019t enough. 201cThe fundamental bet we are making is that we are a media company, not a tools company, 201d says Yang. 201cIf we are a tools company, we are not going to survive. Microsoft will just take over our space. If we are a publication, like a FORTUNE or a Time, and we create brand loyalty, then we have a sustainable business. 201d Yang 2019s push to turn Yahoo into a brand that stands for more than searching will be helped by the company 2019s alliance with Softbank, a Japanese media conglomerate. Last April, Softbank added to its burgeoning Internet portfolio by paying $106 million for a 37% stake in Yahoo. Yang has launched two brand extensions that stem directly from the partnership. Ziff-Davis, a trade-press publishing company Softbank owns, is putting out a print magazine called Yahoo Internet Life and creating a PC information center on the Web called Yahoo Computing. Yahoo is also getting into television, as a provider of technology information for local newscasts. But most of its budding media ventures are online. Last March, Yang launched Yahooligans, an online directory for children. In partnership with print outfits like Fodor 2019s and the Village Voice, Yahoo is creating travel guides for U.S. cities. Before traveling from New York to San Francisco, say, you 2019ll log on to Yahoo 2019s San Francisco Website to find out what 2019s happening in town and what people are saying about the hottest restaurants. The goal is to transform Yahoo 2019s Website into what Web-heads call 201ca destination 201d 2013a site where a visitor will stay to browse a number of pages, rather than just one. Keeping customers longer helps sell ads, and so does going local 2013Yahoo is betting that restaurants and shops will want to advertise on its city-based sites. The company is also designing custom sites in Japan, Germany, and Britain. So far, the ambitious effort has neither produced profits nor revitalized the share price. Nor has it fundamentally altered the perception of Yahoo. 201cMost of our users today approach Yahoo and type in a keyword and go from there, 201d says Yang. 201cThey do not stop at our other sites. 201d Still, compared with the other search sites, Yahoo is sitting pretty: The company has respected senior managers, a cohesive branding strategy that it has been pushing for months, and perhaps most significant, over $100 million in the bank. Says Jupiter 2019s Patrick Keane: 201cYahoo is leaps and bounds ahead. It 2019s almost ludicrous to mention them in the same breath as the others. 201d The only competitive race is for second place. It is a dogfight among Infoseek, Lycos, and Excite. Ironically, in their race to differentiate themselves, the three are becoming more and more alike. Like Yahoo, each has a media strategy. In addition to search capability, each company now includes on its site ordinary content like news, weather forecasts, sports scores, and stock quotes. Each offers a personalized news service, so that when you visit, you automatically get information related to subjects you care about. Each wants to stake out a market niche. Infoseek 2019s CEO and president Robin Johnson is trying to pull away from the pack by positioning Infoseek as the business person 2019s oracle. 201cIf you 2019re in business and you 2019re busy, this is the search site for you, 201d he says, adding that the company has developed software to help users refine their searches so they find what they want more often. To get the message across, Johnson and his team have spent more than $5 million on a print and radio advertising campaign. It 2019s too early to determine if the ads are hitting their mark, but analysts applaud Johnson 2019s focus on the business niche. As a brand, Lycos trails the pack. The name doesn 2019t help 2013it sounds like that of a pharmaceuticals company. But the Marlboro, Massachusetts, firm is undergoing an identity-lift. The company redesigned its site 2013it now looks a lot like America Online 2013and hired a new vice president of marketing with a track record in consumer branding strategies to help Lycos boost its visibility among netizens. In addition, Lycos has inked deals with companies like AT&T, Compuserve, Prodigy, Bertelsmann, and Sprint to license its Web index. According to Lycos president Bob Davis, these deals not only bring in additional revenue 2013$4.5 million 2013they also turn Lycos into a gateway to the Internet. Of all the companies, Excite seems to be in the most precarious position. The company is burning through cash, having spent $30 million this year on high-profile acquisitions, partnerships, and advertising. This summer Excite acquired McKinley, creator of Magellan, a highly detailed Web catalogue, for $5 million in stock and $10 million in assumed debt. Excite then ponied up an additional $10 million to Netscape to keep both Magellan and Excite active behind the Net Search button.

For Cosmic Thing, the work that made the Mexican artist's name when it dazzled visitors to the 2003 Venice Biennale, he simply dismantled a VW Beetle 2013 from the tongue-like curve of its bonnet to the liquorice Os of its wheels. Hanging from the ceiling, as if the entire thing had spontaneously leapt apart into a nuts-and-bolts constellation, the people's car became a thing of wonder. Items you find around the house and on the street 2013 piles of bricks , tortillas, oil drums, rotting fruit 2013 are among his favourite materials. His work Classified Cob, where each shrivelled kernel on a cob of sweetcorn has been numbered, makes an old vegetable seem quite marvellous. 120 Days, created with the aid of Venetian glassblowers, transforms Coke bottles into curvaceous stems that look like sex toys worthy of the Marquis de Sade, whose 120 Days of Sodom is referenced in the title. Born in 1967, Ortega is a frontrunner of the generation that's emerged in the wake of Mexican artists like his former teacher, Gabriel Orozco, or Francis Alys. As with his forebears, he makes playful use of everyday finds, while opening a window on to political and economic subtexts. In Mexico 2013 where the German VW Beetle has been made, marketed and a major hit 2013 the car is a charged icon of western cultural imposition. Secret histories of materials course through Ortega's current London show, Traces of Gravity, where salt is the connecting thread. A thin line of it runs like a coke hit across Congo River, a landscape of black tyres that calls to mind the infamous rubber trade that quickened the pace of colonial atrocities in the Congo, and which inspired Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness. Elsewhere, it pours like an hourglass from a huge submarine made out of industrial food sacks, suspended from the ceiling in a darkened space. The appearance of salt in photography is more gentle: invoked by the shadow of a prone bicycle on a bed of salt, where the bike's spinning wheel creates a lo-fi moving image that looks back to the magic lantern shows that predated cinema. As always, Ortega's raw materials suggest much more than the sum of their parts. Why we like him: For his film series 9 Types of Terrain, where children's games align with war games. Rows of standing bricks fall like dominoes, arranged in formations that echo the nine types of battlefield Sun Tzu outlined in The Art of War. The bricks might be people, homes, or civilisations, falling and springing back to life as the films begin again and again. Power of the pen: Ortega started out as a political cartoonist. Where can I see him? At White Cube to 8 September.  ",

The food chain has worked for more than two years to eliminate products that contain genetically modified organisms, more commonly known as GMOs. GMO crops, which are common among corn and soybeans, contain altered DNA that make the plants more resistant to pests and other environmental stresses. More than 90% of corn and soy grown in the U.S. comes from genetically modified seeds. Many scientific groups and other proponents say these crops are safe, while critics say they cause a host of environmental ills and could even cause harm to human health. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved a number of genetically modified crops. Chipotle, which has 1,831 restaurants globally, has labeled which of its menu items contain GMO ingredients since as early as 2013.

   "input": "UNION AT THE Kean for Governor headquarters here recently, staff members were still introducing themselves to each other, and the only hints of the frenetic activity to come were dozens of shiny black telephones and the electrical outlets for typewriters that lined the orange carpet. One filing cabinet stood alone in the corner of the main room of the two-story office building, and there were no placards, posters or other material to remind a visitor that Thomas H. Kean is the Republican candidate for Governor. However, Mr. Kean's campaign advisors began to plan for his race against James J. Florio immediately after Mr. Kean's victory over seven opponents in the June primary. ''We've taken some time to sit back since the primary, to do our homework and to get properly organized for the coming election,'' said Rodger Bodman, Mr. Kean's campaign director, who will supervise an office staff of 30 paid employees and perhaps twice as many volunteers. ''We have people out polling right now to try and identify vulnerable spots, and our financial program has already become quite active.'' Perhaps the most important policy decision facing the staff in the next several weeks is whether to accept public financing from the state. Although Mr. Kean is not philosophically opposed to the concept, his finance coordinator, Al Fasola, believes that accepting the strictures that accompany public financing, such as adherence to the state-imposed spending limitations, might harm the campaign and the state Republican organization. ''The G.O.P. State Committee could raise between $2 million and $3 million over the next four months,'' Mr. Fasola said, ''and we have to keep in mind that we are still a minority party in the state. We have to spend more to elect a Republican Governor and Legislature.'' Mr. Fasola intends to help elect both. He will act as coordinator for the Republican State Committee's fund-raising efforts, as well as for those of the Kean campaign. In the next four months, he hopes to raise an average of $100,000 a week for Mr. Kean and an additional $750,000 a month for the state committee. If a decision is made not to accept public financing, the fundraising objectives will be doubled, Mr. Fasola said. ''We're not into gimmicks,'' he asserted. ''People want to know where their money is going. We believe in using fewer and fewer tools better and better. We will rely on mail, phones, personal appearances and fund-raising events.'' Both Mr. Fasola and Carl Golden, Mr. Kean's press secretary, believe that the campaign must stress grass-roots organizing, particularly because New Jersey has no statewide television station. ''We will get Tom out and about,'' Mr. Golden said. ''He will go wherever he can, as often as he can. ''What we want to emphasize throughout is that the campaign is placing the candidate personally before the voters. Tom Kean is his own best advertisement.'' There is probably at least one advertisement that Kean campaign officials would agree is as important as the presence of the candidate. ''President Reagan is a tremendous asset,'' Mr. Bodman said, ''and it is incredibly important that he come here.'' Mr. Bodman added that both the President and Vice President Bush had met with Mr. Kean in Washington last month, and that both agreed to do ''all they could do'' to help elect Mr. Kean. Because there is only one other gubernatorial race this year, in Virginia, there will be a natural tendency for political observers to view this election as a referendum on President Reagan's performance so far. But this does not disturb anyone at Kean headquarters. ''I think we ought to play the referendum thing down,'' Mr. Golden said. ''After all, seven and a half million people are going to be faced with a big choice for Governor, not just a yes or no on the President. I believe that people want to make a statement about eight years of Democratic leadership in New Jersey.'' The Republican campaign officials agree that there is one particular achievement of the Byrne administration that they would like to match. ''Byrne is the only New Jersey Governor I can remember to have served eight years with control by his party of both houses of the Legislature,'' Mr. Bodman said. ''We think we are within striking distance of that mark.'' The Republicans have not won a statewide election since Clifford P. Case was elected to the United States Senate in 1973. Mr. Golden says that he will try to counter those reversals by bringing in as many nationally prominent Republicans as possible to speak for Mr. Kean and to accompany him on trips around the state. Mr. Fasola has planned six major fund-raising events, and within the next few weeks direct-mail solicitations, which Mr. Golden calls the ''best and most effective campaign tools going,'' will pick up. ''The structure of the campaign is beginning to fall into place nicely,'' Mr. Golden declared. ''People don't want to hear about elections in July or August, and things don't appear hectic until after Labor Day. But for us, they never really slowed down.''

   "input": "From the Halls of Chase Manhattan To the desks of Merrill Lynch We fight the corporate battles. For ex-Marines, it is a cinch. Or so they say. Beginning with the White House, a sizable contingent of former Marines can currently be found in top management jobs. Is the corps a training ground for business management? President Reagan's selection of Donald T. Regan, former chairman and chief executive officer of Merrill Lynch & Company, as Secretary of the Treasury, seems a big vote for this proposition. Mr. Regan, who went from Marine private to lieutenant colonel in World War II, had built Merrill Lynch into Wall Street's dominant financial services group before going to Washington. ''Parris Island has the toughest indoctrination training anywhere, at least it used to,'' said Max M. Ulrich, president and chief executive of Ward Howell Associates, an executive recruiting firm. ''Guys who come out of this have a strong perception of self, and this carries over into the corporate world.'' Mr. Ulrich, who is a graduate of West Point, adds: ''Whether they're good as chief executives depends on the character of the company. In m any cases, an ex-Marine would not prove to be the best choice. But t hey can be good where strong leadership is needed. Take Donald Regan. You just look at Regan and say, 'Now that's a strong man.' '' While some former business colleagues say Mr. Regan ran the company as though it were the corps, others credit his success to an ability to select the right people for a job -something the Marines also stress. Besides Secretary Regan, some other former Marines prominent in the Administration include James A. Baker 3d, the White House Chief of Staff, and Terrel H. Bell, the Secretary of Education. Former Marines can be found as chairmen, presidents and chief executive officers of companies from American Telephone and Telegraph to Occidental Petroleum and on through the Singer Company, Chase Manhattan, Mor gan Guaranty, Time Inc., Riegel Textile and Federal Express, among others. John Elliott, who is chairman of Ogilvy & Mather International, one of the world's largest advertising agencies, recalls that ''joining the Marines was the turning point of my life.'' A Harvard graduate, he served with the Marines in World War II with the final rank of major. (Having been in the other services might have some virtues too. Mr. Elliott's brother Osborn, a Navy man, was editor of Newsweek magazine for years and is now dean of the journalism school at Columbia.) ''I had been a strictly undistinguished high school and college student,'' John Elliott recounts, ''but on July 20,1942, when I and other recruits arrived for training at Quantico, Va., I remember a very tall Marine lieutenant who told us, 'By the time this is over, of the 450 of you here, one-third will be out.' ''I decided I was not going to be one of them and for the first time ever, I did my best.'' Mr. Elliott said he stresses some Marine principles at Ogilvy & Mather. ''We are more selective in hiring people and we have a very intensive training program for our people from the ground up,'' he said. ''We get rid of those who can't cut the mustard and we do the job so that it is the best.'' George A. Roeder Jr., vice chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank, who entered the corps after college in 1942 and served to the end of World War II, said learning how to plan was another lesson of the Marine experience. Robert E. Coleman, chairman and chief executive officer of the Riegel Textile Company, served in the Pacific and north China through 1943-1946. He marvels that in World War II, the Marines ''performed miracles by taking ordinary people and making Marines out of them.'' One executive well qualified to attest to the value of Marine training in business is Alexander B. Trowbridge, now president of the National Association of Manufacturers. Mr. Trowbridge, who is a former Secretary of Commerce, has also been a vice chairman of the Allied Chemical Corporation, now the Allied Corporation, and president of the American Management Association. He served in Korea in 1951 as a captain and finished as a major. Former Marines, it appears, welcome the company of other former Marines in the executive suite. At The New York Times Company, the chairman, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, and the president, Walter Mattson, are former Marines. Mr. Trowbridge was vice chairman at Allied when John T. Connor, a fellow Marine who is now retired, was chairman. And several former Marines have found a home at Time Inc. J. Richard Monro, the company's new president and chief executive, was in the corps for three years and won three Purple Hearts. Three of the company's top line officers - Edward P. Lenahan, publisher of Fortune, John A. Meyers, publisher of Time and Richard J. Durrell, publisher of People - were also Marines. Mr. Monroe, however, sees the Marine experience simply as good training. 'What you learn in the corps helps in business in teamwork and relations with others,'' he says. ''You learn the importance of teamwork in combat, so that you never leave someone out there whether he is alive or dead.'' He derides the notion of the Marines as a sharp-saluting, orderbarking outfit. ''At Time Inc.,'' he says, '' we give a good deal of autonomy to people and don't tell them what to do. I haven't ever given an order to anyone here.'' Illustrations: Photo of John Elliott Photo of John Elliott as a young man  ",

   "input": "WASHINGTON, Aug. 4 2014 Time Inc. has announced the death of The Washington Star, but for over 100 years it was called by the most beautiful name in American journalism - The Evening Star - and everybody knows you cannot kill an evening star. It will be there winking over the capital until somebody brings it back to earth. All the obit writers have agreed that after the official burial on Friday, Washington will be left with only one daily newspaper, but this is obviously ridiculous, and nobody knows this better than the Meyers and the Grahams, who preside over The Washington Post. They are a tough and resourceful breed, and they have long memories. They remember when The Evening Star dominated this city, as The Post does today; and how, by the quirks of fate, the persistence and imagination of Eugene Meyer and Phil Graham (with a little help from Kent Cooper of the Associated Press and Colonel McCormick of The Chicago Tribune), they turned things around. The guess here is that the wheel will turn again, not right away, but sooner or later. For Washington has a fatal attraction for people with money and causes. It is the most powerful platform in the world. Nobody will buy the machinery and the debts of The Star, but somebody will undoubtedly buy the name and the dream. Time Inc., which built an empire by rewriting the established newspapers, made a valiant effort here. It inherited the best afternoon newspaper in the country, improved it, and failed. But it doesn't follow that Washington is going to be a one-newspaper town. What Time Inc. proved in Washington is what other enterprising publishers in Philadelphia, Chicago, Los Angeles, Boston, and Cleveland had feared - London and Paris learned the lesson long before - that despite its money and its genius there may be enough readers and advertisers left in all the great cities of the world to sustain one traditional newspaper, with its multiple sections on national, foreign, and local news; its style sections, food sections, travel sections, and sports sections - but not room in the urban ark for two such monsters a day. The cost of labor, newsprint, modern color presses and distribution out of the central cities into the suburbs, where most people now live, is too great - with newsprint now running at $500 a ton. Besides, nobody sits on the front porch these days reading the paper and watching the evening star. They get Roger Mudd, John Chancellor, and Dan Rather on television for free. Unfortunately they are also stunned by the television pictures of disaster. Reading has gone out of style, for watching is easier and it keeps the children quiet. But it is not necessarily true that the printed word is in decline or that the publication of newspapers is a hopeless proposition. We are in the midst today of the greatest printing revolution since the invention of movable type. With the introduction of computercontrolled photocomposition, and with development of the miraculous offset press, the opportunity for publishing newspapers of limited size and purpose is now greater than at any other time in this century. The coming second urban papers will probably not be general massive backbreakers like the second papers we have today, but probably smaller, specialized publications aimed at a limited audience. The OPEC countries, for example, which are not short of money, are not likely to ignore the possibilities of the Washington audience. Neither are the New Conservatives and the Moral Majority types, who are riding high these days, and will want to publicize their ideas and sustain their present political momentum. So the prospect is not for the death of ideas and the print medium. The new technology has followed the people into the suburbs, and produced the most vigorous local and community press in the history of the nation. Not since the days when the old printers wandered the country with a sack of type on their backs and a gun in their desks, printing their news and convictions, has there been such a time in America when people could afford to defend anything they liked, to publish and be damned. The second big-city dailies are clearly in trouble, but the weeklies, printing the amiable news of marriages and births, and the reunions of families, are somehow surviving the inflation. Accordingly, the death of The Washington Star does not dim the glow of The Evening Star. It endured here for over half the life of the Republic, and broke the hearts of the Noyeses and the Kauffmans in the process, and there is now a lot of silly talk here before the funeral about who killed Cock Robin. The people of the Washington community killed it, that's who! It seems to be the rule of this town that everybody is open to the most savage criticism except the people. Yet the people here were given a really fine afternoon paper, and they didn't support it by their subscriptions or their advertising, and the ironic fact is that so many of those who are now mourning its loss never bought or backed it. But Washington will not be a one-newspaper town, no matter what the obit writers say. Nothing will take the place of The Evening Star, but somebody may rescue its lovely name.  ",

   "input": "The Reader's Digest, which has made a name for independence in the publishing business, says it has no intention of departing from that tradition following the death of its founder, DeWitt Wallace. According to Edward T. Thompson, its editor in chief, while Mr. Wallace was alive, the Digest periodically received overtures from would-be purchasers, but the Digest was never for sale. It is not now, either, Mr. Thompson said in response to a press query. ''We simply have no interest in going public or selling to anybody,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''And we can see no circumstances in the future that would change that.'' Mr. Wallace, who was 91, died March 30 at his home in Mount Kisco in Westchester County. He owned 51 percent of the Digest's voting shares, compared with 49 percent held by his wife, Lila Bell Acheson Wallace, a co-founder of the Digest. Mrs. Wallace, who is 91, now owns all the voting stock, Mr. Thompson said. The company's top officers declined to discuss what arrangements have been made for transfer of that stock at the time of Mrs. Wallace's death. The Wallaces have no children. They did say, however, that the transfer of voting shares to Mrs. Wallace had no estate tax consequences, and, further, that estate taxes would not be a problem upon Mrs. Wallace's death. Successful Formula The Wallaces worked a publishing formula of inspiration, humor, sex, health and self-help into a small compendium of condensed articles that became the world's largest-circulated magazine. Mr. Wallace retired in 1973 as a multimillionaire, with the business also well established elsewhere in book publishing, records and educational material. The Reader's Digest magazine has a worldwide circulation of 30 million, with advertising rates that are the envy of the publishing industry. It is introducing a new magazine in October, and has a toehold in home-computer services. Moreover, with no long-term debt, approximately $1 billion in revenues and ample profits, the Reader's Digest Association Inc., the parent company, could borrow substantial sums, if it so chose. Reader's Digest is decidedly profitable, but its executives decline to give any figures. Mr. Thompson said an after-tax profits estimate of $100 million in 1979 by Business Week magazine was too high, ''nowhere near the reality.'' Along with Mr. Thompson,53, who has been in his post since 1976, the company is headed by John A. O'Hara,52, a native of Scotland steeped in the Digest's foreign expansion, who has been president of the Reader's Digest Association since January 1977. All departments report to Mr. O'Hara, who holds the top command. Mr. Thompson and Mr. O'Hara, along with William J. Cross, vice president and treasurer, guide the company as members of its executive committee. The only nonofficers on Reader's Digest's 14-member board are Harold H. Helm, former chairman of Chemical Bank; Donald Platten, Chemical's present chairman, and Laurance Rockefeller, the philanthropist. In recent years, Reader's Digest has been most active abroad, although its projects are hardly considered aggressive. Earlier this month, it added its 40th edition, in Hindi. The magazine's circulation in the United States is 18 million, with an additional 12 million abroad. The company is introducing a new magazine, Families, in October - a condensed compendium similar to the Digest, except that it will originate one-quarter of its articles. Earlier this year, Reader's Digest entered the home-computer services field when it acquired the Source. The subscription service sells electronic information, such as United Press International and The New York Times's Information Bank, to owners of home computers.

A permanent primary sets a political calendar which is predictable. June is preferable to September because it is fairer to all participtants -voters, candidates and election boards. As proponents of increased voter participation, we also object to the September date because it requires the gathering of signatures on nominating petitions and the conducting of campaigns during the summer months, when interest is generally at a low point. We therefore support the State Senate bill which calls for a June primary this year as a first step toward our ultimate goal of a constitutional amendment establishing a permanent June primary. The Times's statement that there would be three councilmanic elections in three successive years is based on one questionable assumption and one clear error: (1) use of districts based on 1970 figures this year may or may not lead the courts to order a special election next year; (2) regular councilmanic elections are scheduled every four - not two - years.

The encyclical, whose publication was delayed by the attempt on his life in May, is expected to be his broadest social statement to date. John Paul has been critical of the lack of sufficient workers' rights in Communist countries, and although he is not expected to mention the labor unrest in his homeland of Poland specifically, the encyclical is expected to defend workers' rights under any political system. The Pope announced the encyclical, the third of his pontificate, during an address to about 12,000 people outside his summer residence in Castel Gandolfo, just south of Rome, where he is recovering from the assassination attempt. The encyclical was written to commemorate the 90th anniversary of Pope Leo XIII's encyclical ''Rerum Novarum,'' the first social encyclical in the history of the Roman Catholic Church, which dealt with the nature of work. The Pope said he was going to speak about ''Rerum Novarum'' on May 13, the day he was shot in St. Peter's Square, ''but what happened before the start of the audience prohibited me from speaking on this problem.''

   "input": "It isn't essential to be Swedish to direct Strindberg but it can't hurt. So for the Circle in the Square production of the playwright's 1887 classic ''The Father,'' Theodore Mann, the company's artistic director, reached across the Atlantic for Goran Graffman, one of the leading lights of the Royal Dramatic Theater in Stockholm. Yet, Mr. Graffman pointed out during a recent rehearsal here, ''I never directed 'The Father' in Sweden, so it's a new experience for me as well as for the actors. The American actors - including Ralph Waite who plays the captain and Frances Sternhagen who plays his wife, Laura - were relieved, I think, that we all started out on an equal basis. They knew that I was not bringing any rigid ideas about past performances. Anyway, I never wanted to say, 'This is the way we do Strindberg in Stockholm.' '' ''The Father'' is now in previews preparatory to opening on April 2. Mr. Graffman didn't seem rattled by the fact that he is the first Swedish director to be invited to work with Circle in the Square. Except for one play in Finland, he has not directed outside his own country. But his reputation as actor and director preceded him when he met Mr. Mann last summer while on a visit to New York. 'Acting Gives Perception ''I feel that directors who are actors have an extra perception,'' Mr. Mann said, discussing his reasons for wanting Mr. Graffman to stage ''The Father.'' Harry G. Carlson, the Strindberg scholar who is a professor of drama at Queens College and at the City University's Graduate Center, was asked to provide a modern translation. It turned out that Mr. Graffman and Mr. Carlson knew each other's work, and the production fell into place. The 49-year-old director, casually sweatered and wearing only one Eighth Avenue touch - cowboy boots -sounded modest and cautious about his own role in doing Strindberg on a New York stage, emphasizing that the performers have to carry the main burden of the play - and that he greatly admired the speed and ability of this American cast. ''One of the big differences between putting on a play here and at home is in rehearsal time. In Stockholm, we rehearse for a longer stretch - anywhere between nine and 12 weeks - while here we had only three weeks and four days. In Stockholm, an actor can go home and think about his part very slowly - you flow into a role; in New York, an actor has to jump right in. A Different Complexion ''That difference gives a different complexion to the play,'' Mr. Graffman said. ''All the vital questions are directed at me very early by the cast. And I had to come up with the answers very fast. Analysis and blocking out of the moves start practically from the beginning. The actors all learned their lines in two weeks. In Sweden, it often takes a month.'' Mr. Graffman said that a major reason for the luxury of time is that most professional Swedish actors are steadily rather than erratically engaged; that plays aren't one-shot affairs but the outgrowth of state theater school training and, afterward, steady work in a variety of roles with permanent theater companies. ''I myself have been under contract for 25 years - practically my whole life as an actor and director. I'm with the Royal Dramatic Theater, our national theater. We have three state schools, and each one graduates 12 to 15 actors - meaning 45 finished actors a year. Most of them get jobs right away. Can Go Back to School ''We have another important element in our national theater system,'' Mr. Graffman added. ''Established actors and directors can return to brush up their skills and to learn new ones. It's like taking a sabbatical from your regular theater job and going back to school. Five or six actors take advantage of it every year. I did so recently as a director and tried something experimental: I put on 'Waiting for Godot' with women in the roles. Yes, it seemed to work quite well.'' Besides doing the translation of ''The Father,'' Mr. Carlson is also serving Mr. Graffman's production as dramaturg - a role he defines as ''a kind of literary adviser - somewhere in between the original author and an assistant director.'' ''This is how we work together,'' Mr. Carlson explained at the rehearsal. ''Mr. Graffman, the director, is down on the floor, finetuning, and I sit back and watch the language. You have to make adjustments for a modern audience. For example, if you rang a bell for a servant in the 19th century, when this play was written, he could appear instantly. Today, you have to ring it a bit earlier because it would look dated if a servant jumped to attention. Instead, he strolls into the scene. I think that all great plays have to be retranslated so they relate to their own audiences.'' Silent on Interpretation Mr. Graffman was reluctant to talk about how he was interpreting ''The Father'' since he wanted to leave as much as possible to the audience's imagination. But he did say that, right from the start, he and Mr. Carlson had to come to grips with the prevailing view that ''The Father'' is anti-feminist. Their joint answer - in response to the question about Strindberg's attitude toward women that was raised by the actors the very first day of rehearsals - is, No. With raised consciousness about equal rights for women in 1981 - far more than in 1912, when ''The Father'' was the first Strindberg play to be performed in English in the United States - the drama has historic meaning today. The matter of Strindberg's misogyny was noted nearly 70 years ago by one critic, Alan Dale, who wrote in The New York American: ''No more sinister picture of malevolent womanhood has ever been staged.'' 'Sounds Like Beckett' The director said, ''Strindberg was a precursor, like the Absurdists. Some of the things he wrote sound like Beckett. In 'The Father,' there are certain comparisons to marriage that make it sound like a business transaction. But that does not make it anti-feminist. Frequently, Laura is seen as a monster in the marriage with the captain, and the 'The Father' is considered a kind of 'mad' play. ''But I've told the actors that this play has a timeless feeling. Even though social conditions have changed, the things Strindberg had to say still count. I don't think that we have come any closer to solving marriage problems - the way men and women shatter each other. What we are doing here is underscoring the relevant in Strindberg.'' The same universality that Mr. Graffman said he was striving for could in fact be found in Strindberg's own writing about his plays: ''My souls (or characters) are conglomerates, made up of past and present stages of civilization, scraps of humanity, torn-off pieces of Sunday clothing turned into rags - all patched together as is the human soul itself. I do not believe in simple characters on the stage.'' Illustrations: Photo of Goran Graffman  ",

In a tribute to Mr. Evans, who died last September, Marian McPartland will play some of his best known compositions tonight at the Cafe Carlyle on 76th Street and Madison Avenue. Miss McPartland, who counts herself among the many jazz pianists influenced by the classically trained Mr. Evans, recalled the rhythmic excitement of his playing and his gift for melody. Even his ''Twelve Tone Tune,'' an arrangement of the 12 chromatic pitches, is, well, tuneful, she said. ''He liked investigating all possibilities of chord changes in a tune before he put it in his repertory; he was a very careful person,'' she recalled. Although Mr. Evans was generally regarded as shy, Miss McPartland recalled that he was in fact very articulate and also funny when she once interviewed him on her radio show. Recounting some of the distracting incidents suffered by supper club artists, she said, he told of a time at the Village Vanguard - where he frequently played - when he paused to consider what tune to play next and a waiter carrying drinks strode between Mr. Evans and the keyboard. Accompanied by Steve LaSpina on bass and Charles Braugham on drums, Miss McPartland will play such Evans pieces as ''Twelve Tone Tune,'' ''Waltz for Debbie,'' ''B Minor,'' ''Very Early,'' ''Turn Out the Stars'' and ''Time Remembered.'' She also plans to play tunes written in tribute to Mr. Evans by George Shearing and Barbara Carroll and to improvise one herself. There will be two shows, at 9:45 and 11:45 P.M. There is a $5 cover charge. For reservations, call 744-1600. CELEBRATION CONCERT Stormin' Norman plays the piano and writes the songs, Suzy sings them, they also do skits and the two of them are quite mad. The music is a combination of blues and rock-and-roll and the songs include a reverse striptease in which she puts on clothes. She also wears eccentric clothes with feathers and strange hats and carries a teapot over her arm instead of a purse. The pair, whose regular names are Suzie Williams and Norman Zamcheck, will appear, probably with a saxophone player, at the Union-Washington Houses Community Center at 98th Street and Third Avenue today at 1 P.M. - on the lawn or inside if it rains - and everybody is invited to attend without charge. The event celebrates the Union Settlement, an 87-year-old organization that offers job training, recreation and other services to East Harlem residents of all ages. It also celebrates the successful conclusion of the city's youth employment program in which young people work for nonprofit organizations. BANK FULL OF CATS New Yorkers accustomed to selecting digital clocks and silverware in their banks as a reward for depositing portions of their savings may reach the wrong conclusion if they enter the Manhattan Savings Bank at 47th and Madison Avenue at lunchtime. Some 20 purebred cats of varying lineage and voice will be found in the lounge but they won't be given away. They will be there for show. Persians, Siamese, Russian Blues, an Abyssinian, a Turkish Angora - 16 breeds in all - will allow themselves to be looked at from noon to 1:30 P.M. through Friday, with Richard Gebhardt, a noted cat judge, there to comment on them. Why? Well, why not? The bank has offered other noontime entertainment - piano playing and magic shows, for instance - for some time now and has presented dog shows in April for 20 years. The aim, a spokesman said, is ''to please the public.'' For Sports Today, see page C4. Eleanor Blau Illustrations: photo of Marian MacPartland  ",

   "input": "For the second time in three days, a high-ranking deputy in New York City's Transportation Department has resigned. City Hall officials indicated yesterday that other departures could follow, and Mayor Koch said he was unhappy about snarled traffic conditions on city streets. ''It's no secret that I was not happy with the bottom line on what the transportation agency has accomplished over the last four years,'' Mr. Koch said. Yesterday's resignation was submitted by David Love, the first deputy commissioner, who has been in city government for 15 years. On Monday, Thomas J. Guthrie, a 23-year veteran, resigned as a deputy commissioner in charge of the Bureau of Traffic Operations. Neither man is believed to be leaving with a specific new job in mind. Aides to the Mayor turned aside suggestions that a shake-up of the department was under way, but they said further changes were possible among the four remaining deputy commissioners, who are responsible for highways, marine and aviation operations, research and the Parking Violations Bureau. For now, the aides said, the Tranportation Commissioner, Anthony R. Ameruso, was not himself in danger of losing his job. ''I've been around a while,'' said Mr. Ameruso, also a veteran of municipal service. ''I read signals. I like to take initiatives because otherwise you don't survive.'' But he insisted that he had not requested the resignations of Mr. Guthrie and Mr. Love, and that neither had the Mayor's office. He acknowledged, though, that he welcomed their departures as an opportunity to ''bring in new blood.'' A Chance to Get More Involved The resignations also give Mr. Koch his first opportunity to pursue his announced policy of becoming more personally involved in selecting deputies in municipal agencies. In his first four years in office, the Mayor left it to his commissioners to choose their lieutenants, but he has said in recent weeks that this policy was about to change. The development in the Transportation Department came as Bruce C. Ratner resigned after nearly four years as the city's Consumer Affairs Commissioner. Mr. Ratner, who had been saying privately for some time that he wanted to leave, said he had no specific plans and would remain at the city agency for up to two more months. His announcement, coupled with previous resignations, meant that the Mayor had four commissioner posts to fill, none of them in what are generally regarded as the top-level departments. Several appointments are expected before Mr. Koch takes the oath of office for a second term on Jan. 1. City officials said no decisions had been made. However, Robert M. Litke, now a deputy commissioner, is considered a likely choice for the No. 1 job in the Department of General Services, while Robert A. Kandel, the Mayor's representative on the Board of Estimate, is a leading candidate to head the Office of Economic Development. An Environmental Vacancy The other vacancy is in the Department of Environmental Protection, where Joseph T. McGough Jr., the first deputy commissioner, was recently made acting commissioner and is being considered for the permanent job along with another deputy, Jeffrey Sommer. With the Transportation Department, the Mayor's dissatisfaction reportedly stems from persistent traffic congestion on city streets despite such measures as special bus lanes on Madison Avenue, reverse lanes at the Queens-Midtown Tunnel and stepped-up ticketing of double-parkers in midtown Manhattan. In September, the Mayor's Management Report - the administration's report card on itself - said that crosstown traffic speeds in Manhattan had increased from 4.4 to 5.2 miles per hour since last January. However, the 5.2 figure was still well below the 6 or 7 miles per hour that had been the accepted standard for decades, and Mr. Ameruso said that since September traffic speeds have declined -as they usually do in the holiday season. The Commissioner blamed such forces as the heavy construction activity in midtown and the deterioration of the subways, which he believes has contributed in the last year to a 15 percent increase in the number of vehicles entering Manhattan south of 60th Street. Deputy Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. said that Mr. Koch's unhappiness centered on enforcement of traffic rules. Referring to this week's resignations, Mr. Wagner said: ''The general feeling is that Ameruso is a decent guy who's done a lot of thing real well. What's been said to him is that the agency could do better and this is his effort to do that.''  ",

   "input": "WASHINGTON, Sept. 19 2014 John Layden, white plastic hard hat in one hand, a ham-and-cheese sandwich in the other, sat on a grassy incline on the Mall today, thinking of the irony of it all. He was at a protest rally in Washington. ''I thought the protest marches were for kids who had too much time on their hands,'' said Mr. Laden, a carpenter and father of five from Florham Park, N.J. ''The kids would come down here, have riots, smoke marijuana and tear down the system.'' But here was Mr. Laden, 50 years old, sitting 25 yards from the Washington Monument as the banners and the angry slogans snapped in the air. He had left home at 3 A.M. with about 300 other members of the New Jersey Council of Carpenters to join the thousands in labor's Solidarity Day march and rally. ''I'm angry and disappointed,'' he said. ''This is America. This Government is supposed to represent the people back home. They're trying to put the working man down. They're trying to make this a different kin d of country.'' First March of the 1980's It was the first major protest march of the 1980's, and though the marchers took the traditional parade route and sang some of the traditional slogans, there was little similarity to the large civil rights and antiwar protests of the 1960's and 70's. The soundtrack was Country and Western, not folk rock, and the marchers tended to smoke Marlboros, not marijuana. Mildred Donahue, a librarian in the Peck Place Elementary School in Orange, Conn., flew here to join the march. ''I'm not a radical,'' said Mrs. Donahue, 58. ''But Ronald Reagan made me come here. I wanted to make the point that this Administration doesn't have a mandate for what they're doing.'' Today's march under the blue-gray skies of the nation's capital was Mrs. Donahue's introduction to the politics of protest. A slight, graying woman dressed smartly in a green blazer, she took her place among the glaziers, painters, sanitation workers, machinists and pipefitters who swelled onto the city's streets. Meanwhile, the call to solidarity that the crowd had gathered to hear came from the speakers' platform. ''We raise children,'' came the voice from across the Mall, and people from the West Side Community Mental Health Center in Cleveland clenched their fists and cheered. ''We send them to school,'' came the voice again. Again the group from Cleveland cheered. ''We don't have enough money,'' the speaker went on. And Judy Hadden, an occupational therapist at the mental health center, yelled back, ''You're absolutely right.'' Mrs. Hadden almost did not come to Washington. She is divorced, she has three children and because, as she put it, it is ''always time to buy new shoes for the kids,'' she could not afford the gas to drive from Cleveland. But she and a dozen others from the mental health center chipped in for gas, met at a parking lot near Lake Erie, stuffed a van and a car with food and headed east. ''All my kids are college material and I'm raising them on $15,000 a year,'' Mrs. Hadden said. ''I want them to go to college, but there simply isn't the money for that. I can't save anything, and Reagan's putting the financial pressure on us.'' Concern for Agency Services But it was not only their personal finances that moved the group to join the Solidarity Day march, they said. They also came to protest Administration budget cuts that have forced their agency to cut staff and services. Though the march and rally were organized by the labor movement, it was not just union members who stood to sing songs like ''I'm Sticking to the Union'' and who followed parade marshals up Constitution Avenue to the West Front of the Capitol, where eight months ago President Reagan was inaugurated amid cheers and bunting. Today's march was a curious potpourri of protest. The Pittsburgh Central American Mobilization Committ ee march ed to protest American involvement in El Salvador, the Marxist and L eninist USA Party marched to protest capitalism. The DC Area Fe minist Alliance marched in support of women's rights and the National Coalition of Black Gaysmarched as well. But most were people like Bruce Cavano, a steamfitter from Washington, who marched with four American flags sticking out of his pockets and from his union banner. ''Everything we stand for is under attack,'' he said. ''Look who's here,'' said Pat De Temple, a laid-off union organizer from Boston who participated in many protest marches of the last two decades. ''These people are older. They're all working people. I've been to 20 different demonstrations. There hasn't been one like this before.'' Karen Slaney, a legal services attorney from Cambridge, Mass., added: ''It's a sense of emergency that you feel here. I think it's thrilling.'' They came, as Washington-bound protesters almost always do, by bus - hundreds of them, filling the major highways and causing congestion at roadside rest and food centers. Scores left in motorcades from New York, a gray, yellow and orange armada that began rolling into Washington at 11:30. ''Wait until you see what's coming after us,'' said Judy Phillips, an official with the enforcement division of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The excitement was too much for some of them. Pat Moore, a garment worker from Effingham, Ill., was so overwhelmed by the crowd that she had to sit down. ''It makes me mad,'' said Mrs. Moore, 55. ''I'm worried that there are too many imports and too high taxes and too much talk abo ut Social Security cutbacks.'' As she sat by the Washington Monument, and as hawkers milled about selling buttons, banners and balloons, the human river flowed east toward the Capitol, where more speeches and chants awaited them. The unions joined the parade one by one, the standards flying in the brisk wind and the marshals barking their instructions.

   "input": "BEIRUT, Lebanon, June 21 2014 Barely seventeen months ago, Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, was elected Iran's first President with a stunning 75 per cent landslide. Today, he is in hiding, his enemies in the Parliament having voted him incompetent, his remaining supporters fighting last-ditch street battles, mobs crying for his death and a warrant out for his arrest. The turnabout is perhaps less surprising than it might seem on the surface. The fall of the hapless presidency of Mr. Bani-Sadr is rooted in the peculiar history of Iran that lent passion to the struggle between the liberals surrounding Mr. Bani-Sadr and the clergy-led religious traditionalists of the Islamic Republican Party. Mr. Bani-Sadr was rendered powerless almost from the beginning, so that today's action was more of a coup de grace than a coup d'etat. While Mr. Bani-Sadr and the moderates in Iran who supported him held the ostensible offices of Government, the clerics were building their power through the new revolutionary institutions: the secret, clergy-dominated Revolutionary Council, the groups of militant students, the neighborhood committees, which enforced a kind of vigilante order, the revolutionary guards, and, finally, through the loosely organized Islamic Republican Party, with its network of mosques and Friday prayer leaders who in Shiite Moslem tradition speak on political issues, and, eventually, the Parliament. And, when the clergymen deemed it necessary, they had the street mobs, the hezbollahis, who have been particularly active the past few days battling liberals and leftists with fists, clubs and knives. Hezbollahi means ''follower of the party of God,'' a name that comes from one of their favorite chants - in Persian, it rhymes - ''The only leader is Ruhollah; the only party is the party of God.'' The chant refers to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the dominant figure of the revolution that overthrew the Shah. The struggle on one level was between the Westernized exiles who surrounded Ayatollah Khomeini near Paris in the last stages of his campaign to overthrow the Shah - primarily Mr. Bani-Sadr and former foreign ministers Sadegh Ghotbzadeh and Ibrahim Yazdi - and the local mullahs, or religious teachers, who led the neighborhood committees and revolutionary guards in setting up their own form of government. While many of the liberals were devout Moslems, to the fundamentalist they were tainted with Western ideas and secularism that threatened the traditional powers of religion. The struggle between the irreconcilable wings of the revolution - religious traditionalism and Western modernism - has been a pattern running through Persian nationalism for the last century. Four times a disparate coalition that brought together clergy and bazaar merchants on one hand and Westernized students, intellectuals and civil servants on the other has overthrown local despots and foreign domination, only to collapse in discord. Personal Failings Played Part Part of Mr. Bani-Sadr's failure was personal. While his main opponent, Ayatollah Mohammed Beheshti, the leader of the Islamic Republicans and chief justice of the Supreme Court, proved a tough and wily infighter, Mr. Bani-Sadr, who seemed the caricature of a vague, diffident academic, was never able to get his act together. Mr. Bani-Sadr's major failure was in not developing a party structure or any other institution that supported him. His election was, in a sense, a fluke, because the main Islamic Republican candidates were withdrawn at the last minute, his name was known from his lecture tours and he had avoided condemnation by staying out of the provisional Government. In office, he failed to consolidate his position. Mr. Bani-Sadr was swiftly undercut by Ayatollah Beheshti's ruling that the constitutional provision that gave the Parliament the right to approve the President's nominee for prime minister actually meant that the legislators would chose the head of Government. The cleargydominated Parliament forced him to accept the Islamic Republicans' man, Mohammed Ali Rajai, whom he termed unqualified. In his position as Commander in Chief, Mr. Bani-Sadr experienced a brief comeback with the Iraqi invasion. He took to spending nearly all his time at the front, and posters showed him eating from a mess kit with common soldiers, his bespectacled, professorial features somewhat incongruous in combat gear. But there were sharp setbacks in recent days. His newspaper, in which he wrote a popular feature called ''President's Diary,'' a remarkable document in which a head of state complained of his powerlessness and the success with which his enemies plotted, was ordered closed. His ally, Ali Reza Nobari, the central bank director, was forced to resign. The Parliament approved a bill to require him to sign bills within five days, or else they would become law anyway. Most importantly, he appeared to have lost the ear of Ayatollah Khomeini, still the sole source of political legitimacy, who had often in the past kept the contending forces in balance. The Ayatollah stripped Mr. Bani Sadr of his position as Commander in Chief, leaving him vulnerable to the final attack. Whether the clergy will be able to institutionalize and keep its power - particularly if the 81-year-old Ayatollah Khomeini should die - remains to be seen.  ",

   "input": "New Jersey's Governor-elect Thomas Kean says several people he seeks for his administration are reluctant to accept appointment because they cannot afford cuts in pay. That's why he backs a state commission report recommending substantial raises for the Governor, Cabinet members and judges. Mr. Kean, a businessman, knows that talent is costly but worth the price. That is a laudable position. Although the pay of public workers in recent years has not kept up with inflation, politicians who must vote on pay increases continue to fear public complaints that government employees earn too much. Especially in times of austerity, lawmakers prefer to dodge the issue, simply refusing to address it directly until the political climate seems more favorable. But that is self-defeating; an outdated pay scale saps the quality of government, with the result that everyone suffers. Thus Mr. Kean, who in his campaign called for cuts in spending, shows commendable candor and pragmatism in backing the raises for New Jersey officials. The proposed schedule would raise the Governor's pay to $100,000 from $65,0, Cabinet members to $70,000 from $56,0, and add $15,000 to the salaries of state judges. The Governor-elect, a millionaire, hardly needs the extra money, and he promises to contribute the amount of his raise to charity. He has no reason to feel embarrassed.  ",

   "input": "WASHINGTON, March 28 2014 The roles ranged from Mickey Mouse to Marilyn Monroe, and the audience consisted of stars, too, including President Reagan, Mrs. Reagan and the leaders of government and business. The annual ritual included a chorus line of nationally known journalists tap-dancing on stage, wearing white ties and tails and swinging canes. This year's cast had such members as David Broder of The Washington Post, Albert R. Hunt of The Wall Street Journal and Helen Thomas of United Press International. All this marked the 96th annual Gridiron Club dinner tonight at the Capitol Hilton Hotel. It is the oldest and most prestigious of a number of official and unofficial soirees sponsored by Washington journalists for the purpose of massaging their powerful sources. Members of the news media have always entertained newsmakers, ever since the first Washington correspondent bought a Congressman a cup of coffee. But as competition among the city's 2,773 news-gathering organizations has increased in recent years, so has the nature and extent of their entertaining. And so have the questions. ''Where do you draw the line?'' asked Fred Friendly, a former president of CBS News, professor emeritus at the Columbia School of Journalism. ''It's reached almost epidemic proportions in Washington,'' he said, referring to the news-media parties. ''It's taken two centuries for journalists to become independent. I don't want to see us lose that.'' What concerns Mr. Friendly and others are events like the lavish sit-down dinner for 400 last January that was sponsored by the Times Mirror Company, which owns The Los Angeles Times and other publishing and television outlets. The dinner was held at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, and the guest of honor was Senator Howard H. Baker Jr., Republican of Tennessee, who was celebrating his first day as Senate majority leader. The dinner drew criticism from, among others, a critic for The Los Angeles Times. ''The question being asked around here was, 'Is The Times having a party because they're hoping to get Baker's assistance on legislation involving cable TV?,' '' David Shaw said. ''I was told not. But I just don't think newspapers should be in the business of giving testimonial dinners for politicians.'' Times Mirror was not the only news organization to give a party in January at the time of Ronald Reagan's inaguration. Time Inc., whose properties include Time magazine and The Washington Star, was the host for a reception for 300 Government and business figures the night before the inauguration. A few days earlier, NBC-TV entertained many of the same people at a Sunday brunch for 400 at the Four Seasons Hotel. Spring Calendar Is Full The spring calendar is also crammed with social events sponsored by news organizations. Among them are the annual dinners of the Radio and Television Correspondents Association (last Thursday night), the White House Correspondents Association (April 25) and the White House News Photographers Association (May 20). Scores of hotel-suite cocktail receptions, each sponsored by a different news organization, have been scheduled in conjunction with all of these dinners, including tonight's Gridiron Club dinner. Last night Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, publisher of The New York Times, gave his annual cocktail party for members of the paper's Washington bureau and friends and acquaintances of the publisher, including some present and former Government officials. Among the more than 100 guests at the Metropolitan Club party were Vice President Bush, Chief Justice Warren Burger and former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, Paul Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and David A. Stockman, director of the Office of Management and Budget. The event that has drawn the most attention was a dinner party held by George Will last November. In October Mr. Will, a nationally syndicated columnist, helped prepare Ronald Reagan for his campaign debate with Jimmy Carter. After Mr. Reagan won the election, Mr. Will was the host at a star-studded dinner in the President's honor at the Will home. 'Little Moral Thermometers' When some of Mr. Will's colleagues questioned whether such actions threatened his journalistic objectivity, the columnist dismissed his critics in print as ''little moral thermometers'' who are spreading ''a silly scrupulosity.'' The rumblings over Mr. Will's activities did not end there. ''A journalist who wishes to dine intimately with the most powerful of his sources is in double jeopardy,'' said William Shawcross, a British journalist, writing about the Will affair. ''The prison of Georgetown is very comfortable.'' It is common in Washington for journalists to view themselves as celebrities. ''If you imbibe the air, the atmosphere of Henry Kissinger, when is the point when you put on a team jacket?'' said Hodding Carter 3d, who, as a former State Department spokesman and a former newspaperman, has worked both sides of the fence. ''Journalists in Washington have come to see themselves not as a reflector of the might but as a participator, as one of the mighty.'' Tonight members of the Gridiron Club sat side by side with the mighty, including senators, top Administration officials and the chairmen of the board of General Motors and Ford. Members of the Gridiron Club are Washington correspondents of newspapers and press associations. They invite the dinner guests, many of whom are high-ranking Government officials, including the President and Cabinet officers. It is estimated that the cost per guest for the cocktail party preceding the dinner, the dinner itself and a repeat performance tomorrow afternoon is $100. That sum is usually paid by the club member's employer. According to nearly century-old ritual, members and guests of the Gridiron Club listen to the music of the Marine Corps Band, sit through the serving of the terrapin soup and watch skits that satirize the mighty. ''It's good fellowship,'' said Grant Dillman, a Gridiron member who is Washington bureau chief for United Press International. ''If this should result in an access at some time, well, why not?'' The dinner called for a finale with everyone clasping hands and singing ''Auld Lang Syne.''  ",

Sue Berkman, editor of a new magazine called Columbus Ave., which is sponsoring the event, notes that ''most adults on the Upper West Side were once children'' and says that the event will give them a chance to rekindle their memories of stickball, potsy, marbles, jacks, Red Rover and Double Dutch. She also wants to kindle interest among today's children, many of whom ''spend more time pumping quarters into video games than playing in the sunshine.'' Saturday NEW HAVEN REMEMBERS Benedict Arnold, best known as a traitor, will be honored in New Haven on Saturday as the hero of Powderhouse Day, which has been celebrated there for 78 years. It commemorates the day in 1775 when Arnold demanded the keys to the New Haven Powderhouse, got munitions and marched off with his troops to fight the British. In full Colonial regalia, the 170-member Governor's Foot Guard, founded by Arnold, will re-enact the confrontation on the New Haven Green. A guard spokesman explained that Arnold's later alleged betrayal was a matter of controversy, but that there was no question of his valor on Powderhouse Day.

   "input": "Over the past few years, the millennial workforce conversation has taken center stage in the media. While this group will be in the workforce for at least 30 more years, there is a new generation on deck causing prospective employers to take notice: Generation Z. Getting ready to step up to the plate, Gen Z will be just as focused and driven as millennials, however, their definition of a 201cgood employer 201d will vary in some important areas. Generation Z is classified as those who were born in the mid-90s to early 201800s. Much like the generation before them, Gen Z is driven, but according to the recent 2015 Way To Work survey by Adecco Staffing USA, their aspirations differ from those of millennials. Despite the stigma around millennial workers feeling entitled, many aspire to be financially stable, a desire that may likely be tied to them entering the workforce in the deepest part of the recession. Gen Z, however, is focused on their dream job. In fact, the majority (32%) of Gen Z surveyed stated their greatest aspiration is to be in their dream job within 10 years from now. They don 2019t expect finding a job to be easy though, as many of today 2019s students (32%) report finding a job as their top concern. Student debt is on the list as well, with 21% of those surveyed being most concerned about the cost of education and the lasting financial impact it can have on their future. In fact, more than half (53%) of current students report that student loan debt is a major consideration in their schooling and career decisions. In spite of this concern, many students (36%) are more focused on the opportunity for growth rather than salary when it comes to their first job. While many businesses are touting friendly workplace cultures with flexible schedules and transparent salaries in order to lure talent, they may need to offer more career focused perks instead for Gen Z. Today 2019s college students ranked opportunity for career growth as the most important aspect of their first job (36%) followed by fulfilling work (19%) and stability (19%). Friendly work environments (10%), flexible schedules (7%), and the highest salary (6%) rank lower in priority. To attract the right talent, organizations will have to show how they can help their employees reach their most important career goals. Yet perhaps the biggest obstacle will be retaining these employees. Any company is susceptible to losing talent if employees aren 2019t engaged in the work they do or committed to the organization they work for. With Gen Z in particular, job hopping could be a major concern as 83% of today 2019s students believe that three years or less is the appropriate amount of time to spend at their first job. Furthermore, over a quarter (27%) of students believe you should stay at your first job for a year or less. By providing effective and frequent training, as well as professional development opportunities, employers can help their greatest assets 2013their employees 2013find a niche within the company and maintain a high level of engagement and retention. Encouraging professional development opportunities outside the office can also be beneficial. Giving your employees the opportunity to attend career-focused conferences and expos allows them to step out of their comfort zone, network with other professionals, and bring their learnings back to the organization. Job shadowing is another way to give employees well-rounded training. Allowing employees to shadow their colleagues in other departments is an easy way for them to learn new skills. It will also give them a greater understanding of the company as a whole and encourage growth within the organization. Without question, Gen Z has big aspirations for the future and are motivated to climb the ladder. Knowing professional development and growth opportunities are essential to their success, Gen Z will prioritize companies that are engaging and encouraging over those that are not. By appealing to Gen Z 2019s desire to learn while offering opportunities for substantial growth, employers can successfully attract and retain the next generation of talent stepping up to the plate.

So are the real Fox comedy's cast and crew. He's wonderful , costar Mary Elizabeth Ellis ,36, told PEOPLE on Sunday at the ATX Television Festival in Austin, Texas. He's super professional and fun and funny. , who plays his brother, actual attorney Stewart Sanderson. The new series's writers and executive producers agree. I find myself not able to concentrate sometimes , Jarrad Paul said. Like , I'll pause. He talks , I don't hear anything, Andrew Mogel added. I'm just staring. Their conclusion? When the Brat Packer speaks , You just hear birds chirping , Savage ,38, said. Angels laughing! Fan-girling aside , all four admit there's more to than Lowe's gorgeous looks. It's a family and workplace show that's genuinely funny and speaks to father-son dynamics sure to resonate with viewers. After working hard his whole life, Stewart finds his future threatened when Dean decides to take a stab at the lawyer thing off screen 2013 and their dad (William Devane) may not turn over the firm to Stewart just yet. Rob's character's approach to law , he probably knows more of the words, more of the dramatic aspects of law. Because most law, at least in their firm, most law in general is kind of boring. It's a lot of drudgery, it's a lot of paperwork, it's a lot of settling and a lot of arbitration, Savage explained. You never want to go to court! And so there's not a lot of grandstanding for Stewart's legal practice. But Rob , it's all about the performance, because on TV, no one wants to see people just grinding out paperwork. You want to see the big closing argument or the surprise witness or those moments that make you gasp as you cut to commercial. There's also the meta aspect: a successful actor playing a successful actor , a TV show existing within a TV show. We found it was so fun to shoot the fake show , we could do that all the time, Paul said. And just the fact that this guy lives in this TV drama and brings that TV drama to this small-town , mundane world, we find very enjoyable. Paul and Mogel riff on almost every procedural imaginable in the script , listing I think that's something that adds to the freshness of the show. It doesn't pretend that there's not a world of television out there , Savage said. There's so many times where I'll watch a movie or a television show and I'll be like , 'But that's Rob Lowe! Why is no one saying, I know who you are?' Or , as Paul posited: Like in not exist in that world? I don't know why people are so afraid of that world , of acknowledging that it exists, Mogel said. It's to Fox's credit , for letting us do that. Because there's a lot of people that don't like that. You get a lot of , 'Oh, it's too inside,' or something like that, Savage finished.

   "input": "can't help but think about her dad, who lost his battle with lung cancer seven years ago. It's still very tough for me and my whole family , This Father's Day , Daniel,39, who battled and overcame cancer herself, is remembering her father in a very special way, in a touching blog post on as an ambassador for the non-profit, I wanted to honor him , she says. We were all very close as a family. She said she wrote the blog because she wanted to thank her dad , Charlton Bradford (C.B.) Daniel, for the strength he gave her to fight her own battle with Stage IV non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which she learned she had in 2011, three years after her father died at age 69. We lost him and then I found out I had cancer , so that was tough on our family, she says. He was the strongest man I know. He was like , 'I'm fine. I'll get through this.' My dad's motto was, 'You can get through anything once you set your mind to it. It was a motto she took to heart when she fought cancer herself. When you have cancer , you are pretty scared, she says. You think you are going to die. I was Stage IV. I was really bad off. But I remember thinking , 'I am getting through this. I am not dying from this.' And I think that that is so my dad. That is my dad's strength. I remember just going into this warrior mode. I just feel like that was my dad. I feel like he was a big part of me getting through it , even though he wasn 00e2 0080 0099t there. She underwent chemotherapy 2013 and beat the cancer. What I've found is that life is so much better than it was before , she says. I live life to the fullest. My perspective is very different than it was before. She didn 00e2 0080 0099t speak publicly about her bout with cancer until 2014. We were all so raw from my dad passing away that we kept it private for a while. She has come forward now because she wants to help raise awareness about the need for cancer research and to help others , just as others helped her during her darkest moments. I remember when I was in the waiting room waiting to get a check up while I was undergoing my treatment , she says. I was at my lowest point. I had no hair and was so sick. One of the patients put her hand on my shoulder and said , 'You're going to be okay.' A lot of other people had said that to me, but having that woman who had gone through it say that to me meant so much to me. She gave me so much hope and now I want to give other people hope. In between working 2013 she is on the current season of the BET series and is in the upcoming movie , which comes out next month 2013 she has been working with organizations like Stand Up to Cancer. She said she was thrilled to attend the American Association for Cancer Research's annual meeting in April, when Stand Up To Cancer and the American Cancer Society announced the formation of a $20 million Dream Team, which will focus on researching new therapies in the battle against lung cancer, which claimed the life of her father and her grandfather. Stand Up to Cancer is amazing , she says. They are doing a lot with immunotherapy and are putting together these dream teams by getting all these top scientists and researchers from all over the world to work together and collaborate. I have to say right now it's been a really beautiful experience to be speaking up about lung cancer. It feels very healing to talk about my dad and to be helping others.  ",

   "input": "Running a union and battling for workers' pay and benefits is a full-time job for the typical American labor boss. But the president of the court officers union also runs ice skating rinks, food concessions, beachside parking lots and political campaigns. Dennis Quirk draws no union salary, accepts barely $5,000 in annual expenses and makes $56, 625-a-year from his job as a state court officer. But he's also landed numerous New York City contracts and parlayed them into a family-owned business fiefdom he says grosses $1. 8 million a year. I don't hide it , he told the Daily News. I've got a head for business. Known as president for life because of his unchallenged 29-year reign as chief of the New York State Court Officers Association , Quirk is also regarded as the King of Courts. A hugely influential player in the politically charged court system, he's got a reputation for making judges quake - and a record of successfully running four campaigns for Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes, mostly from his union office. This is a guy who could probably run General Motors - and maybe Ford and Chrysler at the same time , said Hynes. Everyone in labor , politics and business should keep a picture of Dennis Quirk in their wallet, said former Gov. Mario Cuomo. He's a reminder you can be successful without people saying you're greedy , unethical or dishonest. The detractors Not everyone agrees , including the leadership of the State Supreme Court Officers Association, which represents court officers who are not in Quirk's union and have clashed with him for decades over turf and personality issues. He's built a business empire and become a rich man , and his role as president for life of his union helped make it possible, said Jimmy Carr , the head of the State Supreme Court Officers Association. Adds Charles Compton, a past president of the rival union, Dennis is the modern-day Tammany Hall boss of the New York State court system. Loud , proud, gregarious and foul-mouthed, Quirk seems to know each of his 1,500 members by name, fights ferociously to better their lives, attends their weddings, christenings and wakes and pays for their funerals with union funds. In 12 hours of interviews over a week, he told The News how he tied up one alcoholic court officer with rope to deliver him to a detox center. He personally examined the dental charts or X-rays of several members to determine how much his union's health plan would shell out in benefits. He also told of the rough-and-tumble of union life: How his car was firebombed on Staten Island by disgruntled ex-court officers, and how he'd once hung a judge in effigy, black robes and all, from a Columbus Circle lamppost to protest his treatment of court officers. To me , a union is just like a business, he said. My customers are the court officers , and I've got to perform for them by giving the best service I possibly can. Old-style power Ample in girth and skilled in blarney , the 53-year-old, Bay Ridge, Brooklyn-born Quirk is a throwback to a vanished era of the streetwise union chief who ruled by force of personality and cut an enormous swath in the life of the city. Yet few New Yorkers are aware of the extent of his power and influence in the arenas of politics, the judiciary and business. Quirk's privately held company, Staten Island-based City Ice Sports Inc., has run the World's Fair Ice Skating Rink in Queens since 1980, the War Memorial Rink on Staten Island since 1981 and the Abe Stark Rink in Coney Island since 1992. Elected union president in 1974 when he was just 24 years old, Quirk won his first city contract three years later, a concession from the Parks Department to run a snack bar in Manhattan Beach. He also operates mobile food carts and a 950-car parking lot at the site, and under the terms of a contract renewal inked in 2002 for seven years, he'll pay $2. 1 million to the city by 2008 to lease the property. The principal stockholders of City Ice - which employs 45 people in the winter and 25 in the summer - are Quirk, his wife, Doreen, and three of his daughters, Janet, Keri and Susan, according to corporate filings. An ex-stockholder is his mother, Alice. Quirk says the firm grosses $1. 8 million annually and will pay the Parks Department $615,000 for leases this year. Deduct $250,000 for payroll, take out for taxes, insurance and maintenance, and he claims profits of about $170,000 a year, a figure that couldn't be independently confirmed. I'm no millionaire , he said. So much to do While acknowledging he's probably the only union leader who owns five Zambonis , or ice-smoothing machines, Quirk says his Parks contracts were all bid competitively and City Ice was the highest bidder in each case, which records confirm. It raises questions about how many hats one person can wear , said Rachel Leon , executive director of Common Cause New York. He's a union leader who is also a state employee , who runs a local political campaign - while receiving city contracts for private business interests. Quirk is unapologetic: He's been in business since age 17 when he bought his first Mister Softee ice cream truck , and his investments have put his four daughters through college. Another business venture: He was a co-owner of a restaurant and catering hall in Bay Ridge, now called Thristino's. Although he's no longer involved in the restaurant, his name remains on the state liquor license. I learned at an early age to wear many hats , and I don't think there's anything wrong with it, he said. He has also been careful to get approvals for his ventures outside the court system over a 25-year period , said David Bookstaver, a spokesman for the state Office of Court Administration. There appears to be no conflict with his extracurricular activities , he said. Among them is Quirk's No. 1 political calling - the career of the Brooklyn district attorney. Since 1989 , he has been chief campaign strategist for Hynes, running all four district attorney races, plus his unsuccessful 1998 gubernatorial bid, often from the union's headquarters at 321 Broadway. The court officers union rents a small desk to Friends of Charles Hynes, charging $200 a month, and Quirk says he runs the campaign checkbook from both his office and home. Quirk says he spends just two hours a week on Friends of Hynes matters, five to 10 hours on his private company - and 50 to 70 hours on union business, representing the court officers who serve in the Civil, Criminal and Family Courts. In his day job, he negotiated a sick leave bank in which members are required to donate, or bank, six sick days in their first year on the job. With thousands of days on deposit, court officers are now eligible for five years of full pay in case of serious sickness or injury. It saved my life and the lives of our two autistic kids , said Celeste Cataudella , whose husband, George, stayed on the court payroll from the day he got sick with cancer to the day he died six months later. It was a miracle. Quirk hasn't faced a contested election since the late '70s under bylaws that call for only 20 delegates , not all 1,500 members, to elect the union's president and other officers. Turning nuts and bolts Quirk say he didn't create the system, he inherited it. The King of Courts also plays an outsized role in how the judicial system is managed. He has great sway over such classic management functions as the transfers of employees and the awarding of overtime. And while the Democratic political machines control who becomes an elected judge, he's got a long record of dispensing political counsel, support and endorsements to judges and wanna-be judges - and he's not shy about dressing them down when they cross him. His court officers have been known to paint judicial chambers and haul judges' furniture on weekends. But Quirk also has confronted jurists in their robing rooms over their treatment of his officers - and he's branded some as psychos , wackos and turkeys. In 1995 , he was suspended without pay for 45 days for shouting profanities at then-Manhattan Civil Court Judge Margaret Taylor, who allegedly called two black court officers gorillas. Though he issued a public apology , Quirk said he's got no regrets: I'd do it again tomorrow ... I'm not afraid of any judge. Over a lifetime in the courts we've had our rocky spots , said Chief Administrative Judge Jonathan Lippman. But in the best sense of the words , Dennis is a person you can do business with. Giving According to retired Staten Island Bishop Patrick Ahern , he's also made life a little easier for more than 100 developmentally disabled kids in the borough. Getting court officers to volunteer their time on weekends and rounding up like-minded electricians, carpenters and bricklayers, Quirk help build a Catholic preschool in 1994, high school in 1999 and grammar school in 2001. The only honor he ever wanted was the joy of meeting the needs of these kids , said Ahern. We couldn't have developed the schools without Dennis. Zelig-like , Quirk also has featured in some of the more prominent chapters in the city's recent history: He advised Donald Trump on how to rebuild Central Park's Wollman Memorial Rink after the developer pledged to do, in six months, what the city failed to do in six years. He was threatened by friends of mob boss John Gotti on a Staten Island expressway after he was named as a possible prosecution witness in Gotti's racketeering trial because of his conversations with a court officer the day before he was murdered by the Don's crew. He stashed in the garage of his Staten Island home the car, driven by a court officer, that killed Michael Griffith, who'd been chased onto the Belt Parkway by a Howard Beach, Queens, mob. After holding the death car for three weeks to protect the evidence and the officer, he turned it over to Hynes, who was prosecuting the case. I've had a few escapades , the union boss said. But I'll defend my members to the end of the world.  ",

   "input": "LENOX 2014 If pioneering African-American Shakespearean actor Ira Aldridge (1807-67) hadn 2019t existed, admirers of John Douglas Thompson 2019s award-winning stage portrayals might have been tempted to invent him. The pairing of actor and role could not be more fortuitous. Lolita Chakrabarti 2019s bio-play 201cRed Velvet 201d (alluding to the lure of theaters 2019 lush interiors) provides a perfect showcase for Thompson 2019s formidable gifts. Under Daniela Varon 2019s inspired direction, Thompson brings out resonances in the script that somehow failed to surface during the play 2019s first US production, by a British company, at St. Ann 2019s Warehouse in Brooklyn, N.Y., last year. We first encounter Aldridge during the poignant twilight of his career. On tour in Poland, he 2019s interrogated by an ambitious but inept young woman reporter (Christianna Nelson), occasioning a flashback to what was surely his finest hour. For two nights, in 1833, Aldridge stepped in for an ailing Edmund Kean during a London run of 201cOthello. 201d Not only did he thereby break a color barrier which, unbelievably, persists to this day (the Metropolitan Opera 2019s decision to forgo blackface for an upcoming production recently made headlines), but also Aldridge is credited 2014 at least in this fictionalized rendering 2014 with trying to nudge his fellow practitioners toward a more naturalistic acting style. Varon establishes the norms of the day brilliantly, starting with a stylized company salute (en d 00e9shabille) and continuing with balletic scene changes set to piano adagios. These interludes, replacing the usual rushed, apologetic shuffle, suggest an era of greater leisure and formality. And yes, the company, once assembled, proves hilariously grandiose in both word and gesture 2014 especially young Charles Kean (Ben Chase), who naturally assumes that, in his famous father 2019s absence, he 2019ll be promoted to the title role. Every good drama needs a powerful villain, and Chase 2019s Charles 2014 the embodiment of unbridled racist animus, as well as a big, spoiled baby 2014 ably shoulders the task. One premise of the play is that Aldridge 2019s more realistic, less robotically physicalized portrayal proved too intense for the times: audiences apparently loved him (attendance spiked), but the critics were merciless. Their objections 2014 relayed verbatim 2014 constitute a time capsule of odious stereotype. These passages are shocking to hear, and it 2019s tempting to relegate such slurs to the distant past 2014 yet one has only to think back to New York theater critic John Simon 2019s racist commentary from the 1970s, when color-blind casting was just coming to the fore. In Chakrabarti 2019s retelling, another touchpoint arousing public censure in London (the production shut down after only two performances) was Aldridge 2019s apparent success in getting his Desdemona 2014 here, the luminous Kelley Curran 2014 to appear more responsive. One problem with the British cast (which featured a rather mature Desdemona 2014 true to the standards of the day, but distracting) is that they never fully shed their stiffness. In Curran 2019s sensitive rendition, a staid, formulaic actress gradually softens, professionally and personally. The upshot is that Desdemona 2019s reaction to the Moor 2019s murderous embrace ends up so rapturous, slanderous insinuations are certain to ensue. Even under Varon 2019s enlivening hand, the play starts on a bumpy note: Why allot so much stage time to the Polish reporter 2019s interrogation, except to stuff it with clumsy exposition? But there 2019s another reason, revealed only when the framing device is picked up again at play 2019s end. Prepare to discover your heart lurching into your throat. Thompson, having masterfully portrayed a young man at the height of his furious, insistent powers, retains an ember of that passion as an old, not entirely defeated trouper still dedicated to his craft, whatever the cost. Lights, Matthew Miller. Costumes, Moria Sine Clinton. Produced by Shakespeare & Co. At: Tina Packer Playhouse, Lenox, through Sept 13.  ",

Meantime, at least one operator of day care centers in Silicon Valley is urging parents to make sure their children's vaccines are up to date. LinkedIn said it learned on February 10 that one of its employees had been diagnosed, and immediately notified all of its 7,000 employees worldwide. But the unidentified employee had already made multiple trips on Bay Area Rapid Transit between February 4th and 6th, and had eaten in a San Francisco restaurant on the 4th. We are working very closely with the San Francisco Department of Public Health , and following their recommended protocol for managing this situation, LinkedIn spokesman Hani Durzi said in a statement. The health and well-being of our employees is our absolute top priority , and we will take whatever steps are advised to ensure their safety and the safety of the general public. The large concentration of young parents working at the region's technology firms has brought the measles outbreak into focus. Wired Magazine , citing California Department of Health data, reported this week that several on-site day care facilities at technology firms have vaccination rates too low to provide the so-called herd immunity that is supposed to keep the disease from spreading. Experts generally say if 92 percent of the community is vaccinated , it should be enough to protect the general population, though some caution the figure should be more than 95 percent. But Wired found rates as low as 59 percent at a Cisco Systems facility in San Jose, and 68 percent at a Google facility in Mountain View. CNBC verified the figures in the state database. Both companies say the numbers represent a snapshot of data, and may not reflect the most recent immunization history reported by parents. Google notes that in 2013-14, the facility in question had an 81 percent immunization rate. And Cisco says it continually works with its employees and daycare contractors to make certain records are up to date. Read MoreSome African nations better vaccinated than the US  ",

The analyst from the French bank highlighted that the U.K. government - currently led by the Conservative Party - has not been able to deliver on its promises to reduce the country's spending levels, leaving grotesquely wide deficits and external imbalances. Effectively , the Conservatives have kicked the can into the next parliament, Edwards added, with the public sector deficit and current account deficit - the measurement of the country's trade - both exceeding 5 percent of the U.K.'s GDP (gross domestic product). That is a poor legacy indeed , he said. What is so shocking is how little progress has been made since the 2008 Great Recession. Going into the general election it is difficult to separate fact from fiction as both main parties trade insults and make claim and counterclaim. Edwards' comments echo those of Carl Weinberg , chief economist at High Frequency Economics, who told CNBC in January that sterling risked a very big move of very dramatic proportions as a result of this deficit. The pound has slipped over 5 percent against the greenback over the year to date as the general election looms.

We keep paying for the bank 2019s messes. We pay for the government hearings and investigations, the losses in our retirement accounts, the negative impact on the economy, and in many other ways. J.P. Morgan JPM CEO Jamie Dimon testified before the Senate Banking Committee this morning. But in all the hullabaloo and consternation about the bank 2019s oversized bets, only a minute or two was spent on incentives. Sure, J.P. Morgan 2019s proxy has something to say about pay and risk. The company is required to address such things now. And what it says is that 201cregardless of the motivation, 201d the bank 2019s 201crisk discipline 201d and 201cfrequent risk reporting 201d has 201cexcessive risk-taking 201d under control. Well, that didn 2019t work so well at Fortune 2019s most admired megabank and No. 22 most admired company in the world. Despite what Dimon said this morning, it 2019s important to remember this is not an isolated mistake. Bloomberg reported last week that a court appointed monitor is seeking consumer input related to ongoing foreclosure abuses. And the senators at the hearing asked for help for constituents that are being told their paperwork is missing. To his credit, Dimon said the bank would look into the paperwork issues. But poor oversight is a management and governance deficiency. The billions of dollars in trading losses is merely the most recent example of poor risk oversight at the largest banks On May 10, J.P. Morgan disclosed its immense trading losses. But on April 6, a hedge fund manager told the Financial Times: 201cThe thing I 2019d be questioning, though, is why JPMorgan has such a big directional position when banks aren 2019t supposed to be prop trading any more. 201d And Bloomberg reported on April 9 that 201cfour hedge-fund managers and dealers say the trades are big enough to move indexes and resemble proprietary bets, or wagers made with the bank 2019s own money. 201d If outsiders understood the size of the gambles back then, where were the bank 2019s senior managers and its board? Why on April 13 did they not understand the magnitude, as Dimon testified this morning was the case? MORE: Dimon hearing raises questions about risk models When I speak with board directors, risk managers, and consultants who work with some of the largest banks, they agree that there is still a lot of work to do when it comes to risk oversight. And if Congress wanted to get the real picture, that 2019s who they 2019d be talking to 2014 along with other observers who know the score. Not that everyone would be forthcoming, but if Congress asked the right questions, they would get the facts about the bailed out banks soon enough. Exec pay days, for all the wrong reasons But let 2019s focus instead on motive and the all too obvious fact: incentives matter. If you pay for the wrong reasons in the wrong form, you 2019ll get the risky behaviors you encourage. We shouldn 2019t be surprised. Jamie Dimon became CEO of J.P. Morgan on January 1, 2006. The latest J.P. Morgan proxy shows that Jamie Dimon holds shares (and equivalents) worth over $200 million based on the company 2019s closing price June 8. If the stock price rose to where it was just five years ago, his net worth would jump by $75 million. A similar pop would net Ina Drew, former chief investment officer at the bank, over $23 million, if you include her deferred compensation and unvested shares. Drew oversaw the unit responsible for the large losses and reported directly to Dimon according to the testimony this morning. As in years past, the board gave Dimon and Drew 2019s pay primarily in stock and options-based awards. Those items alone totaled $17 million and $8.5 million in 2011, respectively. So what really drives their behavior? And what message is the board sending when they pay their executives this way? This kind of high pay is exactly what a December New York Fed staff report warned could encourage risky CEO behavior and create economic distress. (Ironically, Dimon sits on the NY Fed 2019s board, although a petition for his removal has garnered over 36,000 signatures.) In contrast, sound compensation guidance from the regulators recommends risk-based measures, which put a company 2019s and its employees 2019 performance in the context of the quantity and quality of the risk that 2019s taken on. Though banks claim to use risk-based measures, stock price is still the biggest determining factor in top bank executives 2019 actual rewards. But goosing a company 2019s stock price and taking rational risks are not exactly close companions. Former CEO Dick Fuld at Lehman Brothers was the poster child for this issue. MORE: 3 ways to take control of your retirement Even the measures cited in the proxy for rewarding Dimon and Drew are not risk-based. While a spokesperson for Citi c (which received a no vote on pay this year) wrote in an email that 201cCiti has continued to enhance the ability of the firm to reduce risks through its compensation programs, 201d J. P. Morgan, Goldman GS , Bank of America bac , and Morgan Stanley ms declined to discuss their pay practices for this article. No wonder. An October 2011 report by the Federal Reserve confirms that the use of risk-based measures at the large banks is 201cuneven 201d and every bank has more work to do. 201cSubstantial work remains to be done to achieve consistency and effectiveness 2026 in providing balanced risk-taking incentives, 201d the report states. Put simply, bank boards need a kick in the pants. The FDIC put out an advanced notice over two years ago asking for comments on proposing a rule that would charge banks more for depository insurance if their pay programs were risky. Such a measure could have been a real impetus to fix pay. But, 201cto date, there has been no follow-up to the advance notice of proposed rulemaking, 201d an FDIC spokesperson recently emailed me. And Martin Gruenberg, acting chair of the FDIC, did not address pay or such a proposed rule in his prepared testimony before the Senate last week. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is getting beat up these days. They had staff in London where the J.P. Morgan traders were located. An OCC spokesperson explained to me by email that while their staffers review trading data daily or weekly, 201ceven a strong risk management culture could have surprises or breaks, but they should not be of significant magnitude relative to the banks business. 201d Regarding pay, 201cthe [sound compensation] guidance stands as what the examiners are using to supervise banks. 201d Last week, in his remarks before the banking committee, OCC head Thomas Curry mentioned 201cthe need to ensure that incentive compensation structures balance risk and financial rewards and are compatible with effective controls and risk management. 201d Daniel Tarullo testified on behalf of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. But his prepared remarks did not mention compensation. This, despite the fact that the Fed has oversight responsibility for top executives 2019 pay. The Fed 2019s October 2011 report outlines that bank pay 201cshould achieve substantial conformance with the interagency guidance by the end of 2011 (affecting the award of incentive compensation awards for the 2011 performance year), and should fully conform thereafter. 201d Neither the OCC nor Federal Reserve would comment, however, on their examinations and assessments. MORE: David Herro: Why I 2019m betting big on Europe The silence, especially from the Fed, is deafening, particularly since the banks 2019 compensation fixes seem to have been done for only some managers rather than the top executives. But pay programs for top executives matter most because their motives will influence their instructions and other managers 2019 actions. (While the reverse is not necessarily true.)

Corn firmed as a weekly U.S. Department of Agriculture report showed a slight decline in the crop's condition, while wheat futures declined on weak demand and plentiful global supplies. Overall, price movements were restrained as grain markets awaited more indications on corn and soybean yields from this week's Pro Farmer Midwest crop tour that started on Monday. Chicago Board of Trade November soybeans fell 13-3 4 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $9.03-1 4 a bushel by 10:50 a.m. CDT (1550 GMT) after earlier coming within a penny of a two-month low. Overall ratings for U.S. soybean crops were unchanged on the week with 63 percent considered good or excellent, the USDA said on Monday. Weather forecasts for the United States are predicting widespread rain in the coming week, which should help soy crops in dry parts of the Midwest. August is when you make the beans. Some of the areas were in need of some rain , even the good areas, and we are getting it, said Don Roose , president of U.S. Commodities. Market sentiment was also dented by a sharp drop in Chinese share prices, stoking concerns about a slowing economy in the world's top commodities importer and No. 1 soy buyer. CBOT December corn rose 2-1 2 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $3.77 a bushel, drawing support from a fall in the USDA's good-to-excellent crop rating to 69 percent, down one point from the previous week. Long corn short soybean spreading added support. Crop scouts on the first day of the Pro Farmer Midwest crop tour found below-average yield potential in Ohio on Monday and strong prospects in South Dakota. The four-day tour will release its findings for Indiana and Nebraska on Tuesday. Early field reports indicate surprisingly strong corn and soybean yield potential in central and north-central Indiana. CBOT September soft red winter wheat fell 4-3 4 cents, or 1 percent, to $4.95-3 4 a bushel. September hard red winter wheat shed 6-1 4 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $4.76 a bushel.

   "input": "While the market is anxiously awaiting Thursday's comments from Fed Chair Janet Yellen and a decision on a potential hike in interest rates, Main Street is quietly going about its business. The Fed hasn't raised rates from their historically low, near-zero level for nine years, and in that time American small businesses have gone through their ups and downs, chiefly the Great Recession. But what impacts their decisions to borrow, spend and expand much more than rates alone are levels of optimism, available capital and sales outlook, among other factors. Right now, Ed Menapace and Bill Curtis, owners of The Farmhouse Store in Westfield, New Jersey, say they're paying more attention to what they can control 2014their inventories and adapting to changes in consumer spending. We can shift very quickly and change our product lines , if for example we find customers spending 5 percent less, Menapace said. We don't worry about things we can't control. Data compiled for CNBC in May by Manta , a small-business industry researcher, found a similar reaction with 39 percent of 1,000 small-business owners, saying a rate hike wouldn't impact their business at all. In addition, about 64 percent of small-business owners said a rate hike wouldn't pressure them to secure loans for their business quickly. A potential rate hike comes at a time when smaller companies are feeling decidedly optimistic, by a variety of indicators. The National Federation of Independent Business' optimism index has been holding steady, reading 95.9 in its September report, but still below the average of 98. The report showed a 0.5 percent gain, despite the ups and downs of the stock market in recent weeks, although it may have been too late to register on the index. But the conservative lobbying group does note that uncertainty regarding government policy is always a top concern, and to its membership the Fed's will-they-or-won't-they dance only elevates that issue. But perhaps another reason smaller companies aren't torn up over a potential increase 2014capital is readily available for those who need it, says Gene Marks, who runs The Marks Group in Philadelphia, providing tech and financial services to some 600 small-and medium-sized businesses in the Mid-Atlantic region. Interest rates are still at historical lows 2014even if you're borrowing at a point or two higher of a rate , Marks said. There are plenty of business owners that are borrowing at competitive rates from their banks 2026 but there are a significant number that go to online providers at higher rates because that's their only option , he said , adding a small increase won't have a huge impact.

This week , both New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley and Atlanta Fed's Dennis Lockhart expressed concern about the strength of the dollar. Lockhart in particular played down the idea that dollar gains were a vote of confidence in the U.S. recovery, saying they could equally be a vote of low confidence about other countries. He stated in a speech in Jackson, Mississippi this Thursday that capital goods orders could get hit by the strength of the dollar, and exports generally would suffer. He added that it would be better to raise rates too late, rather than too early and be forced to reverse course. Winners: Central banks down under The continuing strength pf the dollar will help central bankers outside the U.S. who are worried their own currencies are uncompetitively high. As the dollar appreciates, these currencies decline. Both the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand have attempted to talk down their currencies in recent months. This Thursday, New Zealand Governor Graeme Wheeler repeated his warning that the kiwi exchange rate 2014which hit a three-year peak against the dollar in July 2014was unsustainable and unjustified.

Eight of the 10 S&P 500 sectors were higher, led by gains in the consumer discretionary index, up 0.6 percent. Shares of homebuilders were up, bouncing back from Thursday's decline after JP Morgan raised price targets on PulteGroup , up 1.9 percent, and Meritage Homes, up 2.5 percent. Oil prices fell after the Goldman forecast, which cited oversupply and concerns over China's economy. Goldman said crude oil could fall as low as $20 a barrel. ConocoPhillips, down 2.6 percent at $47.17, was the biggest drag on the S&P 500. Economic data clouded the outlook for interest rates ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting next week. U.S. consumer sentiment dropped to its lowest level in a year in early September, while unchanged producer prices for August pointed to moderate economic growth and tame inflation. The Fed has said it will raise rates when it sees a sustained economic recovery, especially in the job market. The market overall seems to be shrugging off the decline in oil prices and disappointments from a number of retailers in recent days , said Michael James , managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. He said investors could be positioning ahead of the weekend and more economic data from China. At 3:14 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average rose 76.57 points, or 0.47 percent, to 16,406.97, the S&P 500 gained 4.39 points, or 0.22 percent, to 1,956.68 and the Nasdaq Composite added 15.55 points, or 0.32 percent, to 4,811.80.

But Fox's adjusted profit beat Wall Street expectations and the company said it would buy back $5 billion Class A shares over the next 12 months. Fox's shares were down marginally in after-hours trading on Wednesday. Adjusted revenue, which excluded the sale of the company's direct broadcast satellite television businesses, fell to $6.21 billion. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $6.41 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I B E S. Revenue in Fox's film studio business fell by a third to $1.91 billion as no major titles released in the quarter. The year-ago quarter was driven mainly by the success of X-Men: Days of Future Past and the animation film Rio 2. The company in the next few months is slated to release movies such as Fantastic Four and sci-fi sequel Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials. Fox recorded the lowest ratings among the Big Four broadcasting networks in the 2014-2015 television season , according to Nielsen data. This was reflected in the 4.3 percent decline in the company's television revenue in the fourth quarter. Revenue in its cable network programming business rose 6.6 percent to $3.57 billion, boosted by coverage of NASCAR and ICC Cricket World Cup sporting events. The business accounts for more than half the company's total revenue. Domestic advertising sales rose 4 percent, helped by double-digit growth in its sports channels including Star Sports and Fox Sports 1. Excluding items, the company earned 39 cents per share in the fourth quarter ended June 30, beating the average analyst estimate of 37 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I B E S.

Learning to adjust the air-conditioning in their exhibits could also be possible one day for the zoo's orang-utans, thanks to a world-first research project. Researchers for the first time on Tuesday introduced a human participant to work alongside the orang-utans playing interactive games. The games use interactive motion-sensing technology Microsoft Kinect - commonly used with Xbox - with images projected onto the orang-utans' exhibit and a motion-sensing camera. The University of Melbourne, Microsoft and Zoo Victoria project aims to give the orang-utans at Melbourne Zoo greater choice and control over how and when they interact with their surroundings. What I'm really excited about is that we're not giving them rewards for interacting with this technology - they are doing it because they want to , University of Melbourne researcher Marcus Carter told AAP on Tuesday. The zoo hopes to let visitors join in the fun and eventually allow the apes more control over their exhibit. Dr Carter said the technology opened possibilities beyond just enrichment games. The challenge comes in how do you design for an orang-utan , rather than what can you do with the technology, he said. Dr Carter said Malu , the 12-year-old Sumatran orang-utan famous for escaping the exhibit briefly last July, has shown off his problem-solving ability. He has understood , in each of the challenges we've been giving him, how to interact, he said.

   "input": "A stock slump last year squeezed trucking executive Jerry Moyes, who had borrowed heavily against his shares in the company he founded. The chief executive of Swift Transportation Co. , one of the largest trucking firms in the U.S., not only faced demands for more loan collateral but ran up against company limits on the extent of his borrowing. Three times, Swift 2019s board stepped in to give the CEO more time to deal with his margin loans. Mr. Moyes also got some potential relief via a stronger share price as the board approved a stock buyback plan, Swift 2019s first since going public six years ago. Now Mr. Moyes is calling for an even larger buyback, in one of a chain of events at the trucking firm that shows the complications a board can face as it grapples with how much to let top executives borrow against their stakes in a company. Mr. Moyes has pledged more than $600 million of his holdings in Swift 2014a quarter of the outstanding shares 2014as collateral for loans or in complex loan-like contracts, according to securities filings. The trucking company 2019s stock tumbled 52% in 2015. The fall triggered margin calls 2014demands to make up shortfalls in the value of collateral 2014which Mr. Moyes sometimes dealt with by pledging more Swift shares. His use of his Swift stock as margin-loan collateral has exceeded limits set by the board, regulatory filings show. As those limits gradually kicked in, directors gave Mr. Moyes additional time to meet them, which could be done by moves such as reducing his personal debts or using collateral other than Swift shares. In November and January, Swift spent $100 million on share repurchases. Then on Tuesday, a day after Swift disclosed earnings, Mr. Moyes said he wanted the company to spend $200 million more buying back shares. Swift 2019s stock surged 22%. At current prices, a buyback of that size would retire about 9% of the stock, supporting its price and easing pressure on Mr. Moyes 2019s margin loans. Despite Tuesday 2019s price jump, Swift 2019s stock remains down by 40% from a year ago. Swift officials say the buyback plan is unrelated to Mr. Moyes 2019s stock pledges. Swift isn 2019t the only company whose executives have struggled with loans against their shares after price drops cut their collateral 2019s value. During the late-2008 market meltdown, Sumner Redstone, executive chairman of Viacom Inc. and CBS Corp. , sold 20% of his stake in the companies to satisfy debts. Aubrey McClendon, founder and former CEO of Chesapeake Energy Corp., was forced to unload 94% of his stake. Last year, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. CEO J. Michael Pearson had to sell about $100 million of his shares in the company as its once-soaring shares slumped. Though corporations may permit executives and directors to borrow against company shares they own, many limit or ban the practice. Such borrowing is unpopular among some institutional investors, who say it can undermine the long-term incentive of stock ownership by generating quick cash, and can insulate executives from poor company performance. Also, if the stock price falls, holders of pledged shares could be forced to sell rapidly, hurting the price even more. Institutional Shareholder Services, the proxy-advisory firm, has objected to the Swift board 2019s willingness to let top executives pledge shares they own. 201cThe directors, in a certain sense, they do have an obligation to implement an unwinding strategy that is not going to be detrimental to shareholders, 201d said Carol Bowie, ISS 2019s head of Americas research. 201cOn the other hand, this has been going on for a while, and investors do have a legitimate question here about what took them so long. 201d Mr. Moyes, who owns a controlling stake in the company he founded 50 years ago, declined to comment. Swift said the CEO has been working under the board 2019s leadership to reduce his shares pledged for margin loans. 201cIn bringing about this reduction, the Board and Mr. Moyes are mindful of the need to ensure that any reduction occur in an orderly fashion, 201d a written company statement said. Richard Dozer, Swift 2019s chairman, added that 201cthe $100 million share repurchase plan that we, as a Board of Directors, authorized in September of 2015 had absolutely nothing to do with Mr. Moyes stock pledging, or margin calls. 201d A company spokesman said several large shareholders had urged Swift last summer to consider share repurchases. Swift 2019s board is unusually small, just six members. To analysts of corporate governance, board size matters: While too-large boards can be unwieldy, too-small boards can turn into echo chambers and foster an eagerness among directors to get along in the face of tough decisions. The Phoenix-based company has just four independent directors, as defined by New York Stock Exchange rules, Swift 2019s securities filings say. And one of those deemed independent, Mr. Dozer, spent years helping run a business that was partly owned by Mr. Moyes, the Arizona Diamondbacks. Mr. Dozer was the baseball team 2019s president from 1995 until 2006, and Mr. Moyes was a minority owner from 1996 until last year. Mr. Dozer said the board has been 201cworking in concert to reduce the number of shares Jerry has pledged on margin loans. 201d Swift 2019s regulatory filings 201cadequately explain the transactions and timelines, 201d he said. Another independent director, Glenn Brown, said, 201cAll the decisions that the board makes are in the best interests of the shareholders. 201d The son of a trucker, Mr. Moyes, 71 years old, is a pioneer of the modern trucking business. He built Swift from a single truck in Phoenix into a coast-to-coast giant with 18,000 trucks and $4 billion in annual revenue. Mr. Moyes resigned as CEO in 2005 after a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission of civil insider-trading allegations, in which he didn 2019t admit any wrongdoing. Two years later, he took Swift private in a $2.6 billion leveraged buyout. Mr. Moyes has often used his stake in Swift 2014which he took public again in 2010 2014to help fund other pursuits, analysts say. 201cJerry 2019s always got a bunch of money collateralized, 201d said Art Hatfield, an analyst at brokerage firm Raymond James. 201cEver since he 2019s been involved with the company, he 2019s pledged his stock. He 2019s got so many different business interests going on that he 2019s always used Swift stocks as collateral against loans to his other ventures. 201d In addition to Swift and the Diamondbacks, Mr. Moyes 2019s ventures in the Phoenix area have included a charter airline, a steel fabricator and a marina that offers boat tours of Lake Powell. He was a minority owner of the Phoenix Suns basketball team and was majority owner of the NHL 2019s Phoenix Coyotes, in a group that included hockey great Wayne Gretzky, before the team filed for bankruptcy and was sold back to the league in 2009. Mr. Moyes and his family owned 60.3 million Swift shares as of Oct. 31 and had pledged at least 37 million of them either as margin-loan collateral or in loan-like arrangements, according to regulatory filings. When Swift went public for the second time, it had a policy barring directors and senior officers from pledging more than 20% of their family holdings in Swift stock for margin loans. In 2013, the board revised the limits, lowering the cap to 15% as of July 2014 and to 10% as of July 2015. In June 2015, Mr. Moyes told Swift 2019s chairman he was trying to reduce the amount of his pledged shares to meet the 10% cap but needed until November 201cto do so in an orderly fashion, 201d according to an SEC filing. The board amended its rules so the 10% limit wouldn 2019t take effect until Dec. 1, 2015. Overcapacity and weak demand have squeezed trucking companies over the past year. In September, Swift warned it would miss its earnings targets for 2015 and announced its first stock-buyback plan since it went public for the second time in 2010. Swift said shortly afterward it would halt the expansion of its truck fleet. In October, Mr. Moyes told the board he hadn 2019t reduced his borrowings as promised. Owing to a drop in the stock price, he had pledged additional shares to meet margin calls, according to an SEC filing. More than 15% of his holdings were now pledged, he said, and he needed more time to comply with the board 2019s limits. Independent directors met and sanctioned Mr. Moyes, saying he would forfeit two months of salary and his 2015 bonus. They asked him to reduce the portion of his shares pledged as collateral to 15% or less by Nov. 4, according to an SEC filing. As for the 10% limit, the board delayed imposing that for another year 2014until the end of 2016 2014 201cso that the margin positions could be reduced in an orderly fashion, 201d according to the filing. On Christmas Eve, Swift said that 201cas a result of recent volatility 201d in the stock, Mr. Moyes had once again increased the amount of his Swift stock pledged on margin loans, exceeding the 15% limit. The board waived the 15% restriction, giving him until the end of 2016 to reduce his position, according to SEC filings. According to SEC filings, Mr. Moyes has pledged some eight million shares of Swift as collateral for margin loans, as well as more than 29 million shares in complex transactions typically called 201cvariable prepaid forward contracts 201d with Citigroup Inc. These loan-like agreements gave the CEO cash upfront in exchange for his pledge to deliver some of his shares or cash in the future. For example, on Oct. 30, Mr. Moyes pledged 3.3 million shares to Citigroup and received $48.3 million in cash. Citigroup declined to comment. The CEO 2019s total shares pledged either on margin loans or in the Citigroup contracts amount to more than 60% of his family 2019s Swift holdings. But Swift 2019s board counts only shares used for margin loans against its pledging limits for executives. After reporting quarterly results this week, Mr. Moyes on Tuesday called for a $200 million stock buyback and said he would seek board approval in February. 201cI believe that the share repurchase at these ridiculous low prices can make a lot of sense, 201d he told investors on a conference call. He said that the first share buyback had added four cents to per-share annual earnings and that a second, larger one would add 8 to 10 cents a share. The company said in a written statement that its 201cbusiness performance continues to be strong as evidenced by the seven-percent increase in revenue and eight-percent increase in adjusted earnings per share in 2015. 201d The new buyback proposal puts Swift out of step with a consolidation trend in the trucking industry, which has seen many of the largest companies seek to build revenue by acquiring competitors. In the call with analysts, Mr. Moyes said Swift had a chance in the past year to acquire another company for about $500 million but concluded that a share buyback would raise earnings more than an acquisition, with less risk. Some analysts agree, saying repurchasing shares was a better use of Swift 2019s capital than taking a risk with an acquisition. 201cPeople agree with the move regardless of Moyes 2019s financial situation, 201d said Mr. Hatfield of Raymond James. Other investors, among them the Teamsters, said the limits put in place by the company don 2019t go far enough because they don 2019t apply to the arrangements with Citigroup. Mr. Moyes is 201cusing Swift as his personal bank, 201d said Carin Zelenko, director of the capital-strategies department for the Teamsters union, which holds a stake in Swift. The board 2019s limit on the pledging of shares 201cwas only addressing part of the problem, and now we see they can 2019t even hold him to that, 201d she said. Swift said Mr. Moyes 2019s arrangements with Citigroup aren 2019t margin loans, and the company 2019s treatment of them is consistent with policies in place since Swift 2019s IPO in 2010. 2014Paul Page contributed to this article.

   "input": "TOKYO 2014Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's pro-growth policy is losing momentum as a higher tax burden keeps consumers' wallets closed, an economic adviser to Mr. Abe said on Monday, warning that it would be a mistake to raise the sales tax again next year, as is currently planned. The effects of Abenomics are weakening compared with last year , Etsuro Honda said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal , in which he also said the Bank of Japan would need to take more action to achieve its inflation goal if the current situation continues. The government's move to raise the national sales-tax rate to 8% from 5% on April 1 has cut consumers' real purchasing power, dealing a blow to domestic demand, an outcome the government shouldn't repeat next year, he said. Abenomics and the sales-tax increase are policies facing in opposite directions. If you step on the gas and hit the brakes at the same time , you know what will happen? The car will go into a spin. Proponents of the tax increase , including Finance Minister Taro Aso, say borrowing costs would jump, choking off economic growth, should a government saddled with huge public debt signals that it is easing up on efforts to overhaul its finances. Opponents argue that raising the tax in a hurry would cut tax revenue and make fiscal overhauls more difficult, by derailing an economic recovery sparked by Abenomics. Mr. Honda expressed displeasure at last week's comment by BOJ Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda suggesting the central-bank chief wants the government to follow through with a plan to lift the consumption tax to 10% in October next year. The law stipulates that the government should steer tax policy in that direction as long as the economy is on an upturn. I want the governor of the Bank of Japan to focus exclusively on monetary policy , Mr. Honda said. What the government should do with the consumption-tax rate , and when, is a matter to be decided by the government, and I want him to leave that job to the government. Mr. Honda , a longtime friend of Mr. Abe's and one of the architects of the Abenomics policy mix of monetary easing, fiscal stimulus and structural overhauls, said the best option would be for the government to postpone the two-percentage-point increase by 1 00bd years. That would give the economy time to realize higher wage increases, something essential to make sustainable economic growth take hold, he said. Mr. Honda's remarks underline a heightening sense of caution among those who are close to Mr. Abe. Koichi Hamada, a Yale University professor emeritus and another adviser to the prime minister, suggested in an interview with The Wall Street Journal in August that he wants the government to go more slowly in raising the tax rate. The launch of Abenomics after Mr. Abe took office in late 2012 initially raised high hopes for the Japanese economy, driving Tokyo stock markets up nearly 60% in 2013. But optimism toward his policies has recently faded as evidence emerged that an additional annual sales-tax burden of some $80 billion took a greater toll on the economy than had generally been expected. Abenomics' primary goal to end over a decade of deflation by spurring 2% price growth through monetary easing by the BOJ is coming under stronger scrutiny. Data released on Monday showed that the economy contracted an annualized 7.1% in the quarter through June, worse than the initial reading. Everything buckled 2014consumption , capital spending, housing investment and infrastructure. This is very bad, Mr. Honda said. A quick summer rebound in growth hoped for by officials has yet to materialize , with other data signaling continued stagnation in consumption in July and August. Mr. Honda rejected the view of many government and BOJ officials that weakening consumption is largely because of households taking a rest following a buying binge ahead of the tax change, and partly because of rainy summer weather. The negative income effects are here to stay permanently , Mr. Honda said. Unless you do something to overcome them , you can't get over the sales-tax impact. While there is no need for the central bank to act immediately , looking objectively at the current circumstances , I see a high possibility of macroeconomic conditions eventually reaching a point where the BOJ will have to ramp up easing measures , he said. In contrast, fiscal policy is hard to mobilize because a shortage of construction workers makes expanding infrastructure spending difficult, he said. The only viable option left for the government to produce a quick impact is simple cash handouts , but it would be challenging to justify the move because that could raise fundamental questions over why we are raising taxes in the first place , he said. While Messrs. Honda and Kuroda are sharply at odds on tax policy , both play down concerns that a weaker yen against the dollar will hurt Japan's economy by lifting the cost of living for Japanese. Even if the yen weakens a little more , that will be no problem at all for the economy , given its effect of boosting the value of what Japan earns through exports and foreign investment in yen terms, Mr. Honda said, adding that a further weakening wouldn't strike him as strange. Still, Mr. Honda said a dollar above 00a5120 would be too high. Write to Takashi Nakamichi at takashi.nakamichi@wsj.com  ",

The home usually serves as the Fire Chief's residence but the new planning director, John Rahim, is the current occupant. Sources say Rahim and his boyfriend, Lance Corey Farber, got into a fight and Farber lit the bed on fire Friday night. Farber fled but was later arrested in another county. Photo by Paul Chinn San Francisco Chronicle No one answered the door to the city's historic Dennis T. Sullivan Memorial Home when reporters knocked on the door in San Francisco, Calif., on Saturday, Feb. 23, 2008. The home usually serves as the Fire Landmark fire chief's residence is vandalized San Francisco's historic fire chief's residence was trashed Friday night in what authorities said Saturday was a case of suspected arson and vandalism linked to the boyfriend of the city's new Planning Department chief, who is temporarily living in the home. Planning Department Director John Rahaim, who just started the job last month after being appointed by Mayor Gavin Newsom, was not home at the time of the incident, police said. About 30 firefighters and a cadre of high-ranking city officials, including the police and fire chiefs and Board of Supervisors President Aaron Peskin, rushed to the Bush Street landmark to find a bizarre scene that included a bed burning inside the home, overturned furniture, and a can of crushed tomatoes smeared on the floors and walls, sources familiar with the investigation said. Rahaim's boyfriend, Lance Farber,47, fled the scene after setting a mattress on fire at about 8:50 p.m. and causing $10,000 worth of vandalism damage, police said. He was arrested in San Mateo County about an hour later on suspicion of driving under the influence. He was booked in the San Francisco County Jail Friday night on one count of arson of an inhabited dwelling and one count of felony vandalism, police said. This is a difficult time for John Rahaim , and the mayor is fully supportive of him, Newsom's spokesman Nathan Ballard said Saturday. There's broad consensus that John Rahaim is doing a good job as planning director , and this incident has nothing to do with his on-the-job performance. It's a personal matter. The Dennis T. Sullivan Memorial Fire Chief's Home , built in 1923, is an official San Francisco landmark. Fire Chief Joanne Hayes-White does not live in the home at 870 Bush St., and the three-story dwelling is occasionally used for high-ranking city employees who have relocated to the city and are in need of transitional housing. Hayes-White said the agreement to have Rahaim live in the house was negotiated by the mayor's office and using the home as temporary housing for city officials is not something she wants to see continued. The scene was in disarray. It was very disturbing , Hayes-White said. Rahaim ,52, and Farber recently moved into the home after moving from Seattle, where Rahaim ran that city's planning department, city officials speaking on the condition of anonymity said. Rahaim was not home Friday when he received a telephone call from Farber, who threatened to set fire to the fire chief's residence, Police Sgt. Steve Mannina said. He said , 'I'm going to burn the house, ' Mannina said. Rahaim immediately called 911 , and authorities arrived to find the garage door open, the home vandalized and a small mattress fire burning, Mannina said. The inside of the home looked like there was a huge frat party , said sources familiar with the investigation , who asked to be unnamed because of the sensitive nature of the case. Tables were overturned, antique furniture that was part of the historic residence was broken, pictures were knocked off the wall, and crushed tomatoes were smeared on the rugs and walls, sources said. Though the fire was limited to a mattress, box spring and comforter inside an upstairs bedroom, the whole home reeked of smoke, sources said. Although neighbors said firefighters dragged the mattress outside Friday, by Saturday afternoon the only signs that a fire had occurred were charred white feathers billowing in the doorway of the old brick-front home. The home was designed to look like a firehouse, and San Francisco was the first city in the country to build a separate residence for its fire chief, according to the San Francisco Fire Department Museum Web site. A bronze plaque outside the home honors Fire Chief Engineer Dennis Sullivan, who was killed in the 1906 earthquake. It was packed out here with firefighters , said 59-year-old Daisy McArthur , who lives across the street residence. McArthur was standing outside the home when Rahaim arrived on the scene Friday evening, about 25 minutes after firefighters showed up. He was distraught , she said. Shocked. Mannina said police broadcast information about Farber having allegedly fled the scene of the fire. San Mateo County sheriff's deputies pulled Farber over on Millbrae Avenue near Highway 101 on suspicion of driving under the influence , he said. After they arrested him , they put two and two together that he was wanted on the other crime, Mannina said. Ballard said Rahaim obtained a restraining order against Farber after the Friday evening incident.  ",

   "input": "Anyone who works for a major news website or publisher knows that social referrals 2014that is, links that are shared on social networks such as Facebook and Twitter 2014have become a crucial source of incoming traffic, and have been vying with search as a source of new readers for some time. Now, according to new numbers from the traffic-analytics service Parse.ly, Facebook is no longer just vying with Google but has overtaken it by a significant amount. Parse.ly 2019s chief technical officer Andrew Montalenti said in an interview with Fortune that the company 2019s latest estimates show that social-media sources (of which Facebook FB is by far the largest) accounted for about 43% of the traffic to the Parse.ly network of media sites, while Google accounted for just 38%. The company 2019s clients include more than 400 major news and media outlets, including traditional publishers such as Wired, The Atlantic, Reuters and The Daily Telegraph, as well as a large group of digital-only outlets such as Mashable, The Next Web, and Business Insider. Collectively, the network accounts for about 6 billion pageviews and more than one billion unique visitors per month. This isn 2019t the first time that Facebook has edged past Google in the traffic-referral race, Montalenti said. The social network (which is No. 10 on Fortune 2019s 2015 Fastest Growing Companies list) took the top spot by a small amount last October, but this month 2019s lead is far more dramatic 2014and the Parse.ly CTO said that from the company 2019s data, it 2019s clear that search has hit a kind of plateau and isn 2019t really growing any more as a referral source for media. Meanwhile, Facebook 2019s influence has 201cshown it 2019s on a continued growth trajectory. 201d That trajectory has been fairly dramatic: According to Parse.ly, as recently as January of last year, Facebook accounted for just 20% of all the traffic from documented sources to the company 2019s network of media sites, and now it is more than double that. Montalenti said this doesn 2019t mean Facebook accounts for 43% of all traffic, but just the sources that Parse.ly is able to get data on. Tony Haile, CEO of the traffic-analytics firm Chartbeat, said that his company 2019s data shows a similar theme: although Google has a much broader range of sites it sends traffic to via search, the larger news and media sites have become much more reliant on Facebook. 201cWhen we look at all the sites over our network, a third have more Facebook traffic than Google, 201d he said. 201cBut when we only look at the largest 20%, about half of them have more traffic from Facebook than Google. 201d Although there 2019s no question that social sharing has become a much more important source of traffic in its own right, the Parse.ly CTO said that a change in Google 2019s referral practices may also have played a role. While the search company used to show publishers what keywords were used to direct the most traffic to their articles, in most cases it doesn 2019t provide that kind of data any more. The company says this is for security reasons, but Montalenti says it could also be because Google doesn 2019t want publishers to game its algorithm. Whatever the reasoning, that lack of insight into what kind of traffic is coming from Google and why could have helped contribute to a lack of interest in SEO and growing interest in using social platforms such as Facebook and Twitter TWTR . Facebook has also been trying to court media companies and get them to host more of their content on the site, Montalenti noted, through efforts such as the Instant Articles project it announced earlier this year. The only problem with that shift, the Parse.ly CTO says, is that Facebook is almost as impenetrable as Google when it comes to trying to figure out why one article did well and another didn 2019t. And that makes it difficult for publishers to build a coherent social-media strategy. 201cThere 2019s a lot of effort among media companies being placed on specific social channels like Twitter, but our data shows that Twitter is basically a distant traffic source, 201d says Montalenti. 201cThat 2019s unfortunate because Facebook is a lot less transparent around things like how the algorithm functions. There 2019s a lot more useful data from Twitter about their content, but FB is more like a black box in terms of how it operates. And yet it 2019s this huge and growing traffic source. 201d You can follow Mathew Ingram on Twitter at @mathewi, and read all of his posts here or via his RSS feed.

   "input": "Every year in America, over 30,000 people are killed in road or highway accidents. You may not find that number shocking, but there was a time when traffic deaths were considered a tragic scourge. In the 1930s, for instance, the authorities of Washington, D.C. would hoist a skull and crossbones to note each local traffic fatality. But over the decades, that sense of gravity faded, and traffic deaths have come to seem like background noise. To take a recent example, the deaths of two Amtrak rail workers in an early April accident was fairly big news, and the company launched an internal investigation. Meanwhile, around 100 highway workers die in road work zone collisions every year, making up around 2% of all workplace fatalities 2014and it 2019s rarely discussed. We seem to assume that trains are inherently safe, and take it equally for granted that roads are deadly. Get Data Sheet, Fortune 2019s technology newsletter. Some critics say transportation authorities helped cultivate that blas 00e9 attitude by celebrating declines in fatality rates, allowing them to deliver 2018good 2019 news most years, even as auto crashes remained a leading cause of death in the U.S. It became a widespread (though often implicit) assumption that there is a balance to be struck between safety and efficiency 2014that, in essence, a working road system involves some inevitable amount of death. Now, a movement called Vision Zero is working to overturn that way of thinking. The idea, which originated in Sweden in the 1990s, is to measure traffic fatalities not against percentages or trendlines, but against the very simple goal of eliminating them altogether. Anything short of that, the thinking goes, is a failure, with no number of deaths outweighing potential benefits in transportation efficiency. Vision Zero also involves a big shift in thinking about responsibility in traffic collisions. As one of the architects of the movement has put it, 201cthe accident is not the major problem 201d 2014blame for collisions is thought to lie more with poor planning than with individual driver error. That principle encourages planners to obsess about details like blind turns, confusing intersections, and dangerous on ramps. Since implementing Vision Zero, Sweden 2019s rate of traffic fatalities has dropped by half, and is now around one fourth of the U.S. rate. That success has helped the idea catch on with U.S. cities in recent years, and some version of Vision Zero has been adopted by Washington, D.C., New York City, Los Angeles, and Boston, among others. New York 2019s Vision Zero project strikes a characteristic tone of emotional gravity: 201cEach fatal crash that is averted, 201d reads the city 2019s Year Two report, 201cMeans that there are families and friend that will not have to feel the pain and grief that comes with the death of a loved one. 201d New York says its 2015 traffic fatality rate is the lowest since 1910. In New York and nationwide, of course, recent reductions come at the end of a long downward trend. Through the 1960s and 1970s, U.S. traffic death rates were as high as 26 per 100,000 people, and in the past decade that 2019s dropped to a little over 10. That has been thanks in large part to better drunk driving enforcement, and to improved vehicle safety, with airbags and crumple zones preventing more passenger and driver deaths. But the death rate for pedestrians, who don 2019t benefit from safety features like airbags, has declined much less, and helping cars coexist with pedestrians and cyclists is a major focus of Vision Zero. In Sweden, that has meant things like protected bike lanes, and lowering urban speed limits from around 30 miles per hour, where a collision with a pedestrian has an 80% mortality rate, to below 20 miles per hour, where that rate is closer to 10%. For more on building smarter cities, watch: The shift to prioritize pedestrian safety over driver convenience coincides with U.S. trends towards more people living in dense, walkable urban areas. And despite Vision Zero 2019s humanistic rhetoric, making a city safer for pedestrians could have serious long-term economic impacts, by keeping more residents healthy and working, lowering medical costs, and maybe even attracting more of the creative urban types who now drive the economy. There may be another factor in the growing appeal of an aggressive approach to traffic safety. For the last half-decade, boosters of autonomous vehicles have said that they 2019ll improve traffic safety by taking human fallibility out of the equation. That ambitious goal could still be many years away 2014but the idea alone makes it harder to take the grim tally of traffic deaths for granted.  ",

   "input": "1996-09-15 04:00:00 PDT Los Angeles -- A black hood covered his face. He wore a black skirt. His head was slumped against a leather strap chained to the headboard of the king-size bed in the sparsely furnished living room. Kevin Gilbert,29, was dead. That much his manager could see peering in at the front door that morning last May. The Los Angeles County coroner's office sees four or five such deaths a year -- autoerotic asphyxiation , caused when people go one small step too far in depriving their brains of oxygen while they reach orgasm. It was a death without dignity , a random fall through the cracks of a secret life. Gilbert was a prodigy musician from San Mateo who could play any instrument; colleagues invariably called him the most talented musician I ever met. To the rest of the world , though, his only real claim to fame lies in the credits to Tuesday Night Music Club , the 1993 debut album by Sheryl Crow. I saw something in Entertainment magazine that said Kevin Gilbert , the piano player on Sheryl Crow's record, had died, said songwriter David Baerwald , a member of the Tuesday club of the album's name. He paused, sadly shaking his head. He hated that Sheryl Crow record and that's all he's going to be known for. The piano player? Roll over , Kevin Gilbert. When Gilbert first brought his girlfriend Sheryl to informal Tuesday night songwriting sessions with his friends , he played a pivotal role in shaping an $85 million megahit. For her, the album brought three Grammys, stardom and an industry buzz that makes her forthcoming CD one of the most eagerly anticipated releases this fall. But for him, it was hardly a triumph. I don't know if I can ever forgive her , he wrote in his journal. I don't hate her -- I'm just soooo disappointed. In a way it's a classic Hollywood tale: Gifted boy artist meets girl artist , mentors her to success and is left in the dust -- equal parts Sunset Boulevard , A Star Is Born and All About Eve. By any measure , Gilbert's career was a fitful tumble of brilliance and happenstance, a series of near misses and one hit that wasn't his. And his Tuesday night cohorts describe Crow -- who refused to be interviewed for this story -- as a marginally talented singer who exploited his skills and theirs in a ruthless grab for success. But this wasn't a movie, and so the real story is inevitably messier and more complex. As the circumstances of his death suggest, Gilbert had a dark side, a hidden face making him an enigma to his friends. There was a history of antidepressants, a string of journal entries registering acute self-loathing and doubt. Once, he wrote about feeling intimidated when meeting a well-known session musician at a concert. I suck , he wrote , circling the words for emphasis. He had a promising start. As a South Bay teenager, Gilbert was given the run of Sunnyvale's Sensa Sound studio after hours; there, he recorded tracks with his progressive rock group, Giraffe. In 1988 he won the U.S. and worldwide finals of a talent contest run by the Yamaha piano company. One of the judges -- Pat Leonard, a producer for Madonna -- invited Gilbert to make a record in Los Angeles. That album, Toy Matinee , sold nearly 200 ,000 copies in 1991, thanks in part to an MTV video featuring actress Rosanna Arquette (whom Gilbert had dated). Gilbert put together a road version that included his then current girlfriend on background vocals and second keyboard -- Sheryl Crow. Making that album, Gilbert, at 21, met another record producer, Bill Bottrell, who became a kind of father figure. Bottrell brought him to sessions for Madonna and Michael Jackson; before long, Gilbert had sublet the space adjacent to Bottrell's Pasadena studio, Toad Hall. From there he set about recording his solo debut. Drawing on all his perfectionist instincts, along with his ingrained self-doubts, Gilbert didn't just work on his record; he suffered over it, recording and rerecording, polishing, tweaking, rethinking, redoing. It was a long process , said Bottrell , who used to hear Gilbert thumping away through the common wall. He sat over there endless nights. In August 1992 , Bottrell convened Gilbert and other musicians at Toad Hall with the simple agenda of collaborating for the fun of it every Tuesday night. We were all good , not to be immodest, Baerwald said. We were also all cynical , embittered by the process of pop music. We were trying to find some joy in music again. A party atmosphere predominated -- Bill would sift through (the music) the next morning while we were all nursing hangovers , drummer Brian MacLeod recalled. Then Bottrell introduced a project he thought might force a little focus onto the freewheeling , chaotic sessions. Crow had finished an album for A&M Records, but despite the $500,000 spent on it, nobody at the label was thrilled with the results. Hoping for a quick fix, A&M hired Gilbert to remix the album, which was, in the immutable illogic of the record industry, already scheduled for release. Crow's manager asked Bottrell to step in as well. On Crow's first Tuesday night with the club, Baerwald showed up with musical sidekick David Ricketts (from the 1986 David and David album), both of them high on LSD, with the first verse already written to a song, Leaving Las Vegas. Baerwald picked up a guitar , Ricketts the bass, and the band fell together to pick up where it had left off. Baerwald couldn't function , said Bottrell. Sheryl started to get drunk. I was looking for that moment when the good take would happen. For most of that year , Bottrell and his Tuesday crew -- now working all week long -- scrupulously fashioned and reshaped Crow's album. Because everything was a collaboration, songwriting credits were equally shared. Everybody was equal , said Baerwald , except Sheryl. She wasn't one of us. We helped her make a record. Gilbert's name wound up on seven of the 11 songs; he sang and played keyboards , guitar, bass and drums. His relationship with Crow was kept separate and even a secret from the group. I'd see long conversations in the parking lot , Baerwald said. Kevin challenged her , MacLeod said. He was trying to get her to be honest and sing from her heart. Unsure of herself , professionally in over her head, Crow went home with Gilbert after sessions and listened to him rant about the industry's failings. She had Kevin filling her with doubts , Bottrell said. When he wasn't with Crow or the club , Gilbert struggled with his solo album, playing most of the instruments on his supple but powerful pop-rock tracks -- polished productions that showed the gleam of countless studio hours. A proposed deal with a major label fell apart, so he made do with a tiny custom label. After nearly a year of working together, all for one and one for all, the Tuesday Night musicians were shocked to learn they didn't figure into any more of Crow's plans. Bottrell got the news when he met her to hand over the finished master in a Sunset Strip coffee shop. Although there had been much talk of hitting the road together to promote the record -- bassist Dan Schwartz even bought a new bass for the tour -- she essentially told me to get lost , Bottrell said. I add Sheryl Crow to a long list of people in Hollywood who told me they were my friend until they got what they wanted from me , Schwartz said. As Crow's relationship with Gilbert deteriorated -- apparently she turned her attentions to an executive at the record label , Baerwald said -- an increasingly bitter Gilbert threw himself deeper into his own album. I think I'm a tinge jealous over her upcoming release , he wrote in his journal. It's probably going to be huge so I have to prepare myself mentally for that. If she gets what she wants after behaving this way , she'll be absolutely intolerable. For Gilbert , the final straw came when Crow sang Leaving Las Vegas on the David Letterman show. Afterward , when Letterman asked her if the song was autobiographical, a flustered Crow blurted out, Yes. I've never been to Las Vegas , continued Crow , who nobody remembers having contributed greatly to the writing of the song. I wrote it about Los Angeles. It's really metaphorical. The next day , she and Gilbert exchanged angry words over the phone. He wasn't the only one furious. Author John O'Brien -- who wrote the novel that inspired both Baerwald's early song lyrics and the movie starring Nicolas Cage -- was still grumbling about Crow's gaffe to his literary agent on the day he blew his brains out, a scant few weeks before the movie deal was complete. As Crow's album soared on the charts (her nod to Gilbert in the liner notes says, I owe you big for two years of musical and emotional support. Thanks) , Gilbert's solo album, a masterful but underpromoted effort titled Thud , disappeared almost immediately on release. At the same time , ironically, a tape he recorded for the Led Zeppelin tribute album, dropped from the disc at the last minute, exploded on Los Angeles radio, leaving his label ineptly scrambling to capitalize. Despite its new prominence, the Tuesday Night Music Club never could quite regroup. The members did play one guest appearance with Crow at an out-of-town club, but the record company made it clear they would not be included in the more prestigious Hollywood show. Gilbert threw himself into other projects: helping Baerwald produce a solo album by Susannah Hoffs of the Bangles, working with Bottrell on an album by Linda Perry of 4 Non Blondes (the Tuesday night gang dubbed her the anti- Sheryl) , writing and recording scores for TV shows under a pseudonym. He even produced a movie soundtrack song for which Crow sang vocals -- a version of Steve Miller's The Joker -- although they were never in the studio at the same time. In November 1994 , Gilbert met playwright Cintra Wilson at a party in San Francisco; two months later she moved to Los Angeles to live with him. He was massively depressed over the whole Sheryl debacle , Wilson said. I was a basket case. We were perfect for each other. Despite the tension with Crow , most of the Tuesday Night Music Club attended the Grammy Awards in March 1995. To show irreverence, Wilson rented 19th century funeral regalia for Gilbert and her to wear: a morning coat and top hat for him, ostrich plumes and a bustle for her. Crow sat in the row in front of them. They were not on good terms , Wilson said. She was tensely gracious. It was a furtive , tense, real glitzy night. Crow picked up three awards , including Record of the Year for All I Wanna Do , a Tuesday Night instrumental with lyrics borrowed from verses in a little-known volume by a poet in Vermont. A week later , Gilbert was still wearing his Grammy medallion around his neck like a badge of valor. From there, he set out to recapture the creative anarchy he felt was the authentic legacy of the club. He and MacLeod produced some startling recordings, far removed from anything either of them had ever done. They were scary, dense, pop-industrial recordings, with Gilbert whispering ominous, almost threatening processed vocals. They gave me nightmares , Bottrell said. Gilbert envisioned a new band , Kaviar, clad in fetish rubber gear. He pulled other musicians into the plan. At the same time, Gilbert could toss off simple, beautiful, sentimental tunes. In Baerwald's last memory of Gilbert, the pianist was noodling around on the keyboard, plaintively singing Randy Newman's Marie. Baerwald had briefly dozed off. I woke up crying , he said. Bottrell , who played perhaps the largest role in Gilbert's career, doesn't think he ever really knew him. There were tremendous areas of his life I was not privy to , he said. There were motives I could never quite figure out. But Bottrell's wife , Elizabeth, remembers sensing a powerful mood of peace and reconciliation in a phone conversation with Gilbert the afternoon before he died. They talked about attending an industry dinner together; Gilbert kidded her about wearing rubber. They never spoke again. On an afternoon this summer, several hundred of Gilbert's friends and associates gathered for a memorial service at the Bottrells' Glendale home. Wilson, dressed in white, sat next to MacLeod as Crow walked up to say hello. I barked at her , Wilson recalled. Wilson knew the titles of the album's songs well enough. Run , baby, run, she yelped at Crow , who fled in tears. Although Crow is reluctant to discuss Gilbert, she has been openly vocal in interviews about the rift over the album with the Tuesday Night Music Club. There were guys in the group who were feeling bitter about the record doing so well , she recently told Billboard magazine. Maybe I should have called it something else. Later this month , she will release her follow-up album, titled, not insignificantly, perhaps even defiantly, Sheryl Crow -- a two- word title that speaks volumes. Clearly , this singer wants to prove that she's an act and a talent all her own -- not the smoke-and-mirrors creation of a savvy, multitalented backup band. She did mention Gilbert to a Dutch journalist in an interview last month. I wasn't surprised by his death , Crow told Edwin Ammerlaan of Orr Magazine. Kevin was one of the most self-destructive people I've ever met. I don't want to go into this too much , but it wasn't a nice story.  ",

Poland, a staunchly Roman Catholic country, is one of the few places in Europe where women can only get a legal abortion if there is proof of rape or incest, if the mother 2019s life is endangered, or if the fetus is severely malformed. The drugs scheduled for delivery on June 27 are mifepristone and misoprostol. They can be taken without medical supervision for pregnancies of less than nine weeks, Women on Waves says.

Women on Waves adds that, since the drone won 2019t be flying through controlled air space and weighs less than 5 kg, it does not require authorization from the Polish or the German government.  ",

But those desires are running into some headwinds from regulators. The British advertising regulator, for example, has reprimanded BuzzFeed UK for running a 201clisticle 201d sponsored by Dylon 2014a maker of color dye for clothing, and a subsidiary of German 2019s Henkel AG 2014that the agency said was not properly identified as advertising. The post was entitled 201c14 Laundry Fails We 2019ve All Experienced, 201d and consisted of posts and photos taken from various social-media platforms that showed mistakes involving laundry. Where the byline of a reporter would normally appear, it said 201cDylon, brand publisher. 201d According to the regulator, the article (which has since been removed) also included a live feed from Dylon 2019s Facebook page, as well as a sentence at the end that said 201cIt 2019s at times like these we are thankful that Dylon Colour Catcher is there to save us. 201d WATCH: Refinery29 talks about native advertising The Advertising Standards Authority said that where the article appeared on BuzzFeed 2019s home page and other pages, it was sufficient that it was identified as 201cpromoted content 201d and Dylon was credited as the publisher. But on the actual article page itself, the agency said it wasn 2019t clear enough that it was promoted or sponsored content. 201c[The labelling] was not sufficient to make clear that the main content of the web page was an advertorial, 201d the ASA ruling says. 201cWe further noted that the web page was very long and visitors to it would therefore not see the reference to Dylon Colour Catcher at the bottom of the page until they had already engaged with the content. 201d The agency also ruled that the term 201cbrand publisher 201d was not sufficient to convey the commercial nature of the content to consumers, and said the ad 201cmust not appear again in its current form. 201d In addition to BuzzFeed, the British regulator also recently reprimanded The Telegraph for what it said was a misleading advertorial for tires, and last year it ordered Instagram to remove a post from Kim Kardashian that promoted a morning-sickness medicine. SIGN UP: Get Data Sheet, Fortune 2019s daily newsletter about the business of technology. A BuzzFeed UK spokesman told the Guardian that the company would be reviewing its practices in light of the decision. The publisher also said in a comment to the regulator that since the British agency had not made very many decisions related to native advertising, the company was forced to rely on the standards of its U.S.-based parent. The U.S. regulator, meanwhile, has also been cracking down on sponsored content. The Federal Trade Commission, which handles advertising standards, recently released new rules for how such ads are identified. Among other things, the new standards say that simply using terms such as 201cpromoted by 201d isn 2019t enough to identify native advertising. When it comes to labelling, the FTC said, advertisers shouldn 2019t use terms such as 201cpromoted 201d because 201cthey are at best ambiguous and potentially could mislead consumers that advertising content is endorsed by a publisher. 201d  ",

   "input": "Make room for a side of tater tots with your cereal. Post Holdings, which makes popular cereals such as Raisin Bran and Fruity Pebbles, reportedly held recent deal talks with packaged foods giant ConAgra Foods regarding the latter 2019s frozen-potato business. According to the Wall Street Journal, those talks 2014which sputtered out but could still be revived 2014revolved around the prospect of Post combining with the ConAgra subsidiary Lamb Weston, which makes a range of frozen potato products 2014from fries to tots 2014as well as various frozen appetizers. The Journal reports that the deal 2014which would be structured as something called a Reverse Morris Trust, where a company carves out one of its subsidiaries and then merges it with another company 2014would value Lamb Weston at roughly $6 billion. Shares of Post rose slightly Tuesday following the report, pushing the cereal-maker 2019s market value over $5 billion. Fortune reached out to both Post and ConAgra for comment and will update this article with any response. It was only five years ago that ConAgra had Post in its sights as part of its proposed deal to acquire Ralcorp, which was Post 2019s parent company at the time. Instead, Ralcorp spun off Post to its shareholders a year before ConAgra eventually did acquire Ralcorp in a 2012 deal worth almost $5 billion. However, ConAgra 2019s new CEO, Sean Connolly, has been busy cutting costs in what analysts assume is preparation for a sale of the packaged foods company. Last summer, ConAgra sold off the struggling private label business it acquired in the Ralcorp deal and Connolly has also reportedly been considering a spin-off of Lamb Weston for months. Meanwhile, Post has been expanding its business through acquisitions such as last year 2019s $1 billion deal for MOM Brands, which makes bagged and hot cereals, as well as a 2014 deal to acquire Michael Foods for $2.45 billion.

   "input": "This is the first post for Re-Tooled, a regular series by Fortune Senior Writer Phil Wahba that looks at how once-struggling brands have rejuvenated themselves. A brand never succeeds by trying to be all things to all people. Just ask the people who run Timberland. The brand of high-performance outdoor footwear and apparel is booming again. The company, owned by VF Corp VFC , saw revenue rise more than 15% to $1.8 billion last year, and its operating profit rate climbed for the fourth year in a row, to 13%. And Timberland has ambitious plans to reach $3.1 billion in revenues and 18% margins in 2019, fueled by a bigger emphasis on higher-income city dwellers around the globe who love the outdoors, and perhaps more importantly, the outdoors look. Not that long ago, the brand was in a rut: When VF bought New Hampshire-based Timberland for $2 billion in 2011, the brand 2019s sales were stuck at the same levels as in 2006, and its operating margin at about 8%. What 2019s more, Timberland didn 2019t seem to know what it stood for. Enter VF, which also owns brands like The North Face and Vans. VF, the world 2019s largest apparel maker, gave Timberland tools it didn 2019t have before, and prompted it to zero in on what it did best and aim to reach a more targeted set of customers. Timberland 2019s brand president, Stewart Whitney, recently hosted Fortune at its store in New York 2019s SoHo district. Whitney, a 15-year Timberland veteran who became its head last year after overseeing its Asia expansion for six years, explained how Timberland got back on track, and how it plans to achieve its ambitious 2019 goals. Timberland had fallen into the trap that ensnares countless brands: trying to cater to practically everyone. The company, which started life in 1955 as the Abington Shoe Company before becoming Timberland in 1978, sent signals to consumers that by turns indicated it was a boot brand, or a casual apparel brand, or an outdoor outerwear brand for hardcore adventurers. The marketing identity crisis ultimately confused consumers, failing to make clear enough what set Timberland apart. 201cThe fact that we didn 2019t stand for anything distinctly meant we didn 2019t really resonate, 201d says Whitney. Just compare these three ads from a few years ago, before VF came in: they splinter the message, not making it clear whether Timberland is about technical and outdoor performance, green virtues, or outdoor fashion. In contrast, look at this ad from its current campaign, focusing on stylish urbanites: VF, a $13 billion apparel behemoth, gave Timberland the resources the small New Hamphire-based company didn 2019t have: firepower to conduct well-funded, deep dive market research. Armed with that muscle, Timberland undertook a three-year study, conducting long interviews with 18,000 consumers in eight countries. Its conclusion: Timberland 2019s target customers should be what it calls 201coutdoor lifestylers, 201d or city dwellers who like the outdoors but want footwear and clothes that have more style than purely outdoor brands. (This also helps Timberland avoid competing too directly with sister-brand The North Face.) Timberland customers made it clear they wanted shoes, boots and clothes that were more versatile 2013in other words, attire that they could wear in town without looking like they were about to climb Mount Everest. That led the company to build up its men 2019s casual wear assortment, to add more style so Timberland wares could be worn in cities and suburbs as well as out in the country, and to start to build a women 2019s casual footwear business. All that was through the lens of that 201coutdoor lifestyle 201d enthusiast, which Whitney says makes up about 20% of people in any market. 201cWhen you go after lots of consumers, with lots of messages, the odds are higher for a misfire, 201d he says. By repositioning itself at a higher end and being more focused, Timberland was able to shift away from promotions, meaning fewer items ending up in a clearance bin or in an outlet mall; the strategy also won the brand more pricing power. Timberland in 2013 relaunched its North American apparel business, armed with VF 2019s enormous production, distribution and sourcing firepower. Prior to that, Timberland had been outsourcing clothing production to VF rival PVH PVH , owner of the Izod, Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brands, among others. Timberland still gets about 80% of its sales from footwear. But with its push to add more style to its clothing, as evidenced by its Black Forest line (featured in the ad above), it needs more control over production 2013something it now has 2013so it can add or remove products from its assortment more quickly. Even as Timberland plans a big push abroad, it won 2019t try to pepper target markets with stores everywhere. (Most of its sales are via wholesale to other stores rather than through its own stores.) Rather, the focus is on what Whitney calls 201cfortress markets, 201d or larger urban markets across key regions. What 2019s more, Timberland has eliminated many products in its assortment to focus on the specific items that sell well. 201cThat helps you elevate the brand, and when you elevate the brand, you elevate your selling prices, your margins and your profile, 201d Whitney says.

   "input": "The first painting by the Dutch master Johannes Vermeer to come to auction in more than 80 years -- and one that for decades has been suspected of being fake -- sold for $30 million Wednesday night at Sotheby's here. The overflowing salesroom burst into applause when George Gordon, an expert in the Sotheby's old-master paintings department, took the winning bid by telephone. While the auction house is not saying who the buyer was, it is believed to be Stephen A. Wynn, the Las Vegas casino owner. For years Mr. Wynn has acquired trophy paintings by the great masters: Rembrandt, Rubens, C 00e9zanne, Renoir, Picasso and Sargent. He hangs them in galleries that are part of his establishments. Other possible buyers, experts say, could have been the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles. (Scott J. Schaefer, its chief curator, was in the audience) and Lord Thomson of Fleet, one of the richest men in Canada. Still, most experts in the room thought the buyer was Mr. Wynn. If it was, he was one of seven determined bidders. Robert Noortman, an old-master paintings dealer based in Maastricht, the Netherlands, also tried hard to buy the painting. He stopped bidding at $25.7 million. Mr. Noortman, who was sitting in the front row, said before the auction that he wanted to buy it for his inventory. ''Whoever bought the picture outbid one of the most experienced dealers in the business,'' said Rachel Mauro, a Manhattan art dealer who was at the sale. ''As a Vermeer -- and I happen to believe it really is a Vermeer -- the price isn't that crazy. If it did go to Las Vegas, it would certainly look good there.'' The sale price of the painting includes Sotheby's commission: 20 percent of the first $100,000 and 12 percent of the rest. ''We were extremely pleased,'' said Alexander Bell, head of Sotheby's old-master paintings department in London. ''It is unlikely that a painting by Vermeer will ever come to the market again.'' When Sotheby's first announced the sale in March, auction house officials estimated it would bring $5.4 million, a price far lower than what a second-rate Impressionist painting might fetch at auction. They were obviously nervous. For decades the authenticity of the painting, ''Young Woman Seated at the Virginal,'' has been in dispute. But after 10 years of study and testing by a group of scholars, museum curators, painting conservators, costume experts, paint analysts and auction house experts, Sotheby's said it was confident it was genuine. Sotheby's promoted the auction vigorously with advertising, hoping to attract collectors from around the world. Vermeer's popularity has been fueled in recent months by the best-selling novel ''Girl With a Pearl Earring'' and the 2003 movie based on it. The painting, which served as the cover image on the old-master sales catalog this year, has an entry that is 22 pages long and includes an extensive history as well as pictures of color pigment tests. The canvas is small -- 10 by 8 inches -- and dates from around 1670. It shows an intimate scene of a young woman seated at a virginal, a type of harpsichord, with her eyes gazing directly at the viewer. It is the last genre scene by this artist in private hands apart from one owned by Queen Elizabeth II. The last Vermeer to appear at auction was ''The Little Street'' (1658-1660), which was included in a sale in Amsterdam in 1921. It failed to sell and was later bought by a collector who donated it to the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. While technical evidence had supported the theory that ''Young Woman Seated at the Virginal'' was by Vermeer, it was not until the process of cleaning the canvas was completed about six months ago in the Netherlands by Martin Bijl, the former head of painting conservation at the Rijksmuseum, that the majority of experts and scholars endorsed the painting. Until now only 34 paintings have been fully accepted as by Vermeer, who was not a prolific artist and who died young, at 43, in 1675. Nobody had disagreed with the attribution until Han van Meegeren, a master forger, revealed a half-century ago that between 1927 and 1943 he had sold fake Vermeers to unsuspecting museums and collectors. The art scholar A. B. de Vries then excluded this painting from an important monograph. For much of the 20th century the painting languished in near obscurity. From the description in a 17th-century sales catalog, the painting once belonged to Pieter van Ruijven, Vermeer's most important patron. By the early 19th century, it was owned by Wessel Ryers, a Dutch collector. By 1904 it was documented as a Vermeer in the collection of Sir Alfred Beit, a collector in Ireland, who also owned the artist's famous ''Lady Writing a Letter to Her Maid.'' In 1960 the painting was sold to Baron Freddy Rolin, a Belgian dealer, who died in 2001. It is his family who sold the painting now. Experts at Sotheby's compared it to two larger Vermeers at the National Gallery in London, ''A Lady Standing at the Virginal'' and another portrait of a lady seated at a virginal, both also late paintings by the artist. The auction house and Baron Rolin also consulted Libby Sheldon, who runs the paintings analysis unit at University College in London. She analyzed the pigments and was able to find corresponding ones used by the artist in authenticated works. Ms. Sheldon also studied the painting's canvas and discovered that it matched the one used in ''The Lacemaker,'' which is in the Louvre. ''The two are so similar,'' Ms. Sheldon said, ''they could have been cut from the same bolt of cloth.''  ",

   "input": "About a third of all Internet transactions are returned by shoppers, according to the Wall Street Journal, so retailers are pushing clever tactics to help shoppers make choices that they will keep. Thayer Meicler, co-founder of the free location-based app SaleSorter, says shopper behavior differs in an actual store compared with online. The National Retail Federation estimates that online sales will increase 13 to 15 percent this year. I would imagine the rate of in-store returns is much smaller than online because consumers know exactly what they are buying when they pick something out in stores so there are far fewer surprises , Meicler said. The National Retail Federation said $58 billion in goods are expected to be returned this holiday season but it does not have data that shows the rate or dollar amount specifically of online shopping returns. Meicler points to quarterly data from the Commerce Department that reported about 94 percent of retail sales occur offline , which she said may be driven by the desire to try on items, see and understand the quality and materials of items, to compare potential purchases and more. Given this , it is not surprising that online returns are rising, as consumers don't always have clarity as to what they are buying and expectations of what the item is may be made of, she said. Fashion retail site Rue La La is trying to tackle the high rate of returns with a test program that allows customers to see their order history with sizing information , to help make sure they want to make a purchase. Through Rue La La's service, a customer who has repeatedly bought the same brand of dress shirts in both a small and a medium could see a notice asking, Are you sure you want to order the small? The last five times you ordered both sizes , you only kept the medium, Chief Executive Steve Davis told the Wall Street Journal. The website , which also offers a mobile shopping app, has tried to make shipping and returns easier, by charging a flat $9.95 for a customer's first purchase, which then provides free standard shipping for every order you place for 30 days. If you return an item for merchandise credit, you get free return shipping. But if you want a traditional refund you have to pay the return shipping costs. Though shoppers are in the last day of Christmas gift shopping, it may be worthwhile to delay shopping for yourself until after the holidays, says Meicler. She said she expects to see discounts in stores to continue after Christmas, which consumers can track with SaleSorter. Consumers should shop early in the day to get the best sale items before they are picked over and to take advantage of door buster offers at many big-box retailers , Meicler said.  ",

But that's not good enough for Phillip Torrone, an associate editor at Make magazine. Today, he'll be demonstrating how to combine the Roomba, which starts at $150, with other devices to create cross-bred robots that can do more than just clean house. Where do you find crowds eager to learn how to convert a vacuum cleaner into something less useful but more interesting? At RoboNexus, the all-dancing, all-wrestling, all-floor-cleaning robot trade show at the San Jose Convention Center through the weekend. The show, billed as the largest robotics event in the Western Hemisphere, is in its second year in Silicon Valley. More than 10,000 guests are expected over its three-day run. On Friday, the show floor was mobbed with local grade-school and middle-school kids crowding around displays, eating free Twizzlers and Tootsie Pops, and venturing to touch some of the cutest products the technology industry has to offer. Look , he's a baby spider! said Raena Gountang ,9, snapping a photo of a low-to-the-ground robot that skittered around on four slender legs. Gountang was with one of several classes from Toyon Elementary School in San Jose whose teachers took them to see the show Friday. Other Toyon kids gravitated toward the cuddly Paro, an animatronic white seal that interacts with patients in Japanese nursing homes and hospitals. But Leandro Ruvalcava,10, said he preferred the Roboraptor, a remote-control dinosaur display by the toy company WowWee, because It can bite you. A Chronicle test confirmed that the robotic dinosaur , made by the company that last year had a holiday hit with the Robosapien robot, will indeed gently gnaw on a finger placed in its mouth. Many of the robots on display were designed as educational tools. A small squadron of $800-to-$1,000 robots that danced a synchronized ballet on a table, turned cartwheels and did kung fu moves were designed by San Diego's Hitech Robotics to teach high school and university students to program. The Botball Robotics Program achieves a similar goal using robots crafted out of Lego bricks and Nintendo GameBoy Advance handheld video game players. And Lego itself, the Danish maker of the interlocking blocks that played a central role in so many engineers' childhoods, touted its own educational initiatives. Then there were the more brutish bots: machines that work for NASA, the military and the Department of Homeland Security, and wrestling robots brought by the Robotics Society of America to promote upcoming San Francisco competitions where robotic arms pull no punches. Just as designer Jin Sato showed off his wrestling robot, a bolt flew off the machine, and one of the watching kids caught it. What if that happens in competition? I will lose , Sato acknowledged with a sheepish grin. Hard-core robot carnage from fighters like this can be seen the second weekend of November at Fort Mason at the ComBots Cup and National Championship. In March , a competition called RoboGames in San Francisco will feature robot wrestling as well as other challenges such as firefighting, bartending and stair climbing. Stair climbing is actually one of the toughest of all challenges faced by robot-kind, said David Calkins, president of the Robotics Society. You never see robots going upstairs in movies. It's very difficult , he said. A company on the other side of the show floor was showing off its plans to control an arm that NASA will use to repair the aging Hubbell Space Telescope. This work by Innova Holdings of Fort Myers Beach , Fla., could enable the telescope to stay in space until as late as 2020, said Walter Weisel, chief executive. And American Standard Robotics showed off a squat, rolling bot designed to save lives. The Disaster Crawler, which looks like a toy tank tethered to a long electrical cord, was used to explore collapsed apartment buildings in Biloxi after Hurricane Katrina, searching for survivors. It carried out the same mission in the rubble of the World Trade Center after Sept. 11, 2001. The same robots could be used as first responders in a gas attack on a subway system, said the company's president and CEO Mark Micire, something much on Americans' minds with the reported threat to New York City subways. Less practical, more esoteric robot pursuits will also be explored. Several sessions over the weekend will delve into robot art, as in art created by robots on their own or via commands from remote human beings. This afternoon, Joanne Pransky, a marketer and public speaker who bills herself as the world's first robotic psychiatrist, will expound on the social issues involved in robotics, such as mankind's responsibility for its robotic children and the human fear of technology going awry that science fiction writer Isaac Asimov called the Frankenstein complex. There's always going to be that fear , that robots will take control, said Pransky , who raises examples of robots that become positive contributors to society, like the mechanical pets gaining popularity in Japan. Entry to RoboNexus is $20 for adults, $15 for kids over 5, and free for younger children. Where: San Jose Convention Center How much: $20 for adults, $15 for kids over 5, and free for younger children.  ",

Damon later apologized for his comment. A representative from HBO told Fortune that the fourth season of Project Greenlight fell to 1.3 million viewers, and that it was was initially imagined as a one-season revival, deciding in early 2016 that another season 201cdid not make sense for us. 201d 201cWe are proud of the show and were pleased with its run throughout the years, 201d said HBO in a statement.

Koch opened his twice-a-year keynote speech to his political allies with a dire assessment of the White House contenders. In an afternoon address at the grand Broadmoor Resort, to 400 guests who donated at least $100,000 to the Koch network, he said the priority of his groups would be the keep Republican majorities in the Senate and the House to block bad proposals from either White House winner. 201cThe first thing I want to do is to correct a rumor that the media keeps stimulating and that is that I am probably going to support Hillary.

   "input": "Lasering is a lengthy, expensive procedure - costs vary but the average is about 00a3200 a session, with the number of sessions needed depending on the size and colour. Nor is it ever guaranteed to totally remove a tattoo. Explains Danielle Young, aesthetic manager at the private Epsom Skin Clinics where Rebecca was treated: ''Historically, the only way to get rid of a tattoo was to cover it with skin-coloured ink, or cut it out. But we can now offer laser techniques with differing degrees of intensity. 2019 2019 While conventional laser is passed over a tattoo just once on each appointment, the latest technique, called the R20, enables the beam to pass over the skin four times a session, with a 20 minute gap between each pass for the skin to cool. Although it is hot enough to cause blisters and pain, the laser doesn 2019t cause long term surface damage. 201cMost people feel it as a hot, sharp and fast sensation, 201d says Danielle. 201cIt is more uncomfortable than having a tattoo, but not so uncomfortable that clients don 2019t want to come back for their next session. 2019 2019 Most people need a course of treatments, which have to be staggered up to eight weeks apart to allow complete healing in between, although for those who have the R20 laser, the treatment works more rapidly. So is it worth it? Rebecca who began her treatment last autumn says: ''I have had eight sessions of R20 now, and frustratingly there is little change. I am disappointed as I felt sure it would have begun to go. The clinic think that brown ink must have been mixed with the black originally, and that we will now have to switch to a more suitable laser. So I guess I will just have to carry on. 201d She adds: ''I will have spent about 00a31,000 in the end. I just want it gone now. 2019 2019 Danielle warns that some people will always be left with ''ghosting 2019 2019 - a shadowy outline - depending on the size and colour of the original design; and that lasers do not yet exist (although they are in development) which will remove certain blues or light greens, or pale colours like yellow or pink. Nor are lasers recommended for darker skins, as there is a risk the laser will strip out natural pigmentation and leave white scarring. Some tattoos may have caused skin scarring during the initial ink tattooing process, which can be revealed after the colour is stripped out. Claims are also being made for an alternative therapy in which special liquid is injected into the tattoo, just as the ink was initially. The liquid is said to bond with the colour pigments, and both are then broken down and excreted by the body, leaving a scab behind which should heal normally. The treatment is cheaper than laser but Stuart Harrison, the director of Oxford Skin Clinics, which offers this treatment, admits that it isn 2019t suitable for old, deep or overly large tattoos. 201cIt would end up being very expensive and removal could take years, 201d he says. Tattoo removal is rarely carried out on the NHS. Prof Harry Moseley, head of the Department of Plastic Surgery at Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, Dundee and head of the British Medical Laser Association, says: ''At our NHS clinic we do carry out tattoo removal but only in a small number of cases where the patient is severely distressed. 2019 The side effects of laser removal can include not only pain but ongoing skin sensitivity and infection; which is why, according to Prof Moseley, it is vital that therapists are properly trained. He would like to see all laser operators required to 201cdemonstrate necessary knowledge and skill 201d and belong to a registered profession, so they 201ccould be struck off if they were negligent. 2019 2019 Not everyone agrees with the claim that laser is just ''uncomfortable 2019 2019. Like Rebecca, Charley Monroe, a 24-year-old receptionist from Croydon, had a tattoo on impulse five years ago. ''I instantly regretted it - my 'design 2019, a small piece of tribal style art, on my forearm, looked awful straight away. 2019 2019 However she gave up on laser treatment after one session. ''I had never felt anything so sickeningly and excruciatingly painful as those 10 minutes the skin was under the laser; I couldn 2019t imagine doing that again one more time, let alone 10 more times. 201c Charley went to consultant plastic surgeon Paul Banwell, whose private cosmetic surgery clinic in East Grinstead offers surgical removal of tattoos. Surgical excision is not new, is no cheaper than laser therapy (an average tattoo might cost between 00a3850- 00a31,400 to remove), and ultimately takes as long. However, being carried out under local anaesthetic, it is painless and the tattoo is guaranteed to be removed completely. In late 2010, Mr Banwell removed Charley 2019s tattoo in a ''serial excision 2019 2019 procedure comprising four different surgeries spaced out over the next two and a half years; the gaps in between the surgeries allowed for healing and skin to stretch again. The excision literally involved cutting out the pieces of ink-stained skin in stages and stitching the area back, to leave minimal scaring. Mr Banwell says: ''There are limitations to surgical removal; it wouldn 2019t work for large tattoos or where the skin is naturally taut, or where the whole of a limb is affected such as a tattoo 'sleeve 2019 on the arm. The only way to get rid of a large tattoo by excision would be to treat it like a tumour removal or burn treatment, so that means cutting out all the affected skin, and then using a graft to repair the hole. ''It would leave significant scarring, but there are patients who are so traumatised by their tattoos they will go to those lengths. 2019 2019 In the future, it is possible the high-tech skin substitutes used in burns units may be used to build new skin. Charley Monroe says now she is immensely relieved that her 201c hideous black blotch 201d has gone forever. 201c I can forget all about that mistake 2013 I feel liberated. 2019 2019 * For more information, visit http: www.banwellclinic.com and http: www.epsomskinclinics.com See Charley Monroe 2019s blog at http: everythingtattooremoval.tumblr.com  ",

   "input": "NT Chief Minster Adam Giles. (AAP) The ABC's 4 Corners program on abuse within Darwin's youth detention centre put a target on the chief minister's back and was orchestrated to do his government damage during an election campaign, he says. Adam Giles accused the ABC of deliberately timing the broadcast of the episode on the Don Dale centre ahead of the August 27 poll, and told Sky News on Thursday that it was intended to give the Labor opposition a leg up. When questioned by journalists in Alice Springs on what evidence he had to support his allegation , Mr Giles said: I was just asked for my opinion and that's my opinion. If 4 Corners want to get in the middle of an election campaign they've done a pretty good job of it ... I think certainly when you're going to run a program just weeks out from the Territory election it does point to something , he said. Mr Giles said the program put a target on the back of myself and my colleagues and those in the corrections industry. I've been particularly targeted , I've had death threats, other colleagues of mine have had death threats over a report of something that was done six years ago, he said. When asked if his comments were a deflection of the government's responsibility , he said: I've stood up and said we take responsibility for what happened before I was even in government and we're doing that and we're providing change , working with the federal government on the royal commission, but I don't think it's wrong to point out the timing of the show that's gone to air. He said the program had stirred up racial tensions in the NT , a jurisdiction where over 85 per cent of adult prisoners and about 98 per cent of juvenile detainees are indigenous. I think this needs to be put into context , I don't think it's fair, I don't think it's reasonable, he said , adding that his government had been trying to find a balance between the indigenous and non-indigenous communities and to see an episode such as that now stir up racial divide in the NT , I think it's appalling, I think it's racist and I'm absolutely disgusted with what they've done. 4 Corners executive producer Sally Neighbour tweeted: Adam Giles' claim is false , outrageous and desperate. Mr Giles has been criticised for his handling of the scandal , with outgoing Country Liberals backbencher Matt Conlan publicly calling on him to stop blaming others, but Mr Giles said he was absolutely happy with how he handled the matter. On Thursday evening , Mr Giles took to his Facebook page, saying that despite his Aboriginal heritage he thought of himself as Australian. In politics as a principle I have never sought to use this to my advantage nor disadvantage , he wrote. While never taking the bait over many years I have been politically attacked on racial grounds. These attacks have been repeated and promoted in many media outlets. I've copped it sweet. I've risen above it all. He said the one-sided 4 Corners reporting made him and his government look racist. We aren't. In fact we bust our guts to restore the balance between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal in the NT. He said that NT Labor Opposition Leader Michael Gunner even went so far as to refer to me as being off the reservation , on ABC of course. What does that mean Michael? The expression is a racially-charged reference to native Americans who challenged white authority. Mr Gunner said he used the expression to express that Mr Giles was out of touch when claiming the 4 Corners story was politically motivated. I have since learned that the phrase has racist connotations. I was honestly not aware of that , he wrote on his Facebook page on Thursday night. I will never use that phrase ever again. I genuinely apologise to Adam , and anyone else hurt by my using the phrase.  ",

They had previously won silver at the 2011 World Championships after only eight months of competitive sailing together. Clark was twice a World Championship medallist in partnership with Christina Bassadone, but she awaits her first Olympic medal. After giving up on selection for the 2004 Olympics, Clark drifted into working in corporate events and says it was the kick up the backside I needed because I knew I wanted to get to the Olympics. She came sixth in Beijing and then experimented with a succession of partners before settling on double gold medallist Sarah Ayton. However , Ayton retired suddenly 18 months prior to the 2012 Olympics in order to concentrate on motherhood. Born in Colchester, Clark took up sailing as it was a family hobby and she says it was the first thing she beat her sister at.  ",

European Union officials had counted on Spain, one of the bloc 2019s largest economies, to accept a large share of the tens of thousands of migrants who have entered Europe in recent weeks via Hungary, Italy and Greece. Last week, however, conservative Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said Spain would limit itself to a June commitment to receive 2,749 people, far fewer than the 4,288 the European Commission had first proposed. Mr. Rajoy argued that Spain 2019s 22.4% unemployment rate, among the highest in the region, would complicate the country 2019s efforts to absorb refugees. Spain 2019s new pledge brings to 17,680 the total number of refugees the country will take in. The government 2019s decision follows calls by political opposition leaders to open Spain 2019s door wider. Some local officials offered their cities 2019 own resources for migrants and refugees to put pressure on the government and to channel the outpouring of sympathy from many Spaniards to the plight of Syrians and others who have been fleeing conflict zones and risking their lives to reach safety in Europe. In Madrid, which elected a leftist mayor this year, officials this week unfurled a big sign on city hall declaring 201cRefugees Welcome 201d in English. City officials said they planned to spend an additional 20ac10 million ($11.2 million) starting in January to bolster housing and health services for refugees. In the eastern Valencia region, officials have alerted the central government that they have nearly 400 beds available immediately in youth summer camp lodges. Spanish press reports said Mr. Rajoy also came under German pressure to accept more refugees. The prime minister and some of his cabinet members changed their tune this week, saying they would accept the quota requested as part of a broader plan for the EU. 201cWe are working hard to ensure that these people are guaranteed not only reception, but, in the medium and long term, the integration that they deserve in our country, 201d Deputy Prime Minister Soraya S 00e1enz de Santamar 00eda said Wednesday. Last week, Ms. S 00e1enz de Santamar 00eda had argued that Spain 2019s capacity to absorb refugees was saturated. Write to Jeannette Neumann at jeannette.neumann@wsj.com  ",

According to Geoscience Australia, there have been 15 aftershocks since the earthquake was recorded at 2.30pm (AEST), some 70km off the coast of Bowen. The latest was a magnitude-3.0 tremor at 7.37am on Friday which followed a magnitude-4.1 tremor at 4.27am. Geoscience Australia senior seismologist Jonathan Bathgate said the magnitude of the Bowen earthquake was significant but not the biggest in recent years in Australia. We had an earthquake in Northern Territory earlier which was 6.1 and that was the largest earthquake in 20 years and it has certainly been an active 12 months for earthquakes in Australia. Had the epicentre of Thursday's quake been on land it may have had the potential to do more damage than the Newcastle earthquake in the late 1980s that claimed 13 lives , he said. It was bigger than the Newcastle earthquake so in comparison to that it certainly had the potential to do some significant damage , he told AAP.  ",

   "input": "There is just one thing: the word 201cofficial. 201d Used to describe Frazier's title, it's a pejorative. The fly in the ointment, of course, is Muhammad Ali, for merly Cassius Clay and formerly the official world heavyweight champion, who after a three 2010and 2010a 2010 half 2010year involuntary retirement began a triumphal comeback three weeks ago in Atlanta by deftly cutting up the No. 1 heavyweight contender, Jerry Quarry. Ali's title and boxing license had been snatched back in June,1967, when the New York State Athletic Commission and the World Boxing Association ruled that a fighter who would not fight with a gun in Vietnam could not fight with his fists in the ring and did not deserve the prestigious title he had won there. Since then, Ali has been free on bail pending an appeal 2014now before the U.S. Supreme Court 2014but unable, until the Atlanta bout, to persuade any state or municipality to sanction even a nontitle bout. Excommunicated by boxing's inner circle, the outspoken, controversial and unbeaten Ali has never lost his champion status in the hearts of his many fans. Nor, for that matter, did he lose it right away in the minds of his even more numerous foes, who grudgingly admitted that, like the man said, he was the greatest. Now, however, the Quarry fight not withstanding, there is doubt. Three and a half years have passed since Ali dominated the heavyweight division so completely that, had retirement not been thrust upon him, he would probably have had to seize it 2014to give the other fellow a chance. During those three and a half years, Joe Frazier has fought convincingly 15 times, finally winning the vacated title over half a dozen contenders, including the hapless Quarry, while Ali has gone only three rounds in the prize ring. Who really is the champ? It is a question that keeps boxing fans awake at night. And now that a Federal court has found the New York Athletic Commission's treatment of Ali 201carbitrary and unreasonable 201d and ordered it to reissue the ex 2010 champion his boxing license, they may expect to get some sleep beginning sometime next February or March. Until then, the heavyweight champion of the world, Joe Frazier, remains best 2010known as the one fighter around who might 2014just might 2014 whip Ali. 201cI'LL whup him good, 201d says Frazier into the crisp autumn darkness. 201cClay's easier to hit in the body than anywhere 2014sticks his head back and his body out. And I'm a body puncher. 201d Frazier is breathing hard, but his voice is matter 2010of 2010fact. It is 5:30 A.M., with no hint yet of dawn. Frazier is running on a back road in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains where he has holed up for five weeks to train for his fight with Foster. Above us, a waning moon breaks fitfully through the cloud cover. At our backs the headlights of a slow 2010moving station wagon show the way. Our rhythmic shadows stretch out on the dirt road ahead. Leading the car over a rise, we plunge forward into black pools. Frazier is swathed in clothes from his hooded head to the heavy logger's boots on his feet. Some 20 minutes earlier, in his motel room, strewn with athletic gear and record albums, I'd watched him pull on one layer of sweat clothes after another, five in all, pick up the small steel weight he carries in his left hand when he runs, and head off into the night. Suddenly, there is a crashing in the underbrush and from an embankment a deer leaps onto the road directly in front of us, is transfixed for an instant in the headlights, and is gone. 201cMan, how about that! 201d The image blends in both our minds with the red and white carcass of a buck that Frazier had skinned at the motel just the night be for. The animal had been struck by a car and brought dead to the kitchen door. To break the monotony of camp life, Frazier, wearing an apron over his black one 2010piece, short sleeved jump suit, the sleeves of his red shirt turned back, had skinned it, using the skills he learned working in a kosher slaughterhouse when, at the age of 17, he had first arrived in Philadelphia from his home in Beau fort, S. C. In the grand old American tradi tion, Frazier, who quit school in the ninth grade, had left the farm he grew up on as the youngest son in a family of 13 children and had followed some of his brothers and sisters north to the urban ghetto that is North Philadelphia. At the time, he had not yet reached his full height, but he already weighed more than 230 pounds. To lose weight, he started working out at the Philadel phia Police Athletic League gym, pounding the big bag just as he used to slug a gunny sack filled with sand and old rags as a kid in the mule shed down on the farm. 201cI'm going to be the next Joe Louis, 201d a sister of his remembers him bragging. 201cYeah, he always wanted to be a fighter, long as I've known him, 201d says his wife, Florence, who grew up on a nearby Beaufort farm. 201cThe singing, that came later. 201d 201cI first came into the gym to take off weight, 201d Frazier says, recalling the moment when his fighting career actually began. 201cMy legs was too big. I couldn't buy inexpensive clothes 2019cause I couldn't get fit. So I began working out and pretty soon I found out I had a pretty good punch. I had my share of street fights as a kid and nobody ever beat me and I just figured nobody could whip me. It's like I still feel. 201d That is when road work began for Frazier. Three mornings out of four, for nearly a decade, Joe has risen be fore dawn and gone out to run for a half 2010hour or more 2014before the traffic gets so heavy that a man can't breathe. Exhaust fumes and nosy motorists were no problem in the training camp at Vacation Valley near East Strouds burg 2014or on the Jersey shore or at the Concord in the Catskills, where Frazier has trained for past fights 2014 but they are on the roads around his Philadelphia home, and habit is habit. Moreover, getting up to punish one's body when the rest of the world is sleeping is the sort of lonely, Spartan act of will that men who make their living in the ring must endure. Joe's legs might get the same workout if he ran at 9 in the morning, but his determination would get flabby, and with Frazier, even more than with most boxers, will and determination are where it's at. 201cI've had plenty of other boxers with more raw talent, 201d claims his manager 2010trainer, Yancey Durham, in his deep sonorous voice that inspired Red Smith to dub him the black Ev Dirksen, 201cbut none with more dedication and strength. 201d DEDICATION and strength were certainly the operative words the first time I met Joe Frazier. He was ap pearing last May with his nightclub act at the Latin Casino in Cherry Hill, N. J., booked in that Colosseum 2010sized roadhouse for a week's stand between Sammy Davis Jr. and Dionne War wick. It was his first time on stage since he had broken his ankle doing a knee 2010together split in a similar act out in Las Vegas. Here is how the finals at the Latin Casino went: Joe, center stage, is clutching the mike like something he's been chewing on. Now he rips off his olive jacket with white piping. His matching pants, in some slippery 2010 looking material, have bell 2010bottoms slit to above the calf, with pearl but tons on the cuffs to hold the flaps together. He tosses the wadded 2010up jacket back to Lester Peleman, his band leader 2014the same route his black bow tie went a song or two be fore. And there he is, ladies and gentlemen, 230 pounds, his face beaded with sweat, solid as a rock, all of a piece, regal and primitive, his close 2010cropped head glistening in the white spotlights, a new black beard pouring in a smooth curve down his cheeks and across his broad chin, the muscles of his neck descend ing from his small ears in two strong columns set on massive shoulders. It's a flat face, a good face for a fighter, without ridges or protrusions to split the skin when it's slammed into with an 8 2010ounce leather glove. His yellow ruffled shirt is open at the collar, soaked through front and back 2014dark where it touches his chocolate body, lighter on the still dry ruffles. Now, without the double 2010 breasted jacket buttoned across his hips, the full, unbelievable size of his thighs shows. How could he ever be knocked down? His center of gravity must be several feet below the stage, and when he crouches down and throws a few gut punches, like a hori zontal pile driver, he seems ready to meet the charge of a bull rhinoceros. The music swells still louder and the whole troupe comes on stage. 201cKnock on Wood 201d is the crescendo number 2014and all together they knock hard. White spots flicker on and off, giving movement a jerky, silent 2010movie quality, only there is no silence. Joe is bobbing, weaving, shadowboxing in the middle of the bedlam, almost swallowing the mike as he fills it with words, the diamond ring on his pinkie throwing off fire. Beside him two miniclad go 2010go dancers prance and jiggle, trading mock, velvet punches with Frazier 2014hired, shouts a p.r. man into my ear, to relieve Joe of his dancing duties until the ankle wholly heals. A black trio called the Blue Belles wails; Peleman whangs a tambourine and turns up the volume. Frazier's not smoking, man, he on fire, and ain't nobody sitting down front in the three 2010quar ters empty Latin Casino dining room who isn't himself dangerously near the point of ignition. It's an artless, powerful, mind 2010blowing show. In his dressing room afterward, Frazier sighs, wearily, contentedly: 201cWhooee, that really takes it out of you. I'd just as soon go 15 rounds with Bonavena. 201d He is puffing through his nose like a fighter still biting on his rubber mouthpiece and sweating just as he would be the next time I saw him working out 2014 this time at his gym in North Phila delphia. ACTUALLY, the gym does not belong to Frazier, it belongs to the 800 2010plus stockholders of Cloverlay, Frazier needed an angel; he got a full choir Inc., just as Frazier, himself, does 2014 at least until February,1974, when his contract expires. Possibly the most unusual feature of Joe Frazier is not his two 2010fisted wading 2010in style of boxing, which is reminiscent of the late Rocky Marciano, but the organi zation that has backed him for the past six years. It is hard enough for a boxer to survive if he is single, but in 1965, when the 21 2010year 2010old Frazier turned professional, he already had three mouths to feed besides his own. There was Florence, short, pretty, with the same gentle Beaufort lilt to her voice as her husband's, and, she says, the same weight problem. ( 201cI tell Joe in camp 2014 he calls several times a day 2014 it's not how much you eat, it's what you eat. 201d) The two had met at her grandfather's funeral and were married two years later, when he was 17, she only 15. The two other mouths came along in quick succession, a boy and a girl, eventually to be followed by three more girls. There was one thing, though: as a father at 18, he was draft 2010 exempt. (How do you like them apples, Muhammad?) During the most desperate time of their lives, after Frazier had returned to Philadelphia, albeit as an Olym pic champion, but unable either to work or box because of his broken thumb, they survived on the $60 a week Florence brought home from a factory job, plus the gifts of well wishers. When Frazier was able to use his hand again, his pastor, the Rev. Wil liam Gray, hired him as an odd 2010job man around the Bright Hope Baptist Church. Although Mr. Gray was a most sympathetic employer, the rou tine of getting up at 5 in the morn ing to run, working around the church and somehow fitting in enough time to train for the five fights he had that first year was too much. What he needed while he learned the trade was an angel. What he got was a full choir. Through the good offices of Mr. Gray, Frazier and Durham made con tact with a wealthy Philadelphia businessman, F. Bruce Baldwin, for mer chairman of Horn & Hardart and, more important, a fight buff. Baldwin was interested in backing the Olym pic champion, but not alone. When he sounded out some of his friends about forming a syndicate on the order of the 12 2010man group that had started Clay on his way in Louisville, he got such an enthusiastic response that it was decided to create a cor poration instead. Eighty 2010eight shares of stock were issued to 40 partici pants, at $250 apiece, and the name Cloverlay was chosen 2014 a Joycean contraction of clover, for luck, and overlay, meaning a good bet. The rules were roughly this: a con tract with Frazier was drawn that would run for three years, with an option on the part of the corporation to renew for two subsequent three year periods 2014an option that Clover lay has been quick to exercise. Frazier was guaranteed a starting salary of $100 per week, plus 50 per cent of his winnings, if any, half to be added pro rata to his weekly salary, half to be invested for him in a trust fund. Durham would draw 15 per cent, split the same way, while with the help of the remaining 35 per cent, Cloverlay would pay all ex penses. For the original 40 stockholders, most of whom report that they kicked in simply for the fun of owning a piece of a fighter, but held little hope of ever recovering their $250, the in vestment was a gold mine. At pres ent, Cloverlay boasts some 800 stock holders. An original $250 share, figur ing splits and re 2010evaluations, is worth nearly $15,000. Cloverlay, with a monthly payroll of some $9,0, has two other unbeaten fighters under contract, middleweight Willie (the Worm) Monroe and light heavy weight Len Hutchins, and has diver sified into real estate worth some $1.5 2010million, including the gym on North Broad Street, which opened last April. Before Cloverlay acquired its own facility, Frazier trained at the P.A.L. gym where he first started boxing. It was there, a year ago, that he and Ali nearly teed off for a pre view of their promised fight 2014 and for free, at that. It seems that on a local talk show Ali had called Frazier flat 2010footed, slow and without class. 201cHe came here to run me out of my hometown. If I don't take him on, he'll try to run me out of my own house next, 201d retorted Frazier and suggested that Ali come on down to the gym and repeat his criticism. Ali came, but so did more than 1,000 would 2010be spectators, which is about 950 more than the gym can hold. Po lice told the boxers, already stripped for action, to move their fight to the park. Ali dressed and headed for Fair mount Park, this time with a mob that had grown to 2,000. 201cHe wants to show he can whip me, 201d shouted the ex 2010champion on his way out. 201cHe says he's the champ. Let him prove it in the ghetto, where the colored folks can see it. 201d But Frazier did not fol 201cHere I am, 201d taunted Ali, when he reached the park. 201cHaven't had a fight in three years, 25 pounds over weight, and Joe Frazier won't show up. What kind of a champ can he be? 201d 201cA smart one, 201d says Durham. 201cJoe wasn't going to have a street fight in Fairmount Park and Clay wasn't about to either. 201d Of course, that was just the sort of newsmaking blather that Ali dotes on. A more accurate expression of the relationship between the two Philadelphia 2010based boxers was prob ably expressed by an earlier en counter, reported by Frazier: 201cI met Clay in a restaurant, a couple of years ago, and he yelled, 2018There's the champ, 2019 pointing to me. 2018You just keep whuppin 2019 those guys, champ, and I'll fight Uncle, meaning Uncle Sam. 201d THE new gym is a converted ball room in the shadow of the Penn Cen tral station in North Philadelphia. A large plate 2010glass window covers the front, protected by a wire mesh through which pink fingers are twined flanking youthful wide 2010eyed black faces. Crammed inside, like a big bed in a small room, is an 18 2010foot boxing ring fenced around with blue, red and white ropes. Next to the walls hang a pair of rat 2010a 2010tat 2010tat speed bags and a couple of the long ponderous leather bags that Frazier whomps with such evident zest. The locker rooms and the office are up a short flight of steps in the rear. On a Thursday morning a couple of months ago, Frazier in green pants and a black 2010and 2010white flowered shirt arrived at the gym around 11, and checked in at the office to find out what calls needed answer ing. The most urgent was one from the White House asking Frazier to be on the President's Commission on Athletics. He would. A half hour later, he was searching under back issues of Billboard and Ring Magazine, open ing and slamming the drawers of his wooden desk. He couldn't find the keys to his Cadillac parked on the sidewalk in front of the gym. Through an interior window of the office Frazier could look down on the practice ring, beside which, amidst a swirl of wires, amplifiers and loudspeakers, the Knockouts were practicing. Grabbing up a microphone, he called out, 201cHey, any you guys seen my car keys? 201d The words coming through the loud speaker blended at first with the deafening electric beat down below, which then suddenly died, and the question, repeated, came over loud and clear. The keys, attached to a Martin Luther King medallion, were eventually found on top of the bongo drum, and Frazier, with me in tow, headed off downtown to fill a sub scription for vitamin pills. 201cMost days I eat only one meal. The vitamins keep me sharp, 201d he explained. Lumbering off the sidewalk, he spun the gold, air 2010conditioned custom Coupe DeVille in a U 2010turn across the surging traffic of North Broad as if it were a carnival bumper car. Miss ing one startled woman in a Chevvy by a bare inch, he swore amiably and added with a sly wink, 201cI don't know what's wrong with the drivers today. 201d After which, we suddenly pulled two G's into the bucket seats as the big car shot ahead. He pushed a button and the sun roof slid back. He tried the tele phone. It didn't work. He jiggled it, shook it, gave it a piece of his mind. I mentioned that the one time I rode with Muhammad Ali, his car phone did not work either. 201cYou mean you actually rode in that piece of junk? 201d said Frazier, re ferring to Ali's pink Eldorado, con tempt dripping from his voice. 201cYou wouldn't catch me dead in that thing, man. 201d Frazier loves cars, loves driving them and puttering with them. His new house has a garage that holds six. He claims he can take any car apart and put it together again. But most of all he loves his bike, a shim mering blue Harley 2010Davidson Electra Glide. 201cYou know how fast I once had my bike up to? A hundred and ten miles an hour. I felt powerful, man. 201d He has had a number of minor scrapes on his bike, and in 1968 he and his brother 2010in 2010law, who was riding with him, had a serious accident on its predecessor that left a scar on Frazier's left cheek 2014 the only time he has been cut on the face. Cloverlay stockholders and Yancey Durham pull long faces when they are asked about Frazier's penchant for bike riding. BACK at the gym that afternoon, Frazier is working out, as he does most afternoons when he's home in Philadelphia. Music to fight by 2014the same mixture of soul and rock that he sings 2014is coming out of a portable loudspeaker set on the floor. He goes six rounds, shadowboxing in the ring and then a couple of rounds each on the small and big bags. Dressed in green coveralls, Yancey Durham is standing at a corner of the ring, one arm hooked over the top rope, an unlit cigar thrust aggressively out of the side of his mouth. 201cYa got one, Joe, ya got one, 201d he intones quietly, in dicating one minute to go in the simulated round. Durham, up until a few years ago, worked as a structural welder for the railroad. But as a former professional boxer himself and an occasional trainer of moderate success, he kept his foot in the door of the not overly fastidious world of Philadelphia box ing. Although he claims it is not so, Durham's fate line made a right 2010 angled turn on the day, nine years ago, that he first spotted Frazier working out in the P.A.L. gym. From the vantage of hindsight, it is obvious that the two were made for each other. Durham was, as he still is, a mature, highly articulate, strong ly opinionated, entirely self 2010confident product of Camden's black middle class, who knows and relishes the fight game. Frazier, at the time they met, was young, naive, enormously strong, untroubled by the least pre tention that he knew anything about boxing and willing to put himself en tirely in Durham's hands. It was the classic manager 2010fighter relationship. And it has endured 2014be cause Durham, who still has an enormous effect on Frazier and who still uses the managerial first person ( 201cI'm going to knock out Foster just as quick as I can 201d 2014 201cI'll fight Clay anyplace, any time 201d), knows when to pull back and shut up, while Frazier appears to be entirely free of any overblown sense of self, or the sort of vindictive loss of memory so often experienced by those who have made it big toward those who helped them up. During his amateur days, with Durham encouraging him, Frazier trained hard, running in the morn ing before reporting to work at the meat plant, boxing at night at the P.A.L. gym. He won the Middle At lantic A.A.U. championship in 1963 and 1964. All told, he had 37 amateur bouts and lost only twice 2014both times to Buster Mathis, a huge fat boy who was touted as the next Cassius Clay, if he could just lose a substantial portion of his 300 pounds. Frazier's second loss to Mathis, by a decision, was in the finals of the Olympic tryouts, and it almost ended his career. He went out to California, however, to train with the team as an alternate in case something happened to Mathis. It did. While sparring with Frazier, Buster dislocated a thumb, and Frazier went to Japan in his place. In the semifinal round in Tokyo, Frazier knocked out the Russian entry. Doing so, he, in turn, broke his thumb. Mindful of what had hap pened to Mathis, he kept quiet about the injury. 201cI'd gone all that way, I couldn't let one hand pull me back. 201d The 201cone hand 201d happened to be his left 2014with which he throws his best punch, a crunching left hook. Films of the final, in which Frazier was matched against Hans Huber, a huge, broad 2010shouldered German, show the much bigger man constantly backing up and leaning away from Frazier's left. Had he known the excruciating pain Frazier experienced every time he landed that left hook, Huber might not have been so careful to stay away from it, and the decision of the judges 2014 three to two for Frazier 2014might well have gone the other way. 201cIt was a measure of the strength and determination of the man, 201d Dur ham says over his shoulder, as Frazier continues to punch and grunt around the ring, 201cand I'll take that over raw talent any day. Joe wasn't a boxer then; he was a fighter 2014still is. 201d Now Willie the Worm has joined Frazier in the ring, shadowboxing by himself. Monroe, dancing on his toes, jabbing, ducking, backing off, flashing in and out on his imaginary opponent, is obviously a boxer. In contrast, Fra zier, the fighter, moves forward in his semicrouch, leading only slightly with his left shoulder, the tips of his el bows pointed out, forming a pyramid at his waist with his fists at the top, in front of his chin. They move in flurry, with all his beef behind them 2014rights, lefts, hooks, jabs, all to gether 2014 201cperpetual motion, 201d Durham calls it. 201cNo heavyweight ever has thrown punches as fast as Joe: 56 a minute. He can rack up 30 points a round; that's welterweight speed. He may not move around the ring so fast, but those hands 2014look out. 201d CLOVERLAY is Frazier's manager of record and the Cloverlay board of 10 directors (it was once 11, but one superpatriot quit after a de cision was taken to fight Ali, the draft dodger) ultimately rules on all major decisions regarding whom Frazier will fight, where, when and for how much. In practice, however, the decisions are made solely by Dur ham, and so far neither the Cloverlay board nor Frazier has had any ground for complaint. After Durham and Frazier signed with Cloverlay, the trainer 2010manager brought his boy along slowly, giving him easy matches through most of 1966, all of which he won by knock outs. His first serious test came when he fought Oscar Bonavena, the tough Argentine heavyweight (whom Ali will fight in New York on Dec. 7), in Madison Square Garden in Septem ber, 1966. Bonavena floored Frazier twice before the Philadelphian got up off the canvas to win a split decision after 10 rounds. From then on, it was a string of strong victories 2014climaxed by one against his for mer nemesis, Mathis, which gave him the New York State championship in 1968. THEN, last February, came the fight with Ellis, who held Ali's old World Boxing Association title by virtue of an elimination tournament that Fra zier had refused to enter. The fight lasted only four rounds. The judges awarded Ellis the first. He landed more punches than Frazier. But those at ringside heard the smiling Frazier, obviously enjoying himself, taunt his opponent as he bore in: 201cSissy, you can't hit. I'm taking everything you got, man, and you ain't hurtin me. 201d In the fourth round he floored Ellis twice with left hooks. The bell saved Ellis the second time, but it was all over. His trainer, Angelo Dundee (who is also Ali's trainer), slapped Ellis's thighs, put ice down his trunks, pinched him 2014 201cand he didn't do nothin', 201d as Dundee said later. 201cFree, free, free at last, 201d cried Frazier, dancing around the ring, arms outstretched. At the time, Ali was claiming that he was through with boxing forever, and Frazier was indeed free at the top. But now Ali's back, and Frazier has the job to do all over again 2014or, as many observ ers believe more likely, have it done to him. First, however, Frazier must dis patch Bob Foster. Training camp for the Foster fight, up until two weeks ago, when Frazier and company moved to Detroit, was Vacation Val ley in the Poconos, 201cA Resort Motel for Active Adults. 201d The setting is autumn at its peak, sunlight glinting off Echo Lake, shoals of leaves shift ing underfoot. The training ring is set up in a large heated shed across from the main lodge 2014$2 to see the champ train, 1 to 3 every afternoon. Frazier and Ray Anderson, one of his three sparring partners, are going at it hammer and tongs. Both are wearing the leather girdles that pro tect kidneys and groins. But only Frazier is wearing the padded spar ring helmet. Anderson, I learn later, has told Durham that he thinks he can take Frazier and he's doffed his helmet to prove the point. He's danc ing around the ring, moving away from Frazier, jabbing, circling to his left, keeping away from Frazier's left hook. Frazier comes after him, boring in behind a flurry of fists, grunting with exuberance each time he throws a hard punch, shrugging off the few jabs that Anderson lands. There is nothing complicated, noth ing cute about Frazier's approach to boxing. He obviously likes his work, likes to throw punches, likes to con nect. He's smoking now, not worry ing so much about blocking Ander son's jabs as keeping him off balance and on the defensive. It is a style that so far in his career has worked. Frazier bores in, pins Anderson against the ropes. Anderson protects his head, but absorbs massive body punches in the process. 201cYa got a half, Joe, ya got a half, 201d intones Durham, leaning on the ropes, watch ing his boy through heavy lids. Then: 201cO.K., time. 201d The two fighters break and circle their separate ways around the ring. Frazier biting on his mouthpiece, sucking in great drafts of air through his nose; Anderson, arms hanging limp, shaking off the terrible punishment he has taken. I'm reminded of an article Ali wrote after watching the Frazier 2010 Ellis bout. Besides announcing that he was really, definitely, through with the ring forever, he said: 201cFrazier ain't got no rhythm. He just keeps coming, punching from his knees up. Ducks and keeps coming, trying to get you on the ropes and hold you like some old robot. There wasn't no boxing in that fight with Ellis. When I was fighting, I boxed. You remember? Pop, pop, pop, pop 2014 dance around 2014pip, pip, pip, real fast 2014dancing and faking 2014WHAARUP! 2014back off and circle 2014pop, pop, rat 2010 a 2010ta 2010rata 2010ta 2010ta like a typewriter 2014 POW! That's championship fighting. Frazier can't do things like that. He's an old plowhorse. But I got more re spect for him now than I did before the Ellis fight. I only seen him fight once before that and he didn't show me nothing. But against Ellis he was pretty good for his kind of fighter. He wasn't afraid of nothing Ellis threw, he just kept on coming. And he had a tricky, fast left jab that surprised me. 201d HE was certainly surprising An derson that afternoon, and it seems very unlikely that Bob Foster will fare any better next Wednesday. Light heavyweights have taken shots at the heavyweight title before. None have made it. But what about Ali? By all accounts, he is as fast as any light heavyweight and he weighs some 30 to 40 pounds more. Durham, of course, knows his boy can take Ali. So does his boy. 201cYank's never been wrong yet, 201d he says. Quarry, who has now been beaten by both men, says Frazier will murder Ali, but that could be just wishful thinking. Don Warner, a Frazier sparring partner for the last three years, who has also absorbed the best punches of both men, has a somewhat more balanced answer to the most 2010asked question in boxing these days. It came as he stood by the ring waiting to replace Anderson, his face smeared with Vaseline, so as not to get cut, a gorgeous shiner on his right eye to attest to his words. 201cJoe's left hook is his most lethal weapon, 201d he said. 201cThe guy comes on like a locomotive. Clay has never fought anyone like him. I was on the same card with Clay once when he fought Henry Cooper. You know, he was floored then 2014and it was Cooper's left hook that caught him. 201cI wouldn't really want to say who will win, 201d he added, loyal both to his own past record and to his present employment, 201cbut one thing I do know, it will be one hell of a fight. 201d 25a0 We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.

The Australian Veterinary Association says recent heavy and unseasonal rain has left water lying around which has created a suitable habitat for mosquitos and other insects which can carry the myxoma virus. There is no cure for the virus so we urge rabbit owners to take precautions to prevent their rabbits being exposed to places where they may encounter mosquitoes and fleas, AVA state president Anne Fowler said on Wednesday. Myxomatosis is a poxvirus spread between rabbits by close contact with biting insects. The virus causes swelling and discharge from the eyes , nose and genital regions of infected rabbits. Dr Fowler said owners should check their yards and remove any items that might have collected water such as empty pot plants and bases, pet bowls or rubbish. Rabbit hutches should have a mosquito proof covering with the roof and the exterior and inside roof sprayed with a pet-friendly insect repellent. Litter trays should be changed daily as flies are attracted to faeces and urine.  ",

   "input": " 201cAs a general rule, 201d it was written in the 1920s, 201cNegroes have not been and are not thought of in America when you talk in general terms of Americans unless they are specifically pointed out. 201d This 201cgeneral forgetfulness 201d therefore made it 201cnecessary for those interested in fair play to all citizens 201d to propose a 201cbeautiful building 201d to 201cdepict the negro 2019s contribution to America in military service, in art, literature, invention, science, industry etc. 201d The text was part of a century-long campaign, started by black civil war veterans in 1915, that will reach its fulfilment on Saturday, when Barack Obama formally opens the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington DC. It describes with some precision what has finally been achieved. It also suggests what the museum 2019s director, Lonnie Bunch, says over and over: that the museum should give 201ca fuller understanding of what it means to be American 201d seen through the 201cparticular lens 201d of black experiences and contributions, not a place that is just about and for an anthropologically defined category known as African Americans. Because of restrictions on the above-ground volume of buildings on the National Mall, 60% of the museum is buried The moment, of course, is charged. A short walk away another building has opened in the heart of the federal administrative district: the chandelier-bedecked Trump International hotel, a possible encampment on the way to the White House for the man keen on the plainly racist fantasy that Obama was not really American-born, and who as a young property tycoon was accused of denying homes to black applicants. Trump 2019s combinations of obfuscation, cunning, bluster and force follow a pattern seen across the centuries in the museum 2019s accounts of the ways in which black freedom and advancement were blocked. The museum, the 19th to be created by the Smithsonian Institution, enacts further principles currently under attack, which are the importance of knowledge and fact, scrupulously gathered, and of shared spaces for their understanding. It is much for a single building and its contents to carry, especially one placed on the National Mall in Washington amid the icons of the nation 2013 the White House, the Capitol, great museums, memorials to wars and presidents. 201cHow does one compete with such a monumental landscape? 201d asks David Adjaye, the lead designer of an architectural team formed out of four practices for the purpose of this project called Freelon Adjaye Bond SmithGroup. This team is led by people of predominantly African American heritage, a rarity in the still very white profession of architecture, such as the lead architect Phil Freelon and the project leader Zena Howard. J Max Bond, a pioneer among black architects, was part of the group but died before the museum was finished. Adjaye is British, born in Tanzania to Ghanaian parents. The theme and content of the museum is therefore personal. 201cAs a young boy of my generation the African American story was also our story, 201d says Adjaye, who was born as the civil rights movement was gathering force in 1966, 201cin the sense that it was the techniques, the motivation, it was a way of being and it was a way of understanding that one could succeed in the modern world and not be oppressed by it. I feel it as part of my emerging into adulthood and being who I am. 201d It is indeed the content that should come before the architecture of the building that serves it. It includes artefacts of desperation and sheer survival, such as the shards of tools used by Maroons 2013 escaped slaves 2013 in their refuge in the Great Dismal Swamp of North Carolina. Also of violence, such as leg irons, and fragments of glass from the 1963 bombing that killed four young girls in the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama. There is exaltation, in the form of one of Chuck Berry 2019s bright red Cadillacs, of the recollected triumphs of Muhammad Ali, of the orange silk jacket and recorded singing of the contralto Marian Anderson. There is abundant film and photography of the struggles and grotesqueries of racial politics, such as the Ku Klux Klan march through Washington in 1925. Scraps of intimacy and poverty are interspersed with larger structures, such as wooden cabins inhabited by slaves and a watchtower from Angola prison in Louisiana. Objects of American transport technology contribute: a segregated railway carriage, a bright yellow-and-blue biplane used by the African American Tuskegee airmen, that Cadillac. Eventually you find the P-Funk Mothership, a spoof spacecraft that used to land on stage on the 1970s stadium tours of George Clinton and his band Parliament-Funkadelic. The collection is remarkable for the fact that, little more than a decade ago, it didn 2019t exist. Lonnie Bunch, on taking up his post in 2005, was armed with a Bush-signed act of Congress that supported the idea of the museum, but he had nothing to put in it. This could have been catastrophic, as the world is full of unconvincing museums founded on ideas but little content. So Bunch and his team toured the nation, inviting people to offer whatever they might have. The result is personal, eclectic, touching and surprising, rather than encyclopedic. The displays are sometimes overcrowded but avoid gimmicks and pointless gestures at interaction. They are text-heavy, partly to fill the gaps that arise from the nature of the collection, with a measured and sober tone. The exhibits are arranged in three main sections, starting with a narrative history, rising up from the bottom of a deep basement, that runs from the beginnings of the Atlantic slave trade in 15th-century Africa and Europe to the presidency of Barack Obama. On two upper floors, above the ground level entrance hall, are the community galleries, which talk about such things as religion, place, sport and military service, and the culture galleries, which show art, music, literature and performance. The museum thus climbs from slave ships to the mothership, an ascendant trajectory that maybe doesn 2019t do enough to avoid an oversimplified story of oppression ultimately redeemed by blues, funk and hip-hop. The museum nonetheless does an outstanding job of giving due weight to horrors and heroism, to people just living their lives and to the endless repeating stories of creativity prompted by oppression. Many of the histories are familiar even to non-Americans, such as that of Rosa Parks, but they are shown here with new weight. You are assailed by the mental force of something pushing from the back of your mind to the front. Was segregation really so cruel, so laughably hypocritical, so absurdly rigged and transparently unfair? Yes, it was. The official story of the design is already much told and doubtless will be repeated to the museum 2019s visitors for as long as it stands. The triple-decker superstructure of inverted truncated pyramids recalls the celebratory headpieces on certain Yoruba sculptures from west Africa and can also evoke, if you like, arms raised in celebration. They are made of bronze-finished aluminium whose filigree patterns derive from the decorative metalwork created by African American craftsmen in cities such as New Orleans and Charleston. A long, deep canopy that shelters the main entrance refers to the porches of southern houses that acted as social and political centres, little village halls, informal schools. These narratives are necessary, says Adjaye, for a project that was 201cdefinitely not done quietly on a mountain somewhere on my own 201d but had to 201cnegotiate a lot of positions and opinions to get this form. So it was really important that this was neither cloaked nor hidden. It was something that had to be absolutely clear and people had to understand why. 201d But such stories only get a building so far. They could describe an exhilarating work or a cringe-making one. What matters more are the relationships the architecture makes through its space and material between exhibits, people and surroundings. Here there are tensions between the institutional nature of a museum and its popular ambitions, between a search for authenticity and the tendency of modern museums to resemble shopping malls 2013 shiny, escalatored 2013 driven as they are by mall-like considerations of people moving and browsing. The design also has to deal with the contemporary habit of putting exhibitions in sealed boxes, where air and light are perfectly controlled, which makes for abrupt transitions with the rest of the world. It achieves its main, difficult task, which is to be both American and African American One technique that Adjaye tries is to create moments of crowd-pleasing charm 2013 a particular tone of purplish pink terrazzo in the entrance hall 2019s floor, coppery panels on the lifts, outbreaks of decoration as in an art deco cinema, something as simple as the rich blue over the entrance to the Oprah Winfrey theatre. There is an agile open loop of a spiral staircase going down to the basement, which also helps you forget that 2013 because of restrictions on the above-ground volume of buildings on the National Mall 2013 60% of the museum is buried. You might imagine something non-Caucasian in these hues and motifs, but at any rate they are different from the greys and creams of most Smithsonian museums. More substantially the building seeks to connect with its august surroundings, through views from decks outside the upper galleries that are sometimes filtered through the filigree screens and sometimes through openings specially oriented to particular monuments. The glass-walled ground floor allows views in all directions of both greenery and stone-pillared official architecture. At this point it feels embracing and inclusive. The hardest job the design has to do is to find a way to stand on its grand stage. It is placed at a corner where the grand axis emanating from the Capitol intersects at a right angle with that emanating from the White House, a cross pinned at its centre by the 555ft obelisk of the Washington monument. All around are white stone commemorations of white men, albeit often built with black labour. As a freestanding largely symmetrical object, the new museum has something in common with its neighbours, but as a dark-clad structure that eschews classical columns for apparently floating horizontal layers, it does not. Its suggestion of pyramids gives a geometrical echo of the obelisk (which, lest we forget, is Egyptian and therefore also African), but their inversion sets them apart. Adjaye doesn 2019t mind if a link is made between the dark skin of the building and that of the people it remembers, but he gives another reason for it. If it is not the main material for buildings on the National Mall, bronze is nonetheless used for the memorial detail of statuary and plaques. The role of the new museum is itself partly memorial, the idea having started off a century ago with the primary intent of honouring black soldiers. The bronze finish, for Adjaye, is 201cabsolutely from the classical family, but to express different ideas seemed like the right thing to do 201d. It takes some nerve to do a building like this, on this spot, and the design is confident enough to pull it off. It is not flawless, as it sometimes feels assembled or panellised more than crafted. The bronze-coloured screens are not the delicate, seamless things suggested in computer visualisations. The build-up of the exterior cladding 2013 glass wall plus screen plus substantial fixings for the latter 2013 impedes the sense of connection between inside and out. There are moments of gawkiness that can be engaging or uncomfortable, depending on your taste. But it achieves its main, difficult task, which is to be both American and African American, and to be of its location but also different from it. As a museum and as a building it enacts the tone that is so striking in the 1928 text 2013 its patience, reason and lack of rancour. It realises qualities of America at its best, ones which, as is now abundantly clear, we can 2019t take for granted. The new National Museum of African American History and Culture is the result of more than a century of efforts to commemorate the contributions of African Americans to their country. 1915 A group of civil war veterans, gathered to mark the 50th anniversary of its ending, organise a 201ccommittee of colored citizens 201d to build a monument. 1929 Congress permits a national commission to be set up, but it fails for lack of funding. 1968 Black leaders unsuccessfully press Congress for a museum. 1985 The owner of a bus-tour company, Tom Mack, starts a fundraising group. 1988 Congressman John Lewis, a civil rights veteran, unsuccessfully introduces a bill for a museum. He continues this battle for 15 years. 1994 A proposal to create a museum within a wing of an existing Smithsonian institution, already controversial because of its lack of ambition, is defeated. Republican senator Jesse Helms opposes it: 201cHow can Congress then say no to Hispanics, 201d he says, 201cand the next group, and the next group after that? 201d 2003 After bipartisan pressure George Bush signs legislation creating the National Museum of African American History and Culture. 2005 Lonnie Bunch is appointed director. The museum has a staff of two, no collection, no confirmed site, and needs to raise hundreds of millions of dollars. He launches Saving African American Treasures, a programme to encourage citizens to donate objects. 2006 A site is selected on the National Mall, Washington DC, the last of any size to remain undeveloped. 2009 Following the election of President Barack Obama, a team of architects is selected. 2016 The museum, designed by a team led by David Adjaye, is completed at a total cost of $540m. Its 37,000 exhibits range from the sombre to the joyful. They include the coffin of Emmett Till, the teenager who was mutilated and killed in 1955; the dazzling dresses of Whitney Houston and Dionne Warwick; and works by the self-taught 19th-century portrait painter Joshua Johnson.

The retailer is working with financial advisers on sale preparations, said the person, and the potential bidders are mostly other retailers. A representative for Kate Spade declined to comment. A sale would cap a comeback for a brand that struggled to recover from the last recession and had to rely on discounts to attract customers. Formerly named Fifth & Pacific, the company sold the Juicy Couture and Lucky brands in 2013 and 2014, leaving Kate Spade as its sole major nameplate. It has restored sales growth and burnished its image, and now charges full price for more of its handbags. It has also embarked on a plan to become a lifestyle brand, selling everything from apparel to home goods, with a goal of quadrupling revenue to $4 billion annually. 2014 BLOOMBERG NEWS Rhode Island 2019s second-largest hospital group, Care New England, reported a net loss of $53 million for the 2016 fiscal year, according to WPRI-TV, which obtained an audited financial statement.

That's got to be a cry for help. There were Met muppets , and big-headed Mets with pea brains. It was a real freak show out there. Only the knowledge that the Yankees will clinch this series at Shea, and that we Creatures would be dancing in celebration on the No. 7 subway platform in Flushing, made any of this bearable. Every year , every time they come in here for a new series, we get new Met fans here, said Chris Cartelli. You look at the jerseys they wear , there are no Seaver jerseys, no Dykstras. They're all black and orange. There's just no heritage there. Game 1 had gone smoothly enough on Saturday , once Benitez blew up in the ninth and the idiots in the stands were silenced. There were only a few minor incidents. One guy kept walking up and down the right-field bleachers in his Met outfit, taunting the Creatures in Section 39 for as long as the Mets held their lead. Which wasn't long enough, was it? Tina Lewis was forced to yell at regular intervals at the people standing on the steps, in front of her seat, telling them to get out of the way. She wanted to see something besides their fat, Met-loving rears. Anyway, the Creatures who were fortunate enough to get our hands on a few extra seats were outside the Stadium early in the evening last night, trying to make a few dollars selling tickets (we don't like the word scalping , because it carries negative connotations) while hoping to avoid the Anthony Suite set aside for us in the local jail. WE ARE NOT ripoff artists. Milton the Cowbell Man was hoping to sell $110 tickets for $500 , a reasonable markup you might see in Modell's. But it wasn't easy, because the cops were everywhere, and many of them were Met fans. You could tell, because they looked like cartoon characters. And if they could, they would be wearing goofy orange-and-black numbers on the back of their uniforms.  ",

   "input": "BY MITCHELL FINK WITH LAUREN RUBIN Thursday, May 10th 2001, 2:21AM New York Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik wants to write a memoir and power publisher Judith Regan wants to sell it. The two - who are self-made, results-oriented types - hit it off well the other night at a party Regan gave for Kerik at Palma, a new Italian restaurant in the West Village. Other guests at this event, which was touted as a literary salon , included Howard Stern; Newark City Councilman Cory Booker; screenwriter Richard LaGravenese; Revolution Studios honcho Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas; the host of the TV show Power of Attorney , Judge Andrew Napolitano , and Los Angeles designer Kelly Wearstler. Also on hand was a Regan favorite, Jess Walter, who would act as Kerik's co-writer. Walter, in case you've forgotten, worked on In Contempt with O.J. Simpson prosecutor Christopher Darden. He also has a first novel out , Over Tumbled Graves , about police work in Spokane , Wash. Kerik's deal with ReganBooks is not quite done. Regan declined to comment on its status, but Kerik must get permission from the city to write a book before he can sign a contract. The Commish did not return calls for comment. But from what I understand, most people who talked to Kerik at the dinner were convinced that his life - as a high-school dropout who came up through the police ranks - is a story filled with heartache, drama, murder and mayhem. Perfect for a book. DENISE FINDS SOMETHING TO CELEBRATE Now that she's been granted Pardongate immunity and given several TV interviews, Fifth Ave. songwriter Denise Rich is beefing up her social schedule. On Tuesday, she showed up at Patsy's on W. 56th St., for a birthday party for Tommy Silverman, president of Tommy Boy Records. The event attracted many figures from the doo-wop era, including Kenny Vance and the Planotones, the Harptones and Philadelphia disc jockey Jerry Blavat. Everyone sang, much to the delight of Rich, who sat with producer Nile Rodgers and talked music. Rich told me that I've learned a lot from the experience of seeing herself splashed across the front pages. I've learned not to not to take it personally. Now I know how celebrities feel. I don't go out on bad hair days. She reiterated that , contrary to some reports, she never had an affair with Bill Clinton. I was never alone with him in a room. Ever , she said , echoing her previous public comments. I said it on 'Larry King' and I'll say it to you: I don't take any of this seriously anymore. After you lose a daughter [Rich's daughter , Gabrielle, died of leukemia in 1996], none of this is important. The sight of a paparazzo tripping and falling as he chased after a celebrity would be enough to make many stars smile. Not Meg Ryan , who on Tuesday was nice enough to stop to look after the photographer who fell as he pursued her. Are you all right? she asked the man. I'm fine , he said. But I wouldn't have tripped if you had stopped to pose for a picture. Will you pose for me now? No , I still won't, said the actress , as she turned and got into a car waiting on E. 56th St. Ryan and her Kate and Leopold co-star , Hugh Jackman, had come to the new Hugo Boss store on Fifth Ave. for a performance by the Dan Band, whose lead singer, Dan Finnerty, is married to actress Kathy Najimy. Before the Ryan rumor mill spins out of control, let me also report that Ryan and Jackman were accompanied by his wife, Deborra-Lee Furness. Ryan, who dressed down for her night out, danced solo to the music and used a security guard to help shield her from reporters and photographers inside the event. Ironically, after her encounter with the fallen paparazzo, Ryan was soon surrounded by other photographers, who managed to get off a few shots. Others spotted at the party included John Ritter, Donald Trump and girlfriend Melania Knauss, Jamie-Lynn Sigler, actress Martha Plimpton and Hugo Boss CEO Marty Staff. A BIRTHDAY DO WITHOUT ADO Making a big to-do over birthdays becomes less of an issue with age. Just ask Mike Wallace, who turned 83 yesterday. The venerable 60 Minutes icon began his celebration on Tuesday with an intimate dinner at Guastavino's on E. 59th St. Included were Wallace; his son , NBC News correspondent Chris; his daughter, Pauline, and her husband. The foursome sat on a balcony overlooking the bar and didn't make a big fuss. In fact, they didn't even order a cake. Of course, with all they ate, the last thing they needed was cake. Try mousseline of spring peas with artichokes and capers, sweet shrimp with curry oil and celery leaves, risotto of Jersey asparagus and upstate ramps (wild leeks), roast duck with kumquats and Thai basil, Champagne granita with citrus supremes, and blueberry financier (a small, buttery sponge cake) with sour-cream ice cream. It's amazing that Wallace made it to 83 eating such rich food.  ",

   "input": "By Christopher Lehmann-Haupt OUTSIDE OVER THERE. By Maurice Sen- dak. Unpaginated. Harper & Row. $12.95. MAURICE SENDAK has illustrated more than six dozen children's books since his career began in 1947. Yet despite their consistent excellence and astonishing diversity, two among them, ''Where the Wild Things Are'' (1947) and ''In the Night Kitchen'' (1971), have stood out as career milestones and personal maps of where Mr. Sendak's imagination has been exploring. Now comes a third book, called ''Outside Over There.'' It has been five years in preparation and is as different from ''In the Night Kitchen'' as that work was different from ''Where the Wild Things Are.'' Yet it is intended to form a unit with the earlier two books, because, as Mr. Sendak observes in Selma G. Lanes's lavish and informative retrospective study, ''The Art of Maurice Sendak'' (published late last year by Harry N. Abrams, 278 pages, $40), ''They are all variations on the same theme: how children master various feelings - danger, boredom, fear, frustration, jealousy - and manage to come to grips with the realities of their lives.'' The text of ''Outside Over There'' -which recounts the kidnapping by five goblins of a baby girl and her rescue by her 9-year-old sister - is simplicity itself, even though, as Mr. Sendak also told Mrs. Lanes, he cares about the words of his books at least as much as he does about the illustrations and even though he revised the text of ''Outside'' more than 100 times: When Papa was away at sea, and Mama in the arbor, Ida played her wonder horn to rock the baby still - but never watched. So the goblins came. They pushed their way in and pulled baby out, leaving another all made of ice. But Mr. Sendak's illustrations are evocative in so many different ways that for a self-conscious adult mind to enter the world of ''Outside Over There'' is to risk becoming paralyzed by the book's allusiveness. It is easy enough to draw banal conclusions -that the style of the illustrations derives from the German 19th-century romantic tradition in which Mr. Sendak got interested when he did the pictures for an edition of the Grimm brothers' marchen, although the book also contains visual references to everything from high Renaissance art to Dali; or that the book is filled with personal data from the author's life, as well as numerous allusions to his previous work. The Sibling Question It is also obvious enough that its story is really about an older sister's ambivalent feelings toward a younger sibling, and about getting one's feelings under control and expressing them through functional rather than narcissistic love. (Before the kidnapping, which incidentally alludes in various ways to the Lindbergh baby and to the Dionne quintuplets, Ida's love is all empty gesture; after the rescue, her love is expressed by teaching the infant how to walk.) But what are we to make of some of the mystifying plot details? Why is it a ''serious mistake'' for Ida to have ''climbed backwards out her window into outside over there'' when she sets out to find her sister? Does her ''mistake'' lie in having climbed ''outside over there,'' a reference, in Mr. Sendak's personal scheme, to the fantasy worlds that lie beyond windows? Or is her error simply to have climbed out ''backwards''? Why, two illustrations later, does the figure of Ida floating over a Baroque landscape make an obvious visual pun on Bernini's ''St. Theresa in Ecstasy,'' except that instead of being transported by orgasmic bliss, Ida's face is transfixed with wide-eyed apprehension? Does her ''mistake'' have something to do with sex? If so, what? Probably such questions have no rational set of answers, yet each of them seems to open up a dozen more. Can ''Outside Over There'' really be a children's book, some readers must be wondering by now. If so, is it appropriate for a children's book to be raising such questions? Mr. Sendak would say that the audience for his work is irrelevant, because he strongly believes his books are for readers of all ages. And if you were to respond that it's one thing for adults to understand the sexual overtones of ''Outside Over There'' and quite another thing to expect children to do so, Mr. Sendak would reply, as he does in ''The Art of Maurice Sendak'' to a similar challenge: ''I think children read the internal meanings of everything. It's only adults who read the top layers most of the time.'' Relief and Renewal Though I'm inclined to agree, I can't account for a real child's reaction to ''Outside Over There.'' The best I can do is attest to the response of the somewhat withered child who survives inside of me - the child that Mr. Sendak is presumably trying to reach by communicating with the robust child that seems to survive inside of him. My child knows that Ida and her sister have endured some profoundly mysterious and threatening ordeal. And the experience of having come through this ordeal gives him a sense of relief and renewal. But my child is also bewildered by much of ''Outside Over There.'' There is a grandeur and complexity about the pictures that intimidate him. They lack the warmth and direct appeal of ''Where the Wild Things Are'' and ''In the Night Kitchen.'' They have a quality of nightmare. That is not necessarily a bad thing in a book such as this. In fact, it may be a very good thing. But so far, my child isn't absolutely certain.  ",

   "input": "HILO, Hawaii 2014 A small plane ran out of fuel and was ditched in the ocean several miles off Hawaii's coast, but the pilot was rescued by Coast Guard crews who had flown alongside and coached him on crash landing in the choppy seas. Dramatic video released by the Coast Guard shows the plane gliding low over the water and then splashing down. Within seconds the pilot climbs out onto a wing as a helicopter lowers a rescue swimmer, who helps him enter a basket so he can be hoisted to the hovering aircraft. Police identified the pilot as Charles Brian Mellor, of Puerto De Santa Maria, Spain. The 65-year-old, who was not seriously injured, was flying solo from Monterey, Calif., when he radioed authorities Friday afternoon that he was running low on fuel about 500 miles from his destination of Hilo, Hawaii, the Coast Guard said. The cities are about 2,300 miles apart. Mellor was taken to Hilo Medical Center, the Coast Guard said. A person answering the phone there, who declined to give her name, said Saturday that Mellor had been released. No additional details were available. The Coast Guard had sent a plane to rendezvous with Mellor's two-engine Cessna and dispatched a ship and helicopter to be ready for a possible rescue, spokesman Lt. Gene Maestas told The Associated Press. After meeting up with the plane over the Pacific, the Guard's HC-130 Hercules flew alongside for more than an hour, until the aircraft's fuel gave out and it went down 13 miles off Hawaii. We were communicating to him the entire time , Maestas said. The pilots were telling him how to make the airplane ready ... to lighten , tie things down, adjust the seat. Mellor was urged to go in at a low angle to the water and touch down parallel to the waves 2013 running at strong 6 feet 2013 rather than absorbing their power by plowing into them head-first. We basically talked him down , Maestas said. Mellor ditched his airplane about an hour before sundown. In the two-minute video apparently shot from another Coast Guard aircraft , the plane skims the water for a few seconds before coming to an abrupt stop and spinning around in the foaming seas. It floats upright with the pilot clinging to it but appears to begin sinking within a minute, as the Guard swimmer is lowered to waters near the plane. He was able to crawl out of cockpit and speak to the rescue swimmer; he didn't appear to have any significant injuries , Maestas said. The video shows the swimmer hanging onto the basket carrying Mellor as it moves upward , before the swimmer drops several feet back into the water. It ends with the helicopter carrying the pilot flying off. Maestas said the Cessna sank in just a few minutes. We feel very fortunate that we were able to save this man's life , he said.  ",

   "input": "WASHINGTON - The Securities and Exchange Commission is planning to hire an outside investigator to look into complaints about the agency 2019s internal watchdog unit after its top official stepped down amid complaints about his work. 201cAn individual has raised allegations of misconduct by former and current employees in the office of inspector general, 2019 2019 John Nester, an SEC spokesman, said Tuesday. 201cThe matter was promptly referred to the Council of Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency. We are also in the process of hiring an independent investigator to review the claims. 2019 2019 Nester did not say whom the agency would hire or specify the allegations and targets they would pursue. The SEC has not had a permanent inspector general since January when David Kotz resigned after four years in the post. Kotz was lauded by lawmakers for his scrutiny of SEC missteps in overseeing financial firms including Bear Stearns Cos. and Bernard Madoff Investment Securities while facing criticism from current and former employees over his pursuit of investigations that some said lacked evidence of wrongdoing and unfairly hurt workers 2019 reputations. His decision last year to refer former SEC general counsel David Becker to federal prosecutors for possible criminal ethics violations stemming from his work on policy related to Bernard Madoff 2019s Ponzi scheme helped spark the backlash. Becker, who inherited profits from his parents 2019 account with Madoff, was cleared by the Justice Department in November. Kotz 2019s contacts with Phillip Cannella, a financial adviser from the Philadelphia area who markets 201ccrash-proof 2019 2019 retirement plans, also have come under review. In late July, Kotz gave Cannella a 75-minute interview at the SEC 2019s Washington headquarters. The SEC has pressed unsuccessfully for Canella to remove video clips from the interview from his website, saying their use could imply that Kotz or the agency endorsed his business. Kotz confirmed to Bloomberg News in December that after the interview Cannella got him three club-level tickets for a sold-out football game between the Philadelphia Eagles and New York Giants. He reimbursed Canella $95 per ticket; the Eagles valued them at $240 each. The former SEC watchdog, who is now a managing director at Gryphon Strategies in Washington, declined to comment Monday on the outside investigation. Senator Charles Grassley, Republican of Iowa, who defended Kotz during his time at the SEC, questioned whether the agency should pursue an investigation. 201cI know from prior experience that outside investigators can get very expensive for taxpayers, 2019 2019 Grassley said in an e-mail Monday. 201cThere are governmental structures in place to investigate allegations against an inspector general. I intend to find out more from the SEC about the allegations and the rationale for hiring an outside investigator. 2019 2019 A spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation did not respond to a telephone call after normal business hours.

Upward of 100 chefs and 1,000-plus in serving staff will be working around the clock to prepare this Super Bowl-sized feast. Luckily for fans, the menu isn't exclusive to only box and premium seating. Our philosophy on the Super Bowl menu is that the 'special' menu items shouldn 2019t be limited to just one group of fans , so we 2019ve made sure that our Cajun classics are available to everyone, said John Hickman , communications director for Centerplate. The culinary talent behind the cuisine is James Beard Award-winning chef and NOLA legend Donald Link. The Louisiana native chef began cooking at the age of 15, and has since opened five restaurants in New Orleans' Warehouse District, including Herbsaint, Cochon, Cochon Butcher, Calcasieu, and Cochon Lafayette. No one throws a party quite like New Orleans , Link explains , and I think we perfectly captured the city's flavor and flair in our menu. Menu items include alligator chili , with alligator sausage from Crescent City Meats, a local NOLA purveyor; a Roast Beef Debris Po'Boy, with rolls from 100-plus-year-old Leidenheimer bakery in New Orleans; BBQ shrimp and grits, with fresh Louisiana Gulf Coast-caught white shrimp; chicken and sausage gumbo, with dark roux, chicken, and sausage in a flavorful broth served with white rice; Natchitoches crawfish pies, Louisiana fried pies with zesty dressing crawfish stuffing; chef Donald Links' chicken sauce piquant (Links' take on the traditional Cajun recipe); and Bayou Bootleg, a drink with the taste of the South and a splash of raspberry, the special Craft Cocktail for this year 2019s Super Bowl. The Gulf Shrimp Cocktail will ring in as most expensive item for the day , set at a whopping $30 an order. On the other end of the spectrum, a small order of nachos will ring up as the least expensive, at just $8. Some local food partners for the day's offerings include Leidenheimer Bakery, a New Orleans staple since 1896, famous in the area for their French bread and time-honored process; Haydel's Bakery, a three-generation New Orleans, family-owned and run bakery that prides themselves on their cookies, cakes, and pastries; Crescent City Meats, another three-generation NOLA presence, with all products naturally slow smoked with hickory; and The Louisiana Seafood Promotion and Marketing Board, the number one provider of shrimp, oyster, crab, crawfish, and alligator in the country. Coaches and chefs alike take weeks to prepare for this big night. The culinary game plan includes churning out 10,000 pounds of Gulf shrimp, 700 gallons of traditional Cajun gumbo,3,000 pounds of alligator sausage, 450 gallons of New Orleans red beans (to be served with 6,000 pounds of rice), 150 gallons of spinach and artichoke dip,18,000 pounds of pork (smoked on-site, mind you), and 1, 200 gallons of Link's signature chicken piquant. From chef-inspired cuisine to creative cocktails , our goal is to make every sporting event an incredible experience for fans, but for the Super Bowl, we know how to take football food to the next level, says Centerplate CEO Des Hague. Whether your team wins or loses , we bet that everybody will walk away satisfied with Centerplate's culinary experience on Feb. 3.

   "input": "I arrived at a point in my mind, David Holthouse says , where it seemed to me that murder was entirely rational , justifiable and even a morally responsible course of action. Holthouse's 25-year path to revenge began in Anchorage , Alaska, in 1978, at the home of his parents' best friends. The friends' son was 10 years older than Holthouse, and was the quarterback for the high school football team. Holthouse admired him. But one night, the high school quarterback lured the 7-year-old downstairs to play and trapped him in a corner. The older boy forced a terrified Holthouse to stimulate him orally. Then I remember being face down on his waterbed with a pillow over my head , Holthouse says. I had no concept of sex or rape or anything like that. I just knew that it hurt like hell. Once the teen had finished violating Holthouse , he ordered him never to tell anyone what had happened. Holthouse grew up to become a journalist; his career took him from Alaska to Arizona to Colorado. Then one night, his parents called with a remarkable coincidence to report. Their best friends' son was also living in the Denver area. The knowledge tormented Holthouse. Memories of his violation flooded back. And I just fixated on it , he says , and fixated on a desire to kill him. And so , using the skills he employed in reporting one of his stories, Holthouse carefully, incessantly plotted his revenge. Once I decided I was going to kill him , I felt a lot calmer about things, Holthouse says. I was convinced that I was not his only victim and that in all likelihood , he was still raping kids. And therefore it was crucial for me to wipe him off the face of the earth. That's what I told myself. That's how I justified it. I think that really , I just wanted to shoot him. But before Holthouse could take action while his mother was cleaning out his old bedroom in Alaska , something caught her eye. It was a long-forgotten childhood diary -- Holthouse's diary -- in which he'd confided what had happened to him. Horrified, his mother fired off a brutally frank message to the man's parents. She says she told them that , um, that their son had raped my son when he was 7. And once my parents told me that , I knew that there was no way I could go ahead with my plans to kill him, says Holthouse. Then Holthouse thought of another way he could get revenge. He decided to write about being raped and about his plan for vengeance. He knew that meant confronting the man at last. When the two met , Holthouse's hidden tape recorder captured the man's voice. It happened one time I don't know why It never happened since , it never happened before, he told Holthouse. I guess my main concern is that you're okay I'm never going to be able to apologize to you enough. Those words led to another momentous decision: Holthouse decided not to name the man in his story. The story set off a firestorm of reaction from readers. Person after person after person saying , this happened to me too, this happened to me too, when I was a kid.  ",

   "input": "Detail from Mars and Rhea Silvia, by Peter Paul Rubens, which is on show at the Palais Lumi 00e8re. Photograph: Collections Princi 00e8res du Liechtenstein, Vaduz-Wien Collecting can be a transmissible disease. In the Liechtenstein royal family the affection goes back to their ancestor Hartmann von Liechtenstein (1544-85). The principality, known for its welcoming banks, was only established in 1719, though the princes actually went on living in Vienna and buying lots of paintings, as well as many other items, on show at the Liechtenstein museum in Vienna. The Palais Lumi 00e8re in Evian, on the shores of Lake Geneva, is exhibiting an impressive selection of works from the collection with 70 paintings, 20 sculptures and 15 pieces of furniture. We lingered for a moment in front of a copy by Brueghel the Younger of one of his father's most famous paintings, Census at Bethlehem, in which the Virgin Mary on her ass and Joseph, bearing his saw, arrive in a snow-covered village in Flanders, then stopped to admire Mars and Rhea Silvia by Peter Paul Rubens. It brims over with energy and colour, Mars's red mantle swelling with erotic fury in response to the folded, yellow robes of the vestal virgin, surprised in her sleep. Another Rubens followed, featuring a suitably horned satyr holding a basket of fruit, which suggests that the Liechtensteins had the same saucy taste as their Habsburg sovereigns. But a third piece, The Lamentation of Christ, tempered our suspicions. The Liechtensteins take pride in their forebears, giving rise to a gallery of portraits. We were struck by Joseph Wenzel I von Liechtenstein, who having been inducted into the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1740 decided to commission a work by Hyacinthe Rigaud, then the most fashionable portraitist in Paris. The profusion of drapes tend to conceal the princely figure, but he was apparently so pleased with the result that, in addition to his fee, he gave the painter a diamond-incrusted gold snuffbox. In another register we were moved by the face of Marie Franziska von Liechtenstein, painted a century later, clasping her doll as she slept. She was only two when Friedrich von Amerling did this portrait. The Liechtenstein collection also includes humble, anonymous figures, some painted by Frans Hals. His Portrait of a Man is a masterpiece, a symphony of blacks and greys. At another level the exhibition's curators, the head of the Liechtenstein Museum in Vienna Johann Kr 00e4ftner and art historian Caroline Messensee, offer a glimpse of the changing tastes of a central European royal family over a period of almost 500 years.

   "input": "Since Tate Modern opened further down the banks of the Thames in the millennium year, its senior partner, Tate Britain, has been rather overshadowed by the young upstart's skyrocket success 2013 at one point the most successful public gallery in the world.. By comparison Tate Britain looked dusty and lost, its layout confusing, its galleries and public spaces under layers of alterations and paint, and its dingy subterraneancafe worthy of an eastern bloc works canteen. Now, Tate Britain is set to reopen after a major 00a345m revamp. The work, by architects Caruso St John, has transformed the riverside part of the building once so despised, according to Tate director Sir Nicholas Serota said there was a serious proposal in the 1960s to demolish the lot and build a smart modernist block. When the Tate originally opened in 1897, it was such a success that within six months the National Gallery was holding anxious meetings to discuss its falling visitor numbers, Serota said. From the start, however, it needed to grow. It opened with architects' drawings on the walls showing the proposed next set of new galleries, and has been continuously altered and extended, often for the worse, ever since. The latest revamp has been paid for by a major Heritage Lottery Fund grant and scores of donations from trusts, private donors, and members of the public 2013 an effort that Tate chairman Lord Browne described as a model of how to achieve major projects through philanthropic giving. Now light pours down from the new second floor high up in the dome, through a spectacular spiral staircase punched through the floor of the rotunda into the underworld, once a swamp and then the infamous Millbank penitentiary 2013 the last stop in England for thousands of transported prisoners. All the national collections are courting subscription-paying 'friends' with renewed fervour as government funding is steadily cut. Their beautiful new space at Tate Britain had been carved up into offices and meeting rooms since staff were driven out of the cellar offices in 1928 by a disastrous flood. The cafe has been transformed with new windows provinging light and ventilation, and is now home to the subtlest of the new artworks incorporated in the building, a graphite drawing by Alan Johnson just deepening the shadow of the ceiling arches. The famous restaurant, dubbed the most amusing room in Europe , is polishing the wine glasses ready for its reopeningand will now feature locally sourced produce, although Camberwell artichokes and Epping butter 2013 both renowned when it first opened 2013 are trickier these days. It will be just the same , but better, Tate Britain director Penelope Curtis promised. There is a still work to do , including replacing the near defunct air conditioning in the south-west corner of the building, but Curtis said: We're going to take a little break now , the public has been very patient with us. One of the hidden glories of the building has been swept away in the work: the bath in the director's office , which was part of the partitioned and now restored Grand Saloon. Shockingly, this national treasure has not even been preserved among the million objects in the archives. Serota, who once used the bath when he returned on an overnight flight from Los Angeles and had to go straight to a trustees' meeting, looked slightly troubled. It wasn't actually avocado , but it was of that vintage - it was no great beauty, I assure you.  ",

   "input": "In 1977, Toby Mott celebrated his 14th birthday in the Roxy in Covent Garden, London's now legendary punk club. He remembers loud pounding darkness , cheap lager, the smell of cigarettes, sweat and piss 2026 a few floors almost empty, like a kind of youth club. Back then , he belonged to a gang of kids from Pimlico comprehensive that called themselves the ASA (Anarchist Street Army) and hung out daily in an independent record shop on nearby Wilton Road called Recordsville. There, he started buying seven-inch singles by the punk vanguard: In the City by the Jam , New Rose by the Damned , White Riot by the Clash , Oh Bondage , Up Yours by X-Ray Spex. There , too, he discovered the dubious delights of several second-division punk groups that have long since faded into obscurity, the likes of the Boys, the Cortinas, Eater, Headache, Slaughter and the Dogs, the Snivelling Shits 2026 Mott also started collecting fanzines, flyers and posters. I'd go around to Recordsville when they were putting up new posters and nab the ones that had just been taken down. I'd go to Rough Trade or Beaufort Market in Chelsea and pick up flyers for gigs. Most of it was produced in such relatively small quantities for these specialist record shops. I knew , even then, that they had a certain value. They helped make you a serious punk. Mott , who is now an artist and curator, has been collecting punk ephemera ever since, watching its value grow in the three decades since. An exhibition of his British punk paraphernalia, Loud Flash, opens at the Haunch of Venison gallery in London next month. It will also feature often inflammatory political ephemera from the time, including National Front recruitment posters that show just how much the extreme right, as well as the radical left, utilised punk graphics and imagery in their attempts to attract Britain's disenfranchised youth. You could go to certain punk gigs , Sham 69, say, and were just as likely to be handed a National Front leaflet as an Anti-Nazi League one. It was a very aggressive and polarised political time, as well as a cultural one. Those ideas of the extreme were always in the room. Mott thinks that punk has been misrepresented since , both by rock historians who have over-intellectualised its meaning and context, and by curators who over-emphasise its artistic links to previous avant-gardes. Ironically, the academic essays that accompany the exhibition fall into the same trap, calling up the Bauhaus, the Futurists, the Situationists, as well as Andy Warhol. Punk was what it was , says Mott. It doesn't need all that. Jamie Reid , who created the Sex Pistols' posters, came from a radical 60s art-school background, and knew the history of disruptive art movements, but mostly it was kids in suburban bedrooms and garages with scissors, paste and photocopiers. The graphics sprang from the same place as the music, the do-it-yourself-and-do-it-now attitude that underpinned punk. It was an incredibly proactive time, the opposite of today's consumer-led pop culture. Everything was fast, aggressive, disposable, a furious outburst against the boredom of life in 70s Britain. Mott's collection contains several rare Jamie Reid works , including a poster entitled Never Mind the Bans , advertising the Sex Pistols' troubled British tour in 1977, when the group's notoriety was such that several town councils banned them from performing. There is work, too, by the artist Linder Sterling, who created the iconic artwork for the Buzzcocks' single Orgasm Addict , and posters utilising the images of established music photographers like Pennie Smith and Kate Simon, both of whom helped create the outlaw mythology of the Clash. What interests Mott most about his own collection, though, are what he calls the anonymous artefacts produced in small numbers by fired-up teenagers. To this end , he has included crudely made Xeroxed fanzines like Sniffin' Glue, Alternative Ulster, Ripped & Torn, London's Burning and the wonderfully named Chelmsford's Dead. In a way , these are artefacts left over from a dead culture, says Mott , but they speak more powerfully about what punk was really about , that moment of momentum and self-empowerment. It was not about making a profit or building a fucking brand. It seems odd now that the establishment were so threatened by it, but they were. You can't imagine a pop group today being a threat to the nation. Back then, we thought we were all about the future, but punk really was the last gasp of postwar radical culture.

   "input": "Peter Saville is, he says, an extremely busy man. At 57, he is about to be awarded the prestigious London Design medal, recognition of his status as the UK's most famous graphic designer. The award brings with it a lot of attention 2013 I thought they were just going to give me a medal , he sighs. He is also flying to New York for a Yohji Yamamoto show on which he has collaborated , despite his open contempt for contemporary fashion. He has emblazoned the collection with the words Meaningless excitement and For further advice please contact our fashion advisors. Saville says Yamamoto didn't even flinch at what he calls his slightly facetious stance. To hear a man who has been so heavily involved in the industry 2013 as well as Yamamoto , he has worked with Jil Sander, John Galliano, Christian Dior, Stella McCartney, Raf Simons and Kate Moss 2013 claim the whole business is an exercise in mass mind control and triviality that enslaves people to consumption comes as a shock. Yet it is virtually the first thing Saville says to me when I walk into his studio home in Clerkenwell , London. It is not as if this is a great revelation, the cry of a man gradually disillusioned by life amid the rag trade's ugly swirl, he points out. Earlier this year he was asked to come up with a design to celebrate Lacoste's 80th birthday. They said: 'Do anything you want , but don't touch the crocodile logo.' So that's what I did: destroyed the crocodile. Digitally shattered it in 80 different ways. He shows me the resulting shirts. A completely fucked crocodile , he laughs. I felt I had to do it because of this sort of brand obsession. People talk about brands and it's awful. You can sell anything with a logo on. That needed to be questioned. The stuff about fashion turns out to be a characteristic Saville answer. It is both extremely long and a little contradictory. He may be celebrated for his work , but he claims he never really wanted to be a graphic designer in the first place, and in any case has sort of retired or disengaged from the job , apparently mortified by its commercial aspects. I remember sitting in a meeting and there was an impasse , and the man at the head of the table said: 'Relax, we're all just here to make money.' Actually, I'm not here to make money. I'm here to try and make something better. The idea that people are only doing things to make money, and actually there are no values in it whatsoever, will adopt whatever position is necessary for that goal, that has nothing to do with what I ever did. Given a retrospective show at the Design Museum in 2003 , Saville says, he put a piece on the wall that said: 'Be careful what you wish for' and closed his studio. I'm not running an agency , he says. I don't have an agent , I'm not actually looking for work although I need to do a bit, because it's expensive and difficult being on the ground in London. Retired or not , in 2013, his name is pretty much the only one in the field that might spark a flicker of recognition in someone who does not have membership of the Design Museum and an ongoing subscription to Creative Review. Yet the designs on which Saville's reputation rests are all between 25 and 35 years old: the diagram of a pulsar's radio waves on the cover of Joy Division's Unknown Pleasures and the stark photos of tombs on their album Closer and the single Love Will Tear Us Apart, that seemed to take on an eerie, precognitive power after the suicide of singer Ian Curtis; the die-cut replica of a floppy disc and the reappropriation of Henri Fantin-Latour's A Basket Of Roses that housed New Order's Power, Corruption and Lies. Furthermore, they are all record sleeves, a dead art that he says he had no interest in pursuing after the age of 30. He is clearly enormously proud of his work in recent years as creative director to the city council of Manchester , his hometown. His explanation of what the job entailed is an epic, even by his standards 2013 a fascinating and rather beautiful stream of tangential ideas that variously takes in the condition of the post-industrial city, how bankruptcy can turn your value system upside down, the difference between a waste of time and an abuse of time, Professor Brian Cox, the Manchester Art Treasures exhibition of 1857, how London isn't really the capital of Britain any more but an independent city state , and the Labour MP and historian Tristram Hunt. Alas, at the end of it, I have no idea of what he has actually done, beyond attending a lot of meetings and coming up with the phrase Original Modern , which he apparently refused to allow the city to use as a slogan. The council ended his contract in 2011 and, with the best will in the world, you can see why. It is all rather confusing, although in fairness, Saville seems as bewildered as I am. He's arrived at the interview with a series of handwritten notes, which seem to represent a concerted effort on his part to work out what he is, or thinks he is, or wants to be: despite referring to them, he keeps laughingly sinking his head into his hands as we talk. His problems really began the moment he approached Tony Wilson at a Patti Smith gig in 1978, he says. Wilson was in the process of starting Factory Records, and Saville had been intrigued by record sleeves since buying the British edition of Kraftwerk's Autobahn. Factory spoilt him, he says. It wasn't a company , it was an autonomous opportunity that just occurred for us in Manchester, manifested by Tony. He had a job in broadcasting, so he didn't need to make any money. It was what you'd call a folly, a collection of individuals doing exactly what they felt. No one was answerable to anyone. The bands never told him what to design , he says. Joy Division were too busy trying to work out how to play their instruments, and when they regrouped after Curtis's death, New Order were too busy arguing with each other. I was left to my own devices and it turned out that I had my own agenda. In no other circumstances would that happen. If I'd gone into any other kind of design practice , forget it. It left him hopelessly underprepared for the realities of life outside the Factory gates , so to speak, a state of affairs not helped by the fact that he appeared to inherit not just Wilson's idealism, but his legendarily appalling business sense. In 1986, Saville could command 00a320,000 to design an album sleeve for Peter Gabriel, but three years later he was virtually bankrupt. An attempt to join a more standard graphic design agency went as you might expect, given Saville's aversion to commerce and being told what to do and, indeed, deadlines. An attempt to start a multimedia practice in Los Angeles in 1993 was even less successful: he left after a couple of months. He found himself broke, reduced to visiting record labels in the hope that they would give him free albums he could sell at a secondhand store. I had $3 the day of the big earthquake in LA in 1994. Literally. That was new for me , from an affluent, spoilt, middle-class background. I needed $20 each day to drive the car 2013 because there's driving to do in LA 2013 and to eat. And it's very difficult when you need $20. People who were 2013 he makes air quotes 2013 friends would make you wait all day for $20. It was probably good for me. Find out what it means to have no money. Eventually , he made it back to Britain, convinced he was the last big thing , only to discover that, amid the climate of reverence for the past engendered by Britpop, he was once more in demand not just by bands including Suede and Pulp, but by the fashion industry. He should have ascended with ease to the role of the grand old 2013 or at least middle-aged 2013 man of British graphic design. His early designs have worked their way into the fabric of British life 2013 in 2010, the cover of Power, Corruption and Lies made its way on to a first-class stamp. But he seems surprisingly equivocal about their iconic status, concerned that they have become divorced from their original meaning, from the authenticity of Factory: You see them used to sell Airmiles or text message minutes. He mentions the total car crash catalogue of disasters that was Disney's attempt to market a T-shirt with Joy Division's Unknown Pleasures cover turned into Mickey Mouse's head. He shows me a T-shirt featuring the same image , with the slogan: WHAT IS THIS? I SAW IT ON TUMBLR. It's brilliant , isn't it? he says , smiling. Profoundly clever. For all Saville's contradictions and professed difficulties , I am not convinced that he isn't secretly happy in what he describes as the interzone between things , blessed with a reputation that enables him to ignore briefs and cause trouble. He gives the impression that he rather enjoys it. Just before I leave, he tells me about his 2010 commission to redesign the England football shirt: he came up with the idea of multicoloured crosses of St George. The red and white thing has been entirely marginalised by one kind of person. It's synonymous with an attitude that is naive , xenophobic, bullying and self-marginalising. I thought, that's not reflective of the team, or football, or of the nation at all. But it turns out the market for those shirts are those bloody-minded xenophobic individuals with the shaved heads. When it came out, they did not like it. They did not like it at all. He laughs in manner that doesn't sound rueful or abashed so much as delighted. Oh yeah , he nods , still laughing, they fucking hated it. Peter Saville will be in conversation with Paul Morley at the Global Design Forum on 16 September , as part of the London Design Festival, 14 201322 September. www.londondesignfestival.com  ",

It goes something like this: Revealed as a patent copycat last summer by a California jury 2019s $1.05 billion verdict 2014 a PR disaster of the first order that shook top management and tarnished the image of an entire nation 2014 Samsung quietly declared war on Apple. Drawing on a massive $5.3 billion sales, promotion and marketing budget, the company poured a fortune into a high-profile ad campaign designed to caricature Apple 2019s customers as foolish sheep. Meanwhile at the retail level it paid mobile phone salespeople cash 201cspiffs 201d (bonuses) for every smartphone customer they could persuade to choose Samsung over Apple. Behind the scenes, the company engaged in more surreptitious stratagems. It began paying students and other heavy users of social media to post anonymous messages talking up the virtues of Samsung 2019s products and spreading fear, uncertainty and doubt about Apple and other competitors. Most deviously of all, it took a massive short position in Apple in the U.S. securities markets, putting selling pressure on the stock and tarnishing Apple 2019s once-glowing reputation on Wall Street. OK, so that last bit is admittedly a stretch and purely speculative. Apple 2019s shares were due to fall of their weight as the company entered several quarters of tighter margins and slower growth. But the rest of this nightmare fantasy is pretty well-documented fact. The shocked reaction of Chairman Lee Kun-hee to the California verdict last summer was widely reported in South Korean media. Samsung 2019s marketing budget comes directly from the company 2019s quarterly reports. The anti-Apple ads were aired on prime-time American television. Some of Samsung 2019s spiff rates are posted online. And just this week Samsung 2019s Taiwanese subsidiary admitted that it paid students to post negative comments about rival HTC in its home market. Reports have since surfaced in the U.K. and Sweden that it was engaging in similar practices in those countries. To be fair, Samsung is a world-class electronics manufacturer and a fierce competitor whose smartphones have steadily improved and increased market share on their own merit. But the company certainly has pockets deep enough to do real damage to a company it might choose to target by other means. What 2019s not clear is how low it 2019s been willing to go.  ",

   "input": "Among the greatest blessings of rising global prosperity is better nutrition for billions of people, but with a catch: the challenge of sustainably producing the extra food that increasing numbers can finally afford. It 2019s a giant opportunity for the world 2019s largest manufacturer of agricultural equipment, Deere DE . To grab it, CEO Sam Allen,60, travels often to Brazil, China, India, Russia, and other populous, growing countries. A Purdue grad who joined Deere in 1975, he became chief executive in 2009. The stock has about doubled since then, beating the S&P SPX . Allen spoke recently with Geoff Colvin about why Deere prefers that tractor drivers keep their hands off the steering wheel, about grooming young talent, and much else. Edited excerpts: Q: Global agricultural output will have to double in the next 40 years with no more land or water than we 2019ve got now. How 2019s that going to happen? A: We think there 2019s about 17% more arable land available in places like sub-Saharan Africa, the Cerrado areas of Brazil, the CIS [former Soviet republics]. But still it 2019s just a small part. Already 67% of the world 2019s fresh water is consumed by agriculture. We can 2019t just say, 201cDon 2019t irrigate. 201d We believe the key will be continuing to improve productivity, mostly on existing land. That 2019s going to come through a combination of seed genetics and smarter agronomic decisions, and those decisions are going to be enabled through the use of data coming off equipment that 2019s getting more intelligent all the time. How precise is agriculture getting? On our equipment 2014 large combines, large tractors, large sprayers 2014 we have proprietary GPS that enables what we call auto-steer. We don 2019t even want the operator to touch the steering wheel. Going up and down a field a mile each way, if the farmer has a 60-foot boom on the back, 30 feet on each side, there 2019ll be only a two-inch overlap. Prior to this, a farmer would have overlapped by at least six feet. Technologically, where are Deere 2019s greatest opportunities now? The greatest opportunities will always be around our big, highly productive equipment, whether it 2019s construction equipment or forestry equipment or large ag. In the case of large ag, it will be about enabling tractors and combines and sprayers to work smarter, faster. What is really interesting now is what we call smart implements. In baling straw, for example, there 2019s an optimum moisture content, and as the straw 2019s moisture content changes, you want the bale to be denser or less dense, which means you want the tractor to go faster or not as fast. We 2019ve just introduced a baler that has sensors on it that are sensing the moisture. The operator in the tractor does not touch anything, and the baler sends a signal to the tractor to go faster or slower. Deere is becoming more of an infotech business. Does that change the way you manage it? Most people don 2019t realize that one of our 8000 Series tractors has more computing power on it than the first space shuttle. We have reorganized so we can have a group that does what we 2019ve traditionally done well, which is the hardware and the embedded software that goes with it, and another group, where I 2019ve brought in people from places like Microsoft MSFT to help us with the application side of this. How would you advise a young person today who wanted to rise to the top of a big global company like yours? Focus on understanding what you don 2019t know, because if you don 2019t, some people in your organization will probably let you go ahead and go down that path, and you 2019re going to be in trouble. You 2019ve got to build relationships with people 2014 that 2019s critical 2014 but then you 2019ve got to say, 201cOkay, I do understand this, but I really don 2019t understand that, and I 2019ve got to let people know that and have people help me. 201d Water is fast becoming one of the most valuable commodities on earth. Can the technology help conserve water? Yes. A number of people are going more and more to no-till [farming]. And with no-till, you conserve water since you 2019re not busting up the ground. We do have an operation in precision-drip irrigation. It 2019s much, much more efficient than what 2019s done in a majority of the world today, which is just flood irrigation. You 2019ve got a great window into other important parts of the global economy. You have this big construction-equipment business, for starters, that gives you an opinion on housing starts in the U.S. It 2019s starting to improve a little. A normal year in new-housing starts is 1.6 million, 1.4 to 1.6 million. We were in excess of 2 million right before the Great Recession. We went down under 600,000. We 2019re back up in the 840,000 to 880,000 range. And we 2019re thinking that it 2019s not going to come back quite as quickly as some people might think. With a 2% GDP growth, you 2019re just not going to see things turn around overnight. Agriculture worldwide is a high-growth business for as far as the eye can see. It will attract a lot of competitors. Ultimately what is the source of Deere 2019s competitive advantage? I 2019d like to say part of it is our 176-year history, and some people would also say that can be an Achilles 2019 heel. But I do think our values keep us well grounded. Clearly one of our competitive advantages is our great dealer network. And we 2019re really good at developing strong dealers. It 2019s a source of sustainable competitive advantage. And then we do a really good job focusing on productivity, up time, and low total cost of ownership. That 2019s our value proposition to the customer. And we try not to deviate from that. We invest a lot of money in R&D. We 2019re about $1.5 billion a year right now. We invest a lot of money in new product programs, a lot of them now tied to emissions. But those are what I call bookends. In the middle it 2019s about having a very highly aligned, highly engaged, committed workforce 2014 that 2019s the 176-year part. That 2019s the culture that 2019s Deere, founded in integrity, commitment to quality. It brings that type of person into our organization. Highly aligned, highly engaged people are our major advantage. One of your stated priorities is growing talent in the company. How do you persuade the best young people to come to work for Deere? We 2019ve tried to really articulate our higher purpose 2014 we 2019re committed to those linked to the land, enabling human flourishing by letting farmers do a better job feeding the world, letting contractors do a better job sheltering the world. Probably right now, more than at any time in my career, that message really resonates with today 2019s kids who are coming out of school. So No. 1, you 2019ve got to have the type of company that somebody wants to come to. Then when we have a new group come in and I speak to them, I say, 201cOne of the first things I want you to do is really get to know us quickly. And if you don 2019t think you like us, leave, because it won 2019t be the type of company you want to work for. And we want people that really want to work for us. And the good news is if we keep you the first year, we have no turnover after that. 201d I think the other thing that has really helped us now is being global. It 2019s an opportunity to get talent from all around the world. And when you start going to the Indias and the Chinas of the world and talk about working for a multinational and talk about working in agriculture, you 2019ve got a great chance to attract talent. You went to college on what 2019s called an Evans scholarship, which goes to caddies. And I know that you have been a great supporter of this whole concept. How was it important to you? Evans scholars have to have economic need, so you come from middle income or lower, and then you have to have good academics. And then you have to caddy for at least two to three years at a minimum, a certain number of loops. And I had grown up around golf all my life, so that part was the easy part. A second thing is you end up, you 2019re in a house together, and there are about 46, 48 of us at the time I was there. And you don 2019t get to choose the house you 2019re in, and you don 2019t get to choose who you 2019re with. And so there were people from inner Chicago and a number of different backgrounds. Probably one of the great things for me in that was in building an appreciation for inclusion.

   "input": "Editor 2019s note: Every Sunday, Fortune publishes a favorite story from our magazine archives. This week, we look back at the wild and wooly tale of billionaire J.R. Simplot and the Idaho chip manufacturer he backed, Micron Technology. Micron 2019s CEO Steve Appleton died when a small plane he was piloting crashed earlier this month in Boise. Fortune Managing Editor Andy Serwer wrote the piece in late 1995 and he remembers that Appleton, then 35, seemed to have a need for speed. A picture in the article shows Appleton without a helmet making a jump on a dirt bike. Appleton 2019s tragic death is a sad chapter in Micron 2019s incredibly cinematic story. Micron Technology is one of the Big Board 2019s most active stocks. Behind it is the most active octogenarian spud farmer in Idaho. FORTUNE 2014 The cream-colored Lincoln eases down a dirt road along an Idaho feedlot. Cowboys spot the car 2019s MR. SPUD license plates and yank the reins of their horses to stare. At the wheel is their boss, John Richard (J.R.) Simplot, the remarkably vital 86-year-old billionaire. The old man stares right back at the cowpokes and nods with approval. Why shouldn 2019t he like what he sees? He owns everything in sight: the Bunyanesque feedlot, the huge complex of potato-processing plants, and, beyond, miles and miles of farmland. 201cIt 2019s a big moose, 201d he says. 201cAwesome. 201d As with any megafortune, Simplot 2019s wealth was built from a few simple but revolutionary ideas, much sweat, and a generous glossing of luck. The details of his experience, however, are singular in the extreme. To begin with, Simplot is really the last man to have hewed a great fortune from the preindustrial West: Starting in the 1920s in southern Idaho 2019s Snake River basin, he built a potato-based agricultural empire that, among other things, supplies McDonald 2019s with more than 50% of its French fries. Now, amazingly, he is emerging as one of the single biggest winners in semiconductor technology. Through mind-boggling gains in the stock of Micron Technology, his high-tech fortune has suddenly ballooned to the point where it is clearly exceeded only by Bill Gates 2019 and Paul Allen 2019s. Besides being a wild ride full of bigger-than-the-sky personalities, intrigue, and potfuls of instant money, his life begins to look like a metaphor for the history of American business in this century-a man makes a fortune practically in the era of Manifest Destiny and then makes another in the age of the Internet. It seems impossible. But it 2019s true. Simplot 2019s stake in Micron, the Boise chipmaker, has grown more than $2.5 billion, to $3.4 billion, in 24 months. That 2019s $5 million every working day. You may have noticed Micron on your newspaper 2019s business pages. Its stock nearly always on the NYSE most active list-in fact, only Teletonos de Mexico, Ford, and Compaq have had more shares change hands this year than Micron. Depending on the vagaries of the equity markets 2013and lately Micron and other tech stocks have fallen somewhat 2013the value of the 21% of Micron that Simplot owns or controls is on par with the stockholdings of Intel 2019s Gordon Moore, Oracle 2019s Larry Ellison, or H-P 2019s David Packard and William Hewlett. Unlike those men, though, Simplot never finished the eighth grade, and he accumulated half his fortune after the age of 84. (Actually, his Micron stock would be worth over $4 billion except that the company 2019s shares are down 25% since September. But, hey, they 2019re up more than sevenfold since November 1993.) Like most overnight success stories, Micron 2019s took years of toil, blind faith, and, for a long while, good money after bad. Simplot was there almost from the beginning. He didn 2019t just sneak in two years ago for the joy ride, nor was he some passive Dutch uncle. He bankrolled Micron, propped up the company when it was on the brink, and helped push it over the top. Today, Micron is a major provider of chips to Compaq and other PC makers. It 2019s also incredibly profitable. There is bickering in Boise over who really deserves credit for the success of the memory chip manufacturer. Simplot, of course, wasn 2019t the technical brains, nor was he the day-to-day CEO. But he was the sugar daddy. 201cFella, 201d Simplot says, 201cMicron is my baby. 201d Simple words, but perhaps irksome to one of the company 2019s founders and a former CEO, Joe Parkinson, who clashed with Simplot over financial and fiduciary matters at Micron. These differences came to a head last year, FORTUNE has learned, after the CEO and Simplot locked horns over whether Simplot was divulging what Parkinson considered inside information. Parkinson asked Simplot to cease. He also made a motion that Simplot be removed from the board. When Simplot said Parkinson 2019s charges were groundless and didn 2019t step down, Parkinson resigned. Micron apparently felt no ill effects. The board installed as CEO a then 34-yearold named Steven Appleton, who had started out working in the company 2019s clean rooms at $4.46 an hour. Micron 2019s boom has benefited Boise tremendously. In fact, you could say this town of 347,773 is in the midst of a Chip Rush. Boise is now the fifth-fastest-growing city in the U.S., thanks largely to Micron and no thanks to other local businesses, like Morrison Knudsen, which has imploded, and a Hewlett-Packard disk-drive and printer plant that has cut its work force. Micron has created 8,000 jobs and dozens of millionaires, and upon a lucky few has bestowed truly huge fortunes. The latter group includes members of Micron 2019s board, ranchers, farmers, and developers- friends of Simplot 2019s. They are powerful landowners 2013the state 2019s elite who each now happen to own $50 million to $100 million of Micron stock. Some mornings you can find them at Burns Bros. truck stop off Interstate 84 having breakfast at 6 A.M. Last one in gets stuck with the tab. And Simplot is their aged king. Up in the private card room of the Arid Club 2013where none of the new women members dare tread 2014J.R., or Jack, as they sometimes call him, holds court. Every afternoon he drives his Lincoln five blocks over from his office in downtown Boise, parks in the handicapped spot out front ( 201cNo cripples here anyway 201d), and unlocks a special door that leads directly upstairs. 201cHey, boys, 201d he says, walking in, a little stiffly now after his second hip replacement surgery last April. 201cHow about a game? 201d And the boys oblige, gin rummy or bridge, for a couple of hours. At an age when most of us would be thrilled to push a shuffleboard stick, Simplot is the 00e9minence grise behind his private Simplot Co. 2013which has potato, ranching, chemical, and mineral interests 2013as well as Micron. Both do close to $3 billion in annual sales. Yes, his hearing and memory are diminished 2013he 2019s not great on the phone. Yes, his driving is a little shaky 2013he parks wherever he chooses, which drives truckers at his plants crazy. And, yes, he looks better in a hat. But his range of mental and physical activity is amazing. He neither smokes nor drinks and is an unflappable optimist. Simplot just returned from a two-week trip to Australia to inspect 11 food plants he recently bought for $300 million. He plays golf 201321 handicap 2013and skis. He recently addressed the Federal Reserve Bank. Accompany J.R. through one of his potato-processing plants and you soon find yourself trailing him across slop-slippery floors, up and over metal scaffolding blasted by starchy steam, and underneath clickety-clack packaging lines. 201cJ.R., 201d says everyone who knows him, 201cis incredible. 201d Officially, Simplot retired in April 1994, but each morning he drives the Spudmobile down from his home in the foothills 2014you can 2019t miss the 50-by-30-foot American flag on the 100-foot pole out front. He takes an elevator up to the 13th floor of the Capital Centre building on Main Street. There, in an office filled with pictures of family and the requisite Remington-style bronzes, he meets with the men who run Simplot. He 2019ll query them about cattle and potato prices, but clearly his new love is technology and Micron. 201cFella, we got something special in Micron. We 2019re leading the world. It 2019s real. It 2019s not just a bunch of bullshit. We 2019re rolling out the chips, 201d he says, eyes widening. Simplot has a growly, rolling, almost theatrical delivery 2013George C. Scott would do well as a movie version 2013that tends to rise in a crescendo at the end of sentences. It could be a radio voice, which isn 2019t surprising, since one of his best friends was the late broadcaster Lowell Thomas, whom he met years ago at Averell Harriman 2019s cottage at Sun Valley. Simplot stretches his solid 5-foot 10-inch frame and pulls out a little wallet-size display of Micron 2019s chips. 201cOn this little chip we can get 16 million bits of information. That 2019s 1,000 to 2,000 pages of information, and we can get it off the chip in a millionth of a second. 201d Okay, but what 2019s the connection? How is it that an 86-year-old farmer got mixed up in megabits? First, calling Simplot a farmer is like calling Bill Gates a college dropout. And second, a look at Simplot 2019s career shows that he has always harnessed the power of machines and technology to make quantum leaps in business. Simplot was born in Dubuque, Iowa, in 1909 and moved to Idaho when he was an infant. His family settled on the south bank of the Snake River and cleared the land to farm. At 14, he left home, dropped out of school, and built his first machine. It was a giant boiler for cooking up scrap potatoes and horse meat 2013from wild horses he shot out on the desert 2013to feed his hogs. The boiler helped him prepare mass quantities of food through a tough winter, and in the spring he sold his pigs for a profit of some $7,0, a small fortune at the time. The next machine that grabbed Simplot 2019s attention was an automatic potato sorter. Then still in his teens, Simplot and a partner ordered one of these machines. Simplot owned a 50% share and won the other half in a coin toss. That machine gave him a monopoly on the fast sorting of potatoes in Idaho, and Simplot was on his way to his first million. Another technological breakthrough: food dehydration. On a trip to California in 1940, Simplot saw an old prune drier adapted to drying onions. He ordered one and used it to create dehydrated potatoes, which fed the troops in World War II. That device helped make him an even wealthier man. His next breakthrough was successfully freezing potatoes, which had never been done until one of Simplot 2019s engineers discovered that the trick was blanching and compressing. That technology led to a deal with Ray Kroc in the mid-1960s for Simplot to sell frozen French fries to McDonald 2019s , which made him a billionaire. Micron was founded by a group of engineers, including one Ward Parkinson, who were joined by Parkinson 2019s twin brother, Joe, a lawyer. Raised in southeastern Idaho, the Parkinsons 2013who married and were divorced from sisters 2013worked potato fields and delivered spuds to Simplot warehouses as kids. They excelled in school and attended Columbia University in New York. After a decade of wandering and various jobs, the twins ended up in Boise, Ward doing contract engineering for Texas chipmaker Mostek and Joe doing dreary, small-city legal work. Ward and his engineering buddies had decided to form Micron in 1978. They set out to create a new, smaller version of the 64K DRAM chip, which is a memory chip that holds some 64,000 bits of information. (Joe ended up helping out so much he joined Micron and became head man.) One major problem: money. They needed sacks of it. The Parkinsons were introduced to Allen Noble, a farmer and inventor of irrigation systems, and to a couple of other potential investors, Tom Nicholson and Ron Yanke. The three men anted up $100,000 each-the Parkinsons pitched in too. Later they went to Simplot and his big bucks. And just who are these founders and insiders? All Idahoans of the old school. Take Nicholson and Yanke, who both became board members (though Yanke later left) and played significant roles in nurturing the company. Frontier-friendly and best friends since Boise High School 2013Nicholson was student body president, while next to Yanke 2019s yearbook picture it reads, 201cLanky but never lonesome 201d 2013they each own about a million shares of Micron stock today. One recent morning at Burns Bros. truck stop, Yanke and Nicholson arrive around 6 A.M. to eat and chat with the boys, including Bill Deasey, who preceded Bill Agee as CEO of Morrison Knudsen, and Harry Bettis, who owns some $85 million of stock in West One, Idaho 2019s biggest bank. These are conservative Republicans, though politically distant from the off-the-grid types who inhabit the state 2019s deep woods. Simplot, who says he 2019s been offered and has refused two U.S. Senate seats, says he stays out of active politics since he has to get along with politicians from both parties. After breakfast 2013a few order buffalo burgers and eggs, with hot sauce 2014Nicholson and Yanke hop into Yanke 2019s truck and head over to the airport. Hearing that Micron stock is down two points, Yanke flips on his Motorola cell phone and calls his broker. 201cGet me 10,000 shares of Micron. 201d Done deal. A $750,000 stock trade out of a 1.5-ton Dodge Ram. Then it 2019s up in Yanke 2019s Cessna Turbo 206 for a little elk spotting. (Is this their own private Idaho, or what?) 201cThere 2019s two, Ron, 201d calls Nicholson. 201cNo, Tom, those are cattle, 201d replies Yanke. 201cTurn the plane around, Rory, and let 2019s see. 201d In a blink the pilot twists the Cessna sideways, 100 feet off the tall timber just west of the Sawtooth Range at 125 miles per hour. 201cBarf bags are behind the seat, 201d says Nicholson. The pair fly up to the town of McCall, on Payette Lake, where many of Idaho 2019s power brokers 2013including Simplot and Yanke 2013have homes. Nicholson recalls a flight he made in the very same airplane with Micron co-founder Ward Parkinson back in the early 1980s when the company was struggling. Simplot 2019s people wouldn 2019t let him put in another penny, and Nicholson and Parkinson flew up to meet with Bill Agee, then CEO of the auto-parts company Bendix. (Agee was accompanied by his then-assistant Mary Cunningham.) 201cWe offered him 50% of Micron for about $1 million, 201d says Nicholson, who has known Agee for years. 201cAnd he said, 2018It won 2019t work: No. 2019 201d Much has been made of Bill Agee 2019s boneheaded moves. That 50% stake is now worth some $7.5 billion. But for Micron in the 1980s, Agee 2019s rejection was just another chapter in a Russian novel of nyets. 201cWe flew down to Dallas to talk with L.J. Sevin, head of Mostek, 201d recalls board member Allen Noble. 201cAnd he said, 2018You 2019ll never make chips up there, never. 2019 201d In an exercise of sheer hubris, the Parkinsons pushed ahead to build a fabrication plant (called a fab) while they were still designing their chip. Bankrolled to a large extent by Simplot, they completed the fab in 1981 for between $7 million and $10 million, a tenth the cost of a typical facility. The company turned out its first 64K DRAM in 1982. Micron went public in 1984. Terrible timing. Eleven U.S. firms would soon stop making DRAMs domestically 2013all except IBM, which mostly used the chips internally, and Micron 2013because the Japanese had broken into the market and crashed prices. 201cThey dropped the price of DRAMs from $2 to 25 cents and kept it there for 18 months, 201d roars Simplot. 201cThey were dumping! 201d At various points the company was in deep trouble. But eventually the Reagan Administration slapped a $300 million tariff on Japanese chips. Next, Micron was hit by a slowdown in the chip business. By 1990 the company had $333 million in sales, but profits of only $5 million. 201cWe learned from those years, 201d says Steve Appleton, the motorcycle-riding CEO. 201cWe learned that to survive, we had to become the lowest-cost producer. 201d Rather than focus on cutting-edge technology and then look for an application, engineers at Micron became experts at the process of making chips, especially a technique called shrinks. The smaller a company can make a chip, the more profit it can make, since tinier chips allow a company to produce more chips per batch. Chief technologist Tyler Lowrey, whom several board members call the company 2019s franchise player, explains that Micron has been known more for its expertise in manufacturing chips than for actual chip design: 201cOur hallmark has been process technology. We 2019ve been high volume. We don 2019t look for little niches. 201d So while the rest of the industry is now focused on making chips with 16 megs of memory (which can hold some 16 million bits of information), Micron still mostly churns out four megs. While most other companies have converted from six-inch to eight-inch wafers, Micron is just now switching over. Not that the company doesn 2019t keep up with the latest technology. But it makes changes conservatively, carefully weighing the costs. High volume, low cost is a familiar concept to Simplot, who 2019s used to doing battle in tight margin commodity markets. But if Simplot didn 2019t like the company 2019s strategy, he 2019d probably change it. He may not be in control of scheduling shifts, but he does call the big shots. As one card player at the Arid Club bluntly puts it, 201cThe board runs the company. 201d Initially, Appleton takes issue with that notion. 201cOur board, like any other board, decides what the company tells the public. It decides what executives are paid. And it determines what we do with the stock. 201d But when pressed, he admits that Micron 2019s board is 201cslightly different. 201d Major understatement. During Micron 2019s crisis years, the board began meeting every Monday morning at Elmer 2019s Pancake House. It 2019s a habit that stuck like syrup to a napkin. Even though the company now has billions in revenue, the board still gathers at Elmer 2019s 2013where two ceramic pigs stand guard on top of a rotating cake display 2013once a week at 5:45 A.M. Get there after six and Simplot will cock his head and ask, 201cWhat 2019s the matter, did you sleep in? 201d For breakfast Simplot passes on the short stack (which isn 2019t bad) and orders a bowl of raisin bran. He 2019s known to steal a few strips of bacon from the plates of other board members. Does this breakfast club really conduct serious business? 201cWe go over everything, 201d says Appleton. Perhaps that 2019s the kind of stifling oversight that precipitated the falling out between Joe Parkinson and Simplot. That, and the coincidence that both of them are as hardheaded as mountain goats. It 2019s been over a year since Parkinson 2013who 2019s now CEO of Integrated Information Technologies, a videochip company in Santa Clara, California 2013and Micron parted ways, and so far both sides have maintained a remarkable silence. But FORTUNE has pieced together what occurred. 201cYou have to understand they were two extremes, 201d says Appleton. 201cJoe Parkinson always liked to prepare for the worst, while J.R. Simplot is an eternal optimist. 201d That congenital divergence was reflected in nearly every decision the two men tried to make. Simplot says that Parkinson 2019s communications to shareholders were unnecessarily pessimistic and that Parkinson would sell his Micron stock instead of hanging on to it. 201cI offered him a $50,000 loan several times to buy stock and he refused it, 201d Simplot says. (Not that Parkinson needed to borrow $50,000 from Simplot.) Another divisive issue, Simplot says, was whether to expand the company, and if so, how to finance it. Says one Boise insider: 201cJoe was very suspicious of the markets. He wanted to hoard the company 2019s profits and issue stock to pay for any new fabs. 201d Obviously a strategy that diluted the stock was not going to find favor with Simplot. But there 2019s another side to the story. Sources on the board say Parkinson believed Simplot was talking up the company to his buddies down at the Arid Club and perhaps to Wall Street. In the process, they say, Parkinson said Simplot revealed insider information. Parkinson, wary of shareholder lawsuits 2013the company was sued in 1989 2013or an SEC investigation, had Simplot sign a highly unusual document in February 1993. This 201cindemnification 201d document 2013a copy of which FORTUNE has obtained 2013states that 201cSimplot will not disclose to anyone not employed by Micron any proprietary information about [Micron] 2026 201d And, 201cIn the event Simplot breaches the foregoing, Simplot will defend 2026 hold harmless, and indemnify Micron 2026 201d In October 1993, Simplot sent a letter to the Wall Street Journal talking up Micron 2019s stock. Not knowing whether the Journal would print the letter 2013it ultimately didn 2019t 2014the company felt compelled to issue a press release stating that 201cthe letter is a personal statement of Mr. Simplot, 201d that some of his comments were 201cfactually incorrect, 201d and that 201cMicron disavows any forecast of earnings. 201d Meanwhile, Parkinson confronted Simplot about his loose talk, but Simplot 2013who has run a private company his whole life 2013said he wasn 2019t sure he had revealed any numbers and that anyway he was not speaking for Micron and would damn well do as he pleased. This wasn 2019t the first time Simplot 2019s business conduct had been questioned. In one of the largest scandals ever to hit the commodity markets, he was charged with manipulating the potato futures market in 1976. Basically, Simplot sold short potato futures, some say trying to depress prices. Instead of buying back contracts to cover his position, he let them expire. When those who held the long contracts demanded payment, Simplot sent them potatoes 2013though not Maine potatoes as the contracts stipulated 2013instead of cash, setting off an eight-year legal battle. Bottom line: Simplot was barred from trading for six years, paid a $50,000 fine, and settled a civil suit for $1.4 million. In 1977, Simplot was charged with tax fraud for failing to report more than $1 million in corporate income and claiming over $250,000 of false personal and family deductions. He pleaded nolo contendere and paid two $20,000 fines. The conflict at Micron came to a head in September 1994, a week before the company was set to release yearly results. Over the weekend of September 17, Parkinson got a call informing him that Simplot again was spreading what Parkinson considered insider information 2013in this case Micron 2019s year-end earnings to the penny. On Monday, September 19, Simplot skipped the meeting at Elmer 2019s and drove out to the airport with his wife, Esther, to fly one of his Hawker jets to Canada for business. At Elmer 2019s, Parkinson told the board he wanted a special meeting that morning in the privacy of Micron 2019s boardroom to discuss the Simplot situation. Simplot was called and told of the meeting as he was about to board his plane. Simplot quickly drove the three miles over to Micron. When he arrived, the mood was somber. Board members say Parkinson asked Simplot if he was divulging insider information. Simplot said he didn 2019t believe he was. Parkinson said he could no longer serve with Simplot on the board. Parkinson then made a motion that Simplot not stand for reelection to the company 2019s board. But no one seconded the motion, and it failed. Simplot recalls reminding Parkinson of his controlling interest in over 20% of the stock. 201cHas it really come down to this, 201d Simplot asked, 201cthat it 2019s either you or me? 201d It had. 201cI 2019m not leaving, 201d said Simplot. So Parkinson and two allies, chief operating officer James Garrett and CFO Reid Langrill, resigned. It wasn 2019t the first time Parkinson had walked. Years earlier, Simplot lost his temper. 201cYou 2019re fired, 201d he said to Parkinson. 201cYou can 2019t do that, 201d responded Parkinson. 201cThen get out of my building, 201d J.R. growled. And Parkinson did. But this time Simplot was shaken and held his tongue. Parkinson insists it was only Simplot 2019s leaking confidential information and denying he did so to the board that caused him to leave the company. Insiders acknowledge Parkinson 2019s contribution, but many say privately that he could be difficult to work with. His twin, Ward, left the company in 1989 after some serious head butting. Most won 2019t comment on the record other than to compliment Parkinson 2019s successor, Steve Appleton. For instance: 201cSteve is someone who really listens, 201d says Gene Cloud, Micron 2019s head of marketing. Others say Simplot is the bad guy. He 2019s a manipulator, they claim, who hypes Micron 2019s stock. One board member says he sometimes cringes when Simplot starts talking during shareholder meetings. Simplot recently told FORTUNE: 201cThey might not want me saying this, but it 2019s my opinion. I think Micron is going to earn $12 a share next year. 201d Certainly, Simplot has his demons. His older sister Peggy lives back in south-central Idaho, but he doesn 2019t see or talk about her much. And his son Richard, who had battled alcoholism, died of diabetes in 1993. Except for his daughter Gay, his other children, who are all on the Simplot board, don 2019t seem to have anywhere near the same business acumen he does. His second wife, Esther, a classically trained singer in her early 60s, has preoccupations of her own. In 1991 she hired a mysterious Russian emigre to run the Ballet Idaho troupe 2013he left the company suddenly in 1993. In mid-September the nude and strangled body of the emigre 2019s wife was found in some brush down the hill from the Simplot house. But Simplot waves off all this unpleasantness. Personal tragedies, the feds, willful CEOs, lawsuits 2013Simplot seems to just brush them aside. With Parkinson gone, he has moved to push Micron harder. The company is expanding full bore, funded by internally generated cash, of course. Last fall Micron announced plans to build a new $2.5 billion fab complex in a to-be-determined location. That set off the usual speculation and courting by states and municipalities. By all accounts the company would have been content to stay in Boise 2013there 2019s nothing but acres of sagebrush surrounding its facility 2013but for a nasty intrastate squabble. Micron, which already employs 1,000 engineers, wanted to build its new plant near an engineering school to help supply it with a pool of trained labor. Boise State, mostly a commuter school, has no engineering program, but the University of Idaho, 220 miles to the north in the otherwise low-tech hamlet of Moscow, does. Would the state be willing to move the engineering school, or let Micron help underwrite one at Boise State? Negative on both counts. Even with Micron, the Hewlett-Packard plant, and Zilog, another thriving chipmaker, in Boise, the state refused to move the school and made it impossible for Boise State to run an accredited program. Simplot was livid. Not surprisingly, Micron announced the plant would not be built in Idaho but in Oklahoma, Nebraska, or Utah. Still, Simplot wanted to give it one more shot. On the morning of February 20 of this year, he demanded that a special joint meeting of the legislature be convened (that day!) so that he could address the lawmakers on the engineering school brouhaha! The lawmakers agreed to listen to him that afternoon in the statehouse 2019s largest hearing room. Despite a half-hour appeal by Simplot, the upstate forces wouldn 2019t change their minds. So on July 1, Micron broke ground in Lehi, Utah, at a site 20 miles equidistant from the University of Utah 2019s and Brigham Young 2019s solid engineering schools. What happened to Nebraska? Says Simplot: 201cWell, Warren Buffett called me up and talked to me for about 20 minutes trying to convince me to move the plant down there. He 2019s a nice fella, but we just decided on Utah. 201d Micron hasn 2019t exactly given up on Boise. The company is spending $900 million to expand its 1.8-million-square-foot headquarters. Every room, clean or otherwise, is buzzing with the business of making chips and is simultaneously expanding. Chipmaking equipment is so expensive and becomes outdated so quickly that shifts must work 24 hours to amortize. In one 2,000-square-foot space, dozens of $2.5 million chip testers are being installed. Half a mile down the road from Micron, a brand-new housing development 2013put up by guess who 2013is open for business. In a quirky television commercial, Simplot looks into the camera and barks, 201cYou young people 2026 get a piece of the action! 201d The 64-megabit question: Is Micron moving ahead too fast? The Idaho Statesman recently reported Micron is set to build another new plant in Ireland. Certainly, demand for DRAMs can 2019t grow much faster. Worldwide semiconductor sales are expected to grow an amazing 40% this year, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. The market for chips has become humongous. Micron, which has only a 5.5% share, could do $5.5 billion in sales in fiscal 1996 (which ends in August). The diversified Asian giants 2013Samsung, Hitachi, NEC, and Toshiba 2013control over 40% of the market, though much of their production is for internal use. Right now Micron 2019s profits are fat indeed. Net margins are over 28%. Prices for chips, which usually decline 30% annually, have risen or held flat for three years. Driving demand for Micron 2019s chips is the boom in PCs, which need increasing amounts of memory. Simplot, who doesn 2019t even own a computer ( 201cHell, boy, I came before the goddamn typewriter 201d), was recently given a demonstration of Windows 95. His assessment: 201cI love that program. It uses all kinds of memory. 201d But will demand for PCs hold? Over 50 fabs are under construction around the world right now 2013including one by Taiwan 2019s Chia Hsin Livestock 2013which will eventually depress prices. A few security analysts have expressed concern over possible declines in chip prices, though they haven 2019t cited any weakness in Micron 2019s business. Fidelity Investments, which owned 26 million shares (12.7%) of Micron 2019s stock in January, has cut back to 18 million shares (8.9%) as of October 1. And so the stock has dropped 25% in six weeks. At its high on September 11, Micron had a market capitalization of over $20 billion. That 2019s bigger than Texaco 2019s. Even today, at nearly $15 billion, Micron 2019s market value is greater than that of Sara Lee or Merrill Lynch. Simplot isn 2019t at all concerned about the stock price: 201cHell, I 2019d buy more today, but my broker at Merrill Lynch won 2019t let me. Says I have to diversify. 201d Micron bulls point to the company 2019s tremendous profitability and its nearly debt-free balance sheet. They argue that Windows 95 upgrades, plus strong demand from consumers, plus overseas growth, will keep chip sales and margins strong for the foreseeable future. Yes, they say, new fabs are coming online, but long backlogs of chipmaking equipment are slowing capacity expansion. For now, executives at Micron are upbeat. 201cChristmas is going to be a blowout, 201d says Gene Cloud, echoing others. Says one board member, sipping coffee up at the truck stop: 201cIf we don 2019t earn $2 billion next fiscal year, something is wrong with us. 201d Simplot is looking for $2.5 billion. To free themselves of the memory-chip product cycle, Appleton and company are looking to diversify. 201cWe aren 2019t just focusing on DRAMs anymore. We 2019re making products to fill fabs, 201d says technologist Tyler Lowrey. Those products include little marker chips that can be slapped on airport luggage or pieces of mail, and flash memory chips, which need no energy source to retain information. Micron is also becoming a major force in PCs. Last year the company merged Zeos, a mail-order PC maker, into its own computer business. The new company, Micron Electronics (MUEI), with $1 billion in annual sales, trades on Nasdaq and is 79% owned by Micron. MUEI",

Data from the report is expected to show that the market remained near its 13-month high, reached in October. Low borrowing costs and a higher rate of household formations helped boost the sustained recovery in home sales. Economists expect existing home sales to reach 5.2 million in November, just shy of October 2019s 5.26 million. U.S. new home sales follow on Tuesday morning and are expected to also be little changed from the previous month. Economists expect new home sales to rise 0.4% month-over-month to 460,000 new home sales. Personal spending figures will also be released on Tuesday. Economists are predicting that personal spending rose at a faster rate last month than in October due to an improving job market and lower gas prices during the start of the holiday-shopping season. Economists expect personal spending to rise 0.5% month-over-month. 2. Walgreen reports its fiscal first quarter earnings. The Deerfield, Ill.-based drug store chain will report its quarterly results Tuesday. Analysts anticipate earnings-per-share, adjusted for one-time items, to be 75 cents, an increase compared to the year earlier period. Sales are also expected to be higher at $19.6 billion, according to Bloomberg data. If competitor Rite Aid RAD is any indication, Walgreen 2019s WAG shares could be in for a big boost if earnings hit or exceed expectations. Rite Aid 2019s stock surged over 16% in pre-market trading Thursday after an earnings report that blew past whisper estimates. 3. Family Dollar shareholders vote on Dollar Tree acquisition. Family Dollar FDO is holding a special meeting of shareholders Tuesday to vote on its acquisition of Dollar Tree DLTR . The Charlotte, N.C.-based dollar store inked a deal to buy its rival for $8.5 billion in cash and stock after a bitter battle with third competitor Dollar General DG . The Federal Trade Commission has been reviewing the merger to determine whether the companies need to sell off some of their stores before the deal can be completed. The meeting was rescheduled from Dec. 11 after Family Dollar provided additional disclosures to shareholders about the FTC review. Most of the world markets will be closed for at least part of the Christmas holidays. The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq close at 1 p.m. ET on Wednesday and will remain closed through Thursday, Christmas Day. Many European markets, including London, Frankfurt, Milan and Paris, will also be closed the Friday following. 5. The final days of Christmas shopping. There 2019s just three full days left to buy any last-minute holiday gifts 2013and retailers are continuing their battle to get shoppers in the door.

   "input": "Succeeding as an entrepreneur takes hard work and persistence because, unfortunately, there is no business-startup fairy who magically bestows success on small businesses and their owners. Most successful entrepreneurs follow comparable patterns and share similar basic characteristics. Hundreds of online articles and published books claim to know the secret of success in business, but for the most part, they boil down to the same major points. Passion, perseverance and a positive attitude tend to set successful entrepreneurs apart. Cultivating these attributes requires an innate skill set and some tips to get started. So here are the main items to take into consideration if you 2019re trying to develop a business platform. These elements constitute will support a smart strategy for any new enterprise: Passion is key to keeping a business strategy moving. Half-heartedness in an entrepreneurial endeavor will chip away at your drive to succeed. Perseverance is the one thing that 2019s guaranteed to move anything over time, whether it 2019s a person, a job or an entire company. Abraham Lincoln failed at most of his efforts until late in his life, but he never gave up. Jumping all in is rarely ever successful. There are success stories about people who invested everything once and came out winners after six months or a couple years, but those are rare. Risk management is an essential factor in any startup, and balance is vital. You can absorb losses more easily if you take smaller risks in the beginning. Those will provide essential and productive lessons. Successful entrepreneurs often worked for others in their field of choice before striking out on their own. Spending a few years in the industry under an excellent mentor will provide a good launching pad. Learn from your predecessors 2019 mistakes and brainstorm about how to improve upon their model. Find someone willing to teach, and think about starting your business elsewhere when you leave. Confidence and a good elevator speech can take any pitch to the next level. The first marketing any company experiences comes from its founder. Spend time learning how to share your vision without coming across as 201csalesy. 201d Don 2019t be afraid to ask for the sale, but remember: the client is always the focus. Entrepreneurs are movers and shakers. They can 2019t afford to analyze every detail or they 2019d never get anywhere. There is no place for procrastination in a startup. It 2019s a 24 7, no-vacation-or-sick-days kind of job that demands constant forward momentum. Make a brief assessment at every step and move on it. Trust your instincts. Read about successful businesses. Take in the wealth of knowledge that 2019s been provided by successful entrepreneurs such as Steve Jobs and the personalities from Shark Tank. A successful business plan does not have to be a book. A 10-page plan is digestible yet long enough to include everything you need to start. According to Brandi Bennett at HostGator.com, maintaining a blog on a well-hosted website, or volunteering your time and skills, shows instead of tells the community, and thereby builds expertise and trust. Many successful entrepreneurs started later in life. J. K. Rowling (Harry Potter author), Julia Child (chef), and Sam Walton (Wal-Mart) all started their wildly successful brands after they were comfortably along in their lives. Having the experience that comes with age can give you a unique outlook on your business. Life experiences bring depth that the most educated young adult, by his or her nature, is less able to foresee. Finding the skill sets and attitudes that support the culture of the brand you want to promote will foster innovation and enhance your reputation. Include folks from outside the company for the people you rely on. That will start a free marketing chain reaction that can build confidence and revenue. The attitude of the founder will set the tone for the business. Negativity, laziness and entitlement waste time and money while they tarnish your reputation. Success largely depends on making mistakes and accepting blame in stride. Owning up to and facing challenges head-on is what makes a mere business owner a leader. Starting a business can wreak havoc on the owner 2019s personal life. While all the above tips are necessary for success, taking care of yourself mentally and physically is also imperative. Exercise, sleep and diet play a central role in ensuring you implement these policies successfully. All of them drive attitude, motivation and relationships. Successful CEOs tend to follow a structured, daily schedule of rising early, exercising, having snacks on hand for fuel and socializing many evenings of the week. Striking a balance may take a while, but working toward this list as a goal for starting your company will make the difference. How an owner feels about progress and how quickly a business can be up and running 2014 and feeding that bottom line 2014 will swiftly feel the impact.

   "input": "A candle lit dinner with a nice bottle of wine, a trip to the movies with a shared bucket of popcorn, a night in with Netflix and cuddling on the couch -- these date ideas can certainly be fun, but sometimes you need to spice it up a little. Or maybe you need to spice it up a lot? When it comes to adrenaline junkies and thrill seekers, dinner and a movie doesn't always cut it. When you're thinking of making your next date a little more exciting than your last, we 2019ve put together a few suggestions. Regardless of where you live, you can find adventurous dates nearby. You don 2019t need to travel to South Africa to swim with sharks and you don 2019t need to go to France to try heli-skiing -- these adventures, along with others, can be found across the U.S. All you need is a sense of adventure, a little planning and maybe a long weekend to enjoy a date that will bring you two closer than ever. For the most addicted adrenaline junkies, bungee jumping is a perfect date idea. Though New Zealand is credited with the advent of the activity, there are many suitable jump spots in the U.S. The bridge to nowhere over the San Gabriel River in California is an amazing experience, but if you need the biggest, baddest, highest jump head to the Rio Grande Bridge in Taos, N.M. -- the drop is a mind-blowing 680 feet. It's easy to overlook all the incredible nature and wildlife that 2019s right in our own backyard. Take time to appreciate the beauty with your date on a U.S. wildlife safari. In Wyoming, Jackson Hole Wildlife Safaris will send you out with an experienced guide to explore the Grand Tetons or Yellowstone National Park. If you're looking for something a bit more tropical, the Everglades Safari Park in Florida offers unparalleled views of alligators along with airboat rides or kayak tours -- talk about adventure. It's tough to find a winter date as romantic as a ski adventure and there 2019s no better way to go above and beyond (literally) than heli-skiing. Though this adventure will cost quite a bit, there are plenty of amazing spots in the U.S. and Canada. Intermediate skiers should check out Helitrax in Telluride, Colo., and hardcore powder hounds should head to Valdez, Alaska where they'll find the company H2O Guides. H2O is run by world champion skier Dean Cummings and they have 2.6 million acres at their disposal -- it's safe to say you won't be bored. Strapping a board (or boards) to your feet not your style? Prefer the uphill trek? Snowshoeing is a fun date idea that packs in a vigorous workout, with ample time to talk and gorgeous views. Head to Mt. Hood, Ore., for the Boy Scout Ridge trail, which starts out nice and easy but builds to gain a total of 1,800 feet of elevation or take to the White Mountains in New Hampshire, which are known for their snowy winters and incredible views and take a moonlit snowshoe tour. Reach new heights in your relationship -- literally. Rock climbing is a great activity for two. If you or your date is a beginner, hit an indoor course and race each other to the top. If you 2019re a couple of thrill seekers take a course in outdoor climbing. Experts say that it 2019s such a popular activity for couples because it relies heavily on communication and trust, two important aspects in relationships. And as an added bonus it's a great full-body work out. Professional instruction is strongly recommended and you can find indoor and outdoor spots all over the country. You can't go wrong when the date involves a bunch of adorable dogs and a side of adventure. Though it may seem like an activity lost in time, dogsledding is still widely celebrated. In the U.S., Mahoosuc Guide Service in Maine offers a variety of experiences and even gives guests an option to train and drive a team of dogs and in Minnesota the Wintergreen Dogsled Lodge was called the best in the business by National Geographic and the area is known for stunning scenery. If skiing or snowboarding isn't for you, this adventure can take you down the mountain in a totally different way. Fly from some seriously high peaks at Sun Valley in Idaho or take the leap from the Tetons in Jackson Hole, Wyo. Though you and your date will have to travel separately, you'll share the spectacular experience and can meet at the bottom for a celebratory glass of champagne.

   "input": "Updated MAR 09, 2015 8:38p ET GLENDALE, Ariz. -- The scouting report on the Diamondbacks' Nick Ahmed reads differently, depending on which of the shortstop's tools is being addressed. As a prospect, FanGraphs considers him a below-average hitter at 30 to 40 on the 20-80 baseball scouting scale. Defensively, the site views him as a high-level talent, rated at 65. The Diamondbacks might be willing to call that defensive figure inaccurate, even though it's a fine compliment as a subjective statistic could be. Nick Ahmed , we feel like he's a guy defensively who's as good as anybody in the major leagues, Arizona manager Chip Hale said at the beginning of spring training. The rating system , when people scout, an 80 is the best you can be, like a (Albert) Pujols in his prime, a Barry Bonds when he was in his prime. This guy is close to that, as a defender. And that explains why the 24-year-old is considered a potential option at shortstop as Arizona decides upon an Opening Day roster -- even though Chris Owings , who could be shifted to second base, is on track to return from shoulder surgery in October. With such high praise toward Ahmed's defensive instincts and abilities, it's fairly obvious what is biggest challenge is in earning a starting job. We need to score runs , Hale said. We need to put people across home plate. That's why I say about Ahmed , the defense is fantastic, we just need to get his offense up to speed with that. Chris (Owings) is pretty much the total package with that. Ahmed , acquired in 2013 as part of the trade package that sent Justin Upton to the Atlanta Braves, recorded one hit in his final 18 at-bats of 2014 while filling in for the injured Owings. He finished the year hitting .200 with an .233 on-base percentage, but he feels the spot duty wasn't representative of where his swing was or is now. Ahmed's bat showed some life last summer at Triple-A Reno after a tough 2013 season in Double-A Mobile in which he hit just .236. The 24-year-old finished last year with a slash line of .312 .373 .425 and scored 57 runs in 104 games at Reno, known as a hitter's paradise. Ahmed's big adjustment was lowering his hand placement on the bat. Everybody says , oh, it's Reno, Hale said. You still have to do it. Translating that success once Ahmed was called up to the majors was difficult. Spot duty didn't help him find confidence at the plate. That role was something new to me , he said. Definitely , didn't really take hold of that role and hit and produce to the best of my abilities, I don't think. It was definitely a learning process. I've gotten a lot better. On Sunday , Ahmed's seventh-inning double pushed a run across the plate during a 12-2 win against the San Francisco Giants. He followed up that two-hit outing Monday with a 0-for-3 peformance in the D-backs' 3-3 tie against the White Sox. The most important thing is he's getting a lot of at-bats. Heading into camp, the staff asked the shortstop if he felt good about his swing. He did. So there's been little tinkering with his mechanics, and the D-backs have allowed Ahmed to go after a roster spot with the tools he's already comfortable with. I heard (former MLB player) Kevin Millar talk about , one time, what the minor leagues exist for in baseball, compared to other sports where there's not a minor league system, Ahmed said. He said , baseball's a game of failure, the minor leagues are designed to teach players how to fail. I kind of took that to heart in 2013 when I was in Mobile and just failed day after day after day for the first two months. I learned more about myself in those two months than I have the rest of my career. He hopes to use the rest of March to show the D-backs staff how much he's learned from it. The D-backs already knows he's more than prepared as a shortstop. Follow Kevin Zimmerman on Twitter  ",

   "input": "Last August, Barcelona photographer Vicens Forner snapped a picture that showed up in newspapers around the globe: In it, a group of young Italian tourists are cavorting through the streets of his seafront neighborhood, Barceloneta. It is mid-afternoon, and the guys are the very image of happy travelers. For many in working class Barceloneta, the Italian flesh was the last straw. Over the next few evenings, several thousand locals poured onto the humid summer streets to chant and bang pots in protest of tourism overload. Their banners read, 201cThe neighborhood is not for sale. 201d Like many European cities, from Paris to Prague to Venice, Barcelona has bet hard on tourism. The city began to woo tourists with the 1992 Olympics, when it cleaned its beaches, built cruise ship docks, expanded its airport, and rehabilitated its neglected Old City, the Ciutat Vella. And the tourists complied: according to government figures, between 1990 and 2013 the number of annual visitors who stayed overnight exploded from 1.7 million to 7.6 million, and the number of hotel rooms grew from 10,265 to 37,069. Today, tourism account for about 14% of the Barcelona 2019s economy. But now many locals are asking, how much tourism is too much? In this compact city of 1.6 million residents, the tourist impact is impossible to miss. Today, 79% of the people on La Rambla, the main avenue in the Ciutat Vella, are not from Barcelona; 58% are foreign tourists. Packs of bachelor and bachelorette parties from around Europe stumble through the Ciutat Vella at night, regularly vomiting in the streets and hiring prostitutes. And the effects are not limited to the Ciutat Vella. Tourists groups and buses have made the areas around monuments designed by famed Catalan architect Antoni Gaud 00ed 2013 most notably Park G 00fcell and the Sagrada Familia, both UNESCO World Heritage sites 2013 virtually unrecognizable as residential neighborhoods. In the most touristic barrios, residents are losing their apartments as landlords convert them into short stay rentals, and it is difficult for those who remain to find stores selling anything but cheap beer, souvenirs, and the No. 10 jersey of Barcelona soccer star Lionel Messi. It is this loss of local identity, as much as the tourist hordes, that make people like Llum Ventura Gil, a longtime Barceloneta resident who recently left the barrio because of tourism overload, complain that their neighborhoods have been turned into 201ctheme parks. 201d 201cBarcelona is losing its essence, 201d she says. Barcelona is not alone, and the struggle of European cities has even spawned a subgenre of documentaries bemoaning mass tourism. Barcelona has Bye Bye Barcelona, a film by Venezuelan filmmaker Eduardo Chib 00e1s that has received over 300,000 YouTube views; Berlin has Welcome and Goodbye; and Venice has The Venice Syndrome. (One common feature of the genre? The irritating sound of squads of roller bags clicking over cobblestones.) The head of Barcelona 2019s hotel chamber, Jordi Clos, says the city should aim to get to 10 million overnight tourists a year to put it in the 201cfirst division 201d of European cities. But locals question whether mass tourism has already made parts of the city unlivable. Many Barcelonans have fled: between 2006 and 2013,14,600 people 2013 12.3% of the population 2013 left Ciutat Vella. Pushed by citizen protests, the city and regional government has finally begun to take action. Last year it put a moratorium on new licenses for short-stay apartments and fined Airbnb 20ac30,000 for hawking illegal tourist rentals. After the Barceloneta outburst, it sent more police and inspectors into the neighborhood and began to bust landlords who rent out unlicensed tourist units, quickly closing 170 short-term apartments. And in late February, some 250 locals packed a public audience (while many more waited outside) to grill one of Barcelona 2019s deputy mayors on the city 2019s plans for handling tourism. But the going is slow and some question whether the local government has the political will to regulate one of Barcelona 2019s prime industries. 201cThe government very much favors the big tourism industry, particularly hotels, 201d says Claire Colomb, an urban planning researcher at University College London. 201cThere are huge economic interests at stake that make regulation very difficult. 201d Tourism has enriched cities like Barcelona in financial and other ways. The irony of mass tourism, however, is that it destroys the enchantment that attracted tourists in the first place. It 2019s unclear if efforts to regulate it will come too late to 201csave 201d Barcelona from its success. 201cTourism is unstoppable, 201d says the filmmaker Chib 00e1s. 201cIt 2019s how you manage it so it doesn 2019t become another Venice. 201d Watch more business news from Fortune:  ",

(See: I think Kym has become Mary Poppins 00e2 0080 00a6 a very sexy Mary Poppins , by the way. See also: I'm gonna love you in a Mary Poppins outfit.) Despite their incredible on- and off-the-dance floor sparks , this week's routine fell flat. The star got off on the wrong foot, literally, and was off the beat. Even so, Robert brought the razzle-dazzle , as judge put it , and was beaming like he does when a contestant brings a dog to their pitch. Extra points to Robert for always being a spoonful of sugar. In a word, Riker and Allison's -themed routine was explosive. The alum made the paso doble his wench, hitting all the right moves in a way Jack Sparrow never could because he'd be too sloshed. The production was grand (the ship! a cannon!), but unlike 's routine, Riker and Allison's choreography never got lost in the jumble. It was clear that Riker, a huge fan of the movie, was having fun from the first foot-stomp, making for infectious, can't-take-your-eyes-off-him television. That is what I call artistry , said Julianne. Technique , concept, passion, showmanship: That is what artistry is about. Well done. Asked what princess she wants to be this week , Rumer burst into a laugh: Can I be a villain? Lucky for viewers , Val complied. Prepping to play Ursula, she actually jumped in a pool to practice channeling the evil octopus's underwater moves. She got into character once she hit the ballroom, too: Emerging from Ursula's grotto, Rumer's moves were fluid and downright sexy. And when she got up in the judge's faces, lip-synching the make your choice! lyric? Delicious.

   "input": "THE ritual of wine service in restaurants often seems intended to intimidate and confuse the customer rather than to get the wine on the table with dispatch, and sometimes the ceremony annoys Michael Rowan, the wine maker for the Jordan Vineyard and Winery in Healdsburg, Calif. So he has developed a technique that enables him to disarm pretentious wine stewards and amuse his companions. He did it the first time on the spur of the moment. ''As soon as I saw him, I knew it would be a hassle,'' he recalled, referring to a sommelier. The man was dressed all in black and wore two silver chains around his neck, one for a large key, ostensibly to the wine cellar, the other for a tasting cup. His manner was formal, even severe, and he obviously was not aware that he was dealing with an experienced oenophile. Mr. Rowan knew which wine he wanted to order, but the process took far longer than it should have. Finally the bottle arrived, and the sommelier uncorked it with a flourish and presented the cork for inspection, whereupon Mr. Rowan put it in his mouth and chewed it up. He sagely nodded his head, indicating that the cork had been approved, and motioned for the horrified sommelier to pour the wine. As the glasses were filled, Mr. Rowan kept spitting out bits of cork and nodding his head in approval. ''The guy never even smiled,'' he said, but the others at his table were practically falling off their chairs. Mr. Rowan's technique is perhaps extreme, but it clearly reflects one person's annoyance with pretension in wine service. He would readily concede that some of the ritual may be necessary, but he abhors the unnecessary trappings and supercilious attitudes that so often surround the simple task of obtaining wine in a restaurant. Just how much of the ritual is necessary? Or is any of it really necessary? The fact is that a certain procedure should be followed in serving wine, and its purpose is twofold: to enable the customer to determine whether the wine is sound and to insure that the wine is displayed at its best. Any aspect of wine service that is not intended to achieve this purpose is unnecessary. First, the bottle should be presented for inspection, and there is no pretension in this step. The customer needs to know whether he is getting the bottle that he ordered, and the waiter also wants to make sure there is no mistake. The customer should be sure to check the vintage, because many restaurants neglect to revise their wine lists to reflect inventory changes. Even the best restaurants occasionally receive replacement wines of different vintages that are served before the list can be changed, but a sommelier who is doing his job properly will inform the customer when this is the case. Not to do so would be deceptive. Once the bottle has been inspected and determined to be the one ordered, the sommelier should remove the capsule, the lead foil or plastic covering the end of the bottle, and should then clean the neck. Many waiters simply cut off the top of the capsule, but they should remove enough of the lead so that the bulge or ridge in the bottle's neck, which is designed to prevent dripping, is completely exposed. Deposits that collect under the capsule can affect the flavor of the wine, and they are likely to find their way into the customer's glass if not enough of the lead or plastic is removed. Many waiters simply tear off the entire capsule. When the cork is removed, it is customarily presented for inspection, enabling the customer to see whether it is in good condition. Actually, it is probable that not one customer in a thousand can learn anything from examining the cork, and this is one part of the ritual that may be superfluous. But there is an exception. Many European wineries brand their corks not only with the name of the wine but also with the vintage. It can be comforting to have the information on the label confirmed by the cork, assuring that there was no mixup in labeling. But it is also true that many corks are unbranded and convey no information. Next, a small amount of wine should be poured into the customer's glass so that he can taste it. This is a critical moment, and there is considerable confusion over its purpose. The goal is to determine whether the wine is sound, to assure that it has not turned bad in the bottle. How does the customer know? A bad white wine will have begun to turn a golden color or sometimes even brown and will emit a sweetish, Madeira-like odor. In fact, one form of deterioration in white wines is called maderization. The wine actually takes on some of the characteristics of Madeira, the sweet, fortified wine from the Portuguese island of the same name. A bad red will also have begun to turn brown and will display a similar odor. But keep in mind that a fully mature red wine in top condition will often have a brownish tinge. If there is any doubt, the sommelier should be asked to taste the wine, and if it has turned bad he should be happy to take it back. Under what circumstances should a wine be decanted? The chief purpose of decanting is to eliminate sediment, the natural deposit that develops in red wines as they reach maturity, usually after eight or 10 years but sometimes earlier. A good sommelier should advise whether he thinks decanting is necessary, but the customer may want to pose the question. Decanting is accomplished by gently pouring the clear wine off the sediment into another container, perhaps a crystal decanter, perhaps a pitcher, perhaps simply another clean wine bottle. A candle is often used to illuminate the wine as it flows through the neck of the bottle, so that the process can be halted when the sediment begins flowing. A cradle or basket may be used to keep the bottle in a horizontal position prior to and during decanting if the bottle has been lying on its side in a rack. But ideally the bottle should be stood upright before decanting so that the sediment will sink to the bottom. One aspect of the wine ritual that should be abolished is the use of baskets or cradles for wines that are not being decanted. They are affectations that serve no purpose and take up additional space on the table. And if they are used in lieu of decanting on the theory that the sediment will remain lying calmly against the bottom of the glass, they are counterproductive, for the sediment is stirred up every time the bottle is tipped for pouring.

   "input": "No one can say that the seven candidates in Tuesday's mayoral election have avoided talking about some of the problems or suggesting solutions. But the most original ideas seem to have little connection with political reality. Crime is up, and the Right to Life Party candidate proposes amputating the fingers of criminals one at a time. The subways are abysmal, and the Socialist Workers Party candidate suggests making them free. The economy is stagnant, and the Free Libertarian nominee recommends eliminating income taxes. There are candidates, too, on the Liberal, Conservative and Unity Party lines, but their discussions center less on new ideas than on the simple assertion that Edward I. Koch has not been a very good Mayor. One result of all this is a consensus that Mr. Koch, the first mayoral candidate nominated by both major parties, has had a free ride in the post-primary political season. His re-election is as certain as sunrise, and both he and his opponents appear only to be going through the motions of a campaign. No one has pressed the Mayor to reveal his plans for his second term, and he has volunteered as little as he did during the primaries, when he dismissed the notion of campaign promises as unnecessary and perhaps unworthy. Nor is there evidence that Mr. Koch and his lieutenants have even chosen a direction for the next four years, although people close to the Mayor insist that such matters will be discussed before Inauguration Day, Jan. 1. If so, they may be forced to conclude is that answers are as elusive as ever, a point reinforced by events after the primary. To the extent that Mr. Koch has pledged anything it is that services will improve in the next four years. So far, that has tended to mean he will hire more city employees - police officers, teachers, sanitation workers. But there are signs that the money may not be available to expand the municipal labor force. Last week, the chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, Felix G. Rohatyn, called retrenchment ''inevitable.'' Even if all the workers are hired, however, the people charged with making the city run say that would not be enough. ''The only way to improve services is to change the way things are done,'' says Nathan Leventhal, the Deputy Mayor for Operations. That means increasing employee productivity, and the city has focused on forms of ''gainsharing,'' in which a portion of productivity savings is handed over to the workers. The Koch administration's biggest success in that realm, perhaps, was replacing some rear-loading three-man sanitation trucks with side-loading trucks carrying crews of two, each of whom gets a bonus of $11 a shift. Yet spreading the gain-sharing concept to other areas, such as one-man police patrol cars, has proved tricky. Moreover, with city labor contracts expiring June, productivity talks are unlikely to become easier. While key services including schools, hospitals and the subway system are beyond Mr. Koch's direct control, he nonetheless has a big say in how they are run. That point was underscored not long ago when the president of the Transit Authority, John D. Simpson, said, ''If the Mayor thinks it's important, I think it's important.'' How much Mr. Koch wishes to use this pulpit has always been unclear, and would seem to depend on circumstances and on how willing he is to accept blame for failures. In the schools, where he can point to improved reading scores, he has taken considerable credit. In the subways - called worse than ever two weeks ago by the New York Public Interest Research Group - he has tended to shrug about how little he can do, Mr. Simpson's observation notwithstanding. Law enforcement is another vital question - his No. 1 priority, Mr. Koch says. He plans to add 2,300 new police officers in the current fiscal year. He pledges they will be hired even if President Reagan wins proposed budget cuts that could deprive the city of an estimated $69 million on top of the $273 million lost in the first round of Federal cuts. But with or without new officers, no one expects a sudden drop in crime. If anything, several brutal assaults in the last few weeks, including the rape of a nun in an East Harlem convent, have highlighted for many New Yorkers the fragile nature of the city's social fabric. Mr. Koch seems to be counting on demographics to solve the problem -a population with a rising average age is likely to produce a smaller percentage of criminals. Then there are the Mayor's ineluctable racial difficulties, which were made plainer than ever when blacks voted against him 2 to 1 in both the Democratic and Republican primaries. He says he will try to do better. But his opponents have kept up a rataplan of attacks on the race issue, and in response Mr. Koch has dug in his heels. His voice has acquired a growing truculence as he insists again and again that no one could reasonably dispute the substance of his record on race and that the real problem is his ''personality.'' Perhaps more than anything else, events during the desultory campaign have made clear how much lies beyond the control of any Mayor, even one elected with the overwhelming support Mr. Koch expects to have. He has an ambitious 10-year capital program to rebuild New York's physical plant, but chaos in the municipal bond market may force him to trim his sails. A sluggish economy would make it harder for the city to balance its budget next year. Relatively hard times in Europe lead to fewer foreign tourists on Fifth Avenue, and that, in turn, leads to shrunken tax revenues. All of which means that when the glow of Mr. Koch's re-election wears off, reality could once again descend hard on City Hall. Mr. Koch, for one, does not seem worried; he is comfortable with, or at least reconciled to, uncertainty. ''Tell me,'' he once asked a visitor to his office, ''what in life is certain?''

   "input": "THE SITUATION IS HOPELESS By Ronald Searle. Illustrated. Unpaginated. New York: A Studio Book The Viking Press. $12.95. CARICATURISTS, as any caricaturist can tell you, live, work and die in a shantytown scarcely visible from that monumental Brasilia known as the world of art. Not even the young ones expect much from so lowly a calling. In the art histories no caricaturist is ever regarded as a major artist unless, like Daumier, he dusts himself off and does some paintings and sculpture. The few miserable souls in fine art classes who are interested in caricature pass around pictures by the artists they admire, quietly, as if in some Novosibirsk samizdat network. In the 1950's the hero of the samizdat in the United States was an Englishman, Ronald Searle. His amazing drawings of the bon ton and the low life in New York, Paris, Las Vegas, San Francisco, New Orleans and London were cut out of magazines and passed around until the sulfite had a nap on it. The best of America's daily political cartoonists, Jeff MacNelly and Pat Oliphant, had Searle as their starting point, as did England's Gerald Scarfe and Ralph Steadman. The publication of ''The Situation Is Hopeless,'' Searle's 50th book, counting collaborations, will have artists everywhere looking back across the career of this giant of the graphic netherworld. Searle created a new approach to caricature by combining the highly conventionalized, two-dimensional drawing that came out of French modernism with a peculiarly British attention to details of costume, furniture, architecture, ornament, facial expression, gesture and the bric-a-brac of social life. The contradiction between the simplicity of the line and the clutter of the content tends to make even the most pointless Searle drawing funny. Searle's draftsmanship was at its simplest in the show that made him famous just after the Second World War: an exhibition at the Cambridge School of Art of 300 drawings he had done while a prisoner of the Japanese in Malaysia. His drawings of British soldiers dying of cholera in the prison camps seemed all the more powerful for the spareness of his technique. Some had been done with makeshift markers, such as burnt-out matches. From that show came his first book, ''Forty Drawings,'' published in 1946. So far as I know, Searle has never returned to somber subject matter. Throughout the late 1940's he was popular in England for a vein of black farce, most notably in his ''Belles of St. Trinian's'' cartoon series, from which the St. Trinian's movies were made. In the United States he was known for his Holiday drawings of New York, Las Vegas and other cities. His modernist line and his British eye for social detail achieved their consummation in these drawings, collected in the book ''Which Way Did He Go?'' in 1961. They rank among the finest drawings of cities since Dore's London drawings of 1872. Like Dore and other great caricaturists and illustrators, from Rowlandson to David Levine, Searle had occasionally exhibited his Serious Work, that is, his paintings. Here his modernist streak, his penchant for flat design and for color, usually in the hot pastel range, come through strongly. (And like most other great caricaturists and illustrators, he has not been taken seriously in his Serious Mode.) This sort of design and color dominate Searle's humorous drawings today. The humor itself has become more blithe than topical. The play between formalism and literalism reached a baroque state in ''Ronald Searle,'' a major collection published in 1978. We see more Searle Baroque in ''The Situation Is Hopeless.'' In this modern bestiary he gives us such creatures as a pink rat with a tentative and bemused expression amid mauve and bottle-green stone arches, and the caption, ''Fastidious rat looking for an impeccable sewer.'' Many of the jokes seem merely capricious until one begins to fit the beasts to their human counterparts. A ''retarded ape happy in the knowledge that it is the ancestor of man'' plays with bricks and a rubber tire, his pink face and pink bottom set off against the beef-gone-high grey of the cellar he appears to be locked inside of. An ''exceptionally obese hippopotamus trying to reassure itself that ''Fat is Fun'' juggles bonbons in a pink, blue, violet and coloradded orange arc. The bestiary includes four lions. Two of them are disheveled and rather neurasthenic monarchs. One is a ''feeble-minded circus lion basking in the belief that it is the King of Beasts.'' These three may have a special meaning for Searle's British audience, which finds itself no longer in the Twilight of Empire but in that sort of radioactive black light popular in the yobbo discos of Manchester. My own favorite, however, is the lion on the cover. He wears blue jeans and a T-shirt emblazoned, ''Hi, I'm Rex.'' He rules over a tubercular blue de Chirico desert adorned by a cow skeleton belly-up beneath a Club Med red sun hung low in the sky. He looks like the sort of infra-bohemian bore who hangs out in resort motel bars in Arizona. In any case, ''Hi, I'm Rex'' is Ronald Searle at the peak of his powers of line, design, color and wit, and his many loyal subjects in America and Britain, his Gideon's Army of the Samizdat, will be only too happy to pay him homage.

   "input": "PARIS, Feb. 10 2014 Jacques Chirac, the Mayor of Paris, appeared before a news conference today to explain why he is running for President in the April elections. ''I was not listened to,'' he said of his resignation in 1977 as President Valery Giscard d'Estaing's Prime Minister. ''In the years since, I have continued to make suggestions and I still was not listened to.'' Mr. Chirac, formerly a close associate of Mr. Giscard d'Estaing, is now the President's principal rival for the votes of the French right and center-right. He is the leader of the Assembly for the Republic, the latest institutional heir to the party that once assembled about General de Gaulle. This makes him the titular chief of France's Gaullists, but it is a fragile chieftainship over some fiercely divided tribes. The Gaullists reluctantly supported Mr. Giscard d'Estaing in 1974, largely at Mr. Chirac's urging, only to find that once in power the President proceeded to construct his own political following at their expense. Says He Has No Regrets ''Je ne regrette rien,'' Mr. Chirac, quoting Piaf, said at today's news conference when asked if he was sorry. Regrets or not, his 1974 support of Mr. Giscard d'Estaing earned him the prime ministership until the two split three years later. On the other hand, it led a number of senior Gaullists to accuse him of wrecking the party for the sake of personal ambition. This resentment, compounded by the poor showing of the Assembly for the Republic in the last parliamentary elections, has resulted in two other Gaullist candidacies. One of the rivals is another former Prime Minister, Michel Debre, who is running on a platform of scriptural faithfulness to de Gaulle's doctrines. The other is Marie-France Garaud, a witty, sharp-tongued aide to de Gaulle's successor, the late Georges Pompidou. Mr. Chirac briefly outlined his program today, saying he was in favor of tax cuts to encourage small business, and of a tough line toward the Soviet Union. In answer to some skeptical questioning, he insisted that he was confident of winning the elections. The skepticism stemmed from current polls that give him only 11 percent of the vote - or up to 17 percent should the two other Gaullists withdraw - against roughly 31 percent for Mr. Giscard d'Estaing and some 28 percent for Francois Mitterrand, the Socialist candidate. Nevertheless, Mr. Chirac intends to campaign hard, with the help of party machinery that is largely loyal to him. And there is an instability about the French electoral situation that allows for some interesting hedging to the general view that Mr. Giscard d'Estaing will probably win, and that if he loses to anyone it will be to Mr. Mitterrand. For one thing, Mr. Giscard d'Estaing's big lead in the polls has dwindled, and Mr. Mitterrand has gained strength. If the French electorate is thought of as divided into two large groups, with the right and center-right (Gaullists and Giscardists) on one side and the left and center-left (Communists and Socialists) on the other, the electoral strength of each side is not far from being even. In the second round of the 1974 elections, when all but the two leading candidates were eliminated, Mr. Giscard d'Estaing, supported by the Gaullists, defeated Mr. Mitterrand, supported by the Communists, by less than 2 percent. Bad Feeling on the Left There is considerable bad feeling between the Socialists and the Communists this time, and most political analysts believe that in the first round, at least, the two parties will remain separate, with the Socialists far outdrawing the Communists. On the right the barriers are much less distinct. There seems to be no particular ideological distinction between the Giscardist and Gaullist voters. Therefore, it is hypothesized that with Mr. Giscard d'Estaing's popularity sliding and with the possibility of Mr. Chirac making a strong campaign, many of the President's supporters, grown lukewarm, might switch. It is mostly Mr. Chirac's supporters who suppose this. Other analysts doubt that the President will slip so far, or that his Gaullist rival will gain so much. Nevertheless, with elections 10 weeks away, with the campaign only just started and already growing old, the political world here seems grateful for any uncertainty it can get.

   "input": "WASHINGTON 2014 When Ronald Reagan's Cabinet was first assembled, the similarities of the members - in age, in convictions, even in dress - were so remarkable that they seemed to some to blend into a faceless whole. Today the Cabinet is divided, on issues ranging from the embargo on grain shipments to the Soviet Union to the automobile industry's demand for limits on imports from Japan, and there is sometimes drama under the homogeneous surface. No one expected the Reagan team to be completely free of differences, of course. The question was always how well the President would keep his pledge that the Cabinet, not the White House staff, would carry the burden of his Administration. Two months into his term, he has erected one of the most elaborate structures of the modern Presidency to carry out the functions of ''Cabinet government.'' Senior aides say they are pleased, even though difficulties remain. Perhaps inevitably, the more conspicuous blowups have come in foreign policy. Behind-the-scenes backbiting seems to have stepped up, bringing a blunt repudiation last week by James S. Brady, the White House press secretary, of an earlier comment by a State Department official that the press had made too much of the turmoil in El Salvador. Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. was reportedly furious. In fact, he has often expressed annoyance at White House or Defense Department comments on matters of foreign affairs. But White House officials note that in the first weeks of his Presidency, Mr. Reagan and his Cabinet decided a slew of budget items and tax cuts with remarkable internal smoothness. And the ''Cabinet government'' superstructure has begun to be used successfully to review issues and settle disputes. (One measure of success is the lack of headlines: The participants have been satisfied that their views had been accommodated in some fashion.) The main feature of the structure, borrowed from the concept of corporate executive committees, is six Cabinet councils, each serving as a formal body for the debating and shaping of policy. They are the National Security Council, required by law, and councils on economic affairs, natural resources and environment, health and human resources, commerce and trade, and food and agriculture. Each is headed by a Cabinet member, but each has an executive secretary who is a member of the White House staff. Each also has a ''secretariat'' of staff members from the agencies and the White House. The man in charge of making it all work is Edwin Meese 3d, chief policy coordinator, assisted by James A. Baker 3d, chief of staff. With the use of a computer, the two have created a novel way of tracking issues as they filter through the council and secretariat structure. When an issue has come before the White House, but has not yet been passed on to the Cabinet, Mr. Baker's office assigns it a number along with the label ''SS,'' for Staff Secretary. If an issue has come before Mr. Meese's office, or before one of the Cabinet councils - but not the White House staff - it is assigned a different number, along with the label ''CA,'' for Cabinet Administration. If something is forwarded from a Cabinet council to the White House staff, it gets another number and the label ''CS.'' And if it goes from the White House staff to a Cabinet council, it gets still another number and the label ''SC.'' ''Our goal is to insure that everybody agrees on the facts and assumptions of a given issue before they start deciding the issue,'' said Craig Fuller, director of Cabinet administration at the White House. ''The Cabinet councils and secretariats are a way of using the staff to get all the options analyzed and all the relevant information digested before the issue goes to the Cabinet, where it will be discussed with the President.'' Since January, only 25 nonbudget issues have percolated through to formal discussion during a full Cabinet meeting of the sort favored by Mr. Reagan. When an issue reaches this exalted status, it is assigned yet another computer number and the label ''CM,'' for Cabinet Matter. Last week, for instance, Mr. Reagan presided over a vigorous give-and-take on CM-13: auto imports. Mr. Reagan's struggles to mesh the functions of the people around him spring from a simple fact. Every modern President has found that his Cabinet and his staff approached issues with different perspectives. Typically, an agency focuses more narrowly on the policy implications, whereas the staff juggles a much broader range of concerns, from politics to Congressional demands to how something will be viewed in the press. In the Reagan White House, for example, Richard V. Allen and Martin Anderson, the national security and domestic policy advisers, have carved out the role of making sure that the President lives up to his campaign promises. In his first week in office, Mr. Reagan held a Cabinet meeting almost every day. Soon Mr. Meese, among others, decided that improved staff work reduced the need. Now the Cabinet convenes only once a week, usually on Thursday afternoon. Mr. Reagan also meets once or twice a week with one of his Cabinet councils. White House officials agree that not all the bugs are out. Recently, for instance, Agriculture Secretary John R. Block got permission from Mr. Meese to briefly discuss farm legislation personally with the President. The discussion quickly veered into matters for which no staff preparation had been done. Mr. Meese reportedly sat squirming as it deteriorated into a lively ''bull session'' that was essentially a waste of the President's time. But the system ''worked'' recently, a White House official said, when it produced a lucid Cabinet debate between Energy Secretary James R. Edwards and David A. Stockman, the budget director, over Mr. Edwards's request for funds to help clean up the crippled Three Mile Island nuclear power plant and to purchase a reprocessing plant in Barnwell, S.C. Mr. Reagan listened intently and then took the prepared material home with him. He sided with Mr. Edwards on Three Mile Island and Mr. Stockman on Barnwell. ''The system isn't perfect,'' said one Reagan aide. ''But it's working better than many expected. Probably the main reason is that this is the system Reagan used in California, and he is determined to duplicate the success he felt he had. It helps that so many of us were with him then, so that we instinctively know how to make it function.'' Illustrations: photo portrait of Reagan Administration officials  ",

AD DIARY, C2 Occasionally Manhattan smells of its waters stale but salt and becomes again an island, graceful, with a history, with tiers of homesteads rounds of tents caves. That line drawn suddenly backward perhaps moves forward also as the steams and oils and dusts and all the dark decayings overwhelm the salt. Recently Laurie Werner of Manhattan was standing in the Duffy Square TKTS line, waiting to buy reduced-price theater tickets, when she made an important discovery. Here is her report: ''I searched my pockets, and realized that I had only $22. Just enough for two tickets in a theater's Siberia, but not enough if, for once, I was offered choice seats. That night - of course - the seats offered were in the front mezzanine, center; total: $23. I frantically began to hunt for change in my pockets. When I found none, I asked the TKTS clerk if he'd take a check for $1 or hold the tickets until I could find a cash machine. 'Take the tickets,' he said. 'Pay me back another night.' ''To pay him back - and also to buy myself dinner - I now had to find a cash dispenser. I walked for awhile and found only one available machine (a sign said it was out of order and 'Being Renovated to Provide Better Service'). I was only a half-hour away from curtain time - I had to meet my friend Kenny, for whom I'd bought the other ticket, in the theater lobby at 8 - and I was ravenous and agitated. I rushed into Molfeta's, a restaurant across the street from the theater. I offered my credit cards - which I saw they didn't take - I offered a personal check with 10 I.D.'s, and I offered my dishwashing services, which are hardly worth mentioning. The manager smiled and led me to a table. 'Eat,' he said. 'Pay me back another night.' ''And everyone says New Yorkers are so mean.'' TWO MORE (AUTHENTIC) REASONS WHY I AM NOT LEAVING NEW YORK THIS WEEK 1. Little old man, Hosing down the platform At Houston Street station. Mopping with a broom and whistling, ''Take the A Train.'' 2. Taxi driver Racing up Eighth, Vividly cursing all the way. !!* 00a6! c ! Reagan, Carter, Koch, Proxmire And even the Waldorf Astoria. His license I.D. says, ''Nathan Polite.'' It may cost 18 cents to mail a letter now, but at least one New Yorker thought she knew how to beat the price hike. As Jean Epes of the Bronx was serving on jury duty last week, one of the other jurors began discussing luncheon plans. ''So,'' she asked, ''who'll come with me to the Post Office after lunch? We should go there and buy up those 15-cent stamps, before they change the price on them!'' There was a long puzzled silence in the Federal Court jury room, says Mrs. Epes. POEM Poe. R.F. PEASE SOLITAIRE I live on a high floor of a building facing a busy avenue on the West Side of Manhattan. Across the street from me, a few floors down, at a window with a rather large windowsill, sits an elderly woman. She is playing cards by herself. She sits there all day long, from morning till evening, stopping only for brief moments during the day. Once I saw someone else moving about in the room behind her, but she seemed to pay no attention to whoever it was, and went on playing. This has been going on for at least six years. The other day I finally found myself satisfying my intense curiosity. I took a pair of binoculars over to the window, to see just what kind of game of solitaire she was so engrossed in. When her window came into focus, I saw that what she was shuffling and laying out was not a deck of cards, but a stack of photographs: they were the faded photographs of children.  ",

   "input": "PARIS, May 28 2014 The structure and implications of terrorism in Europe are changing. Foreboding undertones provoke memories of the terrible 1930's and require clear, cool reaction. The U.S. is not yet directly involved. But it is of the greatest importance not to be carried away by emotional charges and counter-charges of Soviet master plots that unnerve. In the last decade, terrorism was dominated by an anarchist mentality. Small groups of wild people kidnapped and killed to frighten society into paralyzed despair. West Germany's Baader-Meinhof gang and Italy's Red Brigades, for example, sought to provoke harsh and generalized repression that would in turn create a rebellious mood. They had no plans for the future, not even a vague outline of how they wanted the world to change, only the mad romantic belief that if they could bring states tumbling down, something they preferred might emerge from the ruins. Even Irish and Palestinian terrorists, Japanese, Armenians, Croats and others, murdered wantonly for ''the cause'' without any clear idea of how their crimes were supposed to advance their convictions. They wanted to attract attention and recruits, and force the release of prisoners so as to intimidate governments against further arrests. No doubt some of them received material help and training from Soviet-sponsored agencies. But they achieved revulsion. With the exception of Turkey, where rival extremists did undermine a civilian Government and brought military rule, they failed in their purpose of shredding the social fabric. Now there is a change of texture, and it is more serious. The new directions of conspiracy may be the first real success of terrorism. A certain collusion has developed between extremes of left and right in Europe. They are serving each other's interests in actually weakening governments whether or not there is deliberate cooperation, and in some cases there seems to be. The plots recently attempted and disclosed in Spain and Italy are of a quite different order from the terrorism of the 1970's. They are the work of cold-minded people who know what they want to do with society: milk it and rule with an iron hand. The rise of Fascism in Italy in the 1920's and the collapse of Germany's fragile Weimar Republic in the 1930's were promoted by the ends working violently against the middle, confusing the distraught majority. Mussolini, Hitler and Franco knew exactly what they wanted and they won, for a time. This is not to play Cassandra but to remember that the ravaging dictatorships could have been stopped if people had understood in time that identifying the enemy was not to choose one ideology against another but to resist all who oppose law and liberty. Distinctions between ''friendly authoritarians'' and ''hostile totalitarians,'' as would be made by Ernest Lefever, the nominee to run the State Department's human rights program, can do more damage to the cause of freedom than murderous gangs. The U.S. and the revived states of Western Europe have kept peace on this crucial continent not only through their military alliance but through their dedication to shared values. It is in the highest interest of the U.S. and the European Community to buttress those values and their proven representatives. There are some specific and concrete steps to take. And now is not too soon. For the U.S., what many Americans think should be taken for granted needs to be repeated clearly. It is that America can never have the good relations with tyrannies that it has with democracies. Spaniards thought they heard the opposite when Secretary of State Alexander Haig said of the February putsch in Madrid that it was an ''internal affair.'' They remembered that Washington led the way in helping Franco Spain out of its postwar international quarantine. Other Europeans, perhaps members of the sinister P-2 lodge in Italy, remembered that the 1967 colonels' coup in Greece was also tolerantly accepted by Washington. The U.S. is renegotiating its Spanish bases treaty. The way to show we understand the difference between partners and strange, if unavoidably strategic, bedfellows is to offer good terms to democratic Spain with a public caveat endorsed by the Senate that they will not apply should the regime be overthrown. That by itself would ''prevent the next coup,'' in the opinon of well-placed Western observers in Madrid. It would reverberate among Italian plotters too. France needs to stop its semi-indulgence of Basque terrorists who use its territory as a sanctuary in tacit return for not agitating the French Basques. There are better chances for this with the new French Government, and it is in America's interest too to encourage Paris to be firm. The conspirators in Italy and Spain don't want to be isolated from the West, but they risk miscalculating. Washington needs to set them straight quickly, before the hot and cold-eyed terrorist campaigns combine their destructive effect.  ",

The advent of this new place brings to the Upper West Side the sort of establishment that has been flourishing on the East Side, with To Catch a Rising Star and the Comic Strip, and on the farther-south West Side with the Improvisation, the grand-daddy of them all, on West 44th Street. City Lights is essentially a restaurant. The entertainment, segregated from the eating, takes place in a smaller, cozy back room where the tables put you within pointing range of the talent on the platform in the corner. During the evening, the comics come and go, like rush-hour trains, each unloading a cargo of routines, some clever, some downright funny, some clearly in need of developmental funds before they are ready for public consumption. There is a $5 cover Fridays and Saturdays, when the comics go on at 9 P.M. and midnight; $3 Sundays through Thursdays, when the show starts at 9 and just keeps going. Singers and improvisational types on Sundays, a showcase for aspiring comics on Mondays. No minimum ever. The backroom menu, light-eating items, runs from $2.50 to $5.25. Telephone: 580-1368. RETRO Louise Brooks was an American movie actress, of rare beauty, who left Hollywood to make movies in Europe. She is little-remembered now except for a coterie of fans who have rediscovered her and keep the memory of her greatness alive (as she herself is). Among her American films were ''Love 'Em and Leave 'Em'' in 1926 and ''Beggars of Life'' in 1928. It is perhaps fitting that the last film she starred in, the 1930 ''Prix de Beaute,'' should be the earliest movie in the ''Rediscovering French Film: Part I'' series now at the Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53d Street, where it will be screened at 2:30 P.M. today. Miss Brooks plays a Parisian typist, torn between her love for a linotype operator and a lust for fame. She was cast for the part by Rene Clair, who started to make the movie but was removed from the job and eventually replaced by Augusto Genina as director, although he is credited as one of the scriptwriters and, with G.W. Pabst, for the adaptation. At 6 P.M. the series offers ''Goupi Mains-Rouges'' (''It Happened at the Inn''), directed in 1943 by Jacques Becker. This film, made while German troops occupied France, is about a peasant family in ruthless search for a treasure on their land, nasty people all, with the meanest of the Goupis a caricature of Hitler. The films have English subtitles. Admission to the museum: $3; under-12's and over-65's, $1; students, $2; Tuesdays, pay-what-youwish. The museum is open from 11 A.M. to 6 P.M. Film information: 956-6100. THE EVENING AFTER You didn' t have enough last night and still want to go out?

There is a two-drink minimum (unless you have dinner) plus an $8 minimum for the shows at 11 P.M., and 12:30 and 2 A.M. both days. Drinks, about $2.75. Dinner main courses, $15 to $21. GRADUATE COURSE? ''Oh, Johnny,'' a new musical now previewing at the Players Theater, 115 Macdougal Street (254-5076), came out of an adulteducation course in which Paul Streitz, book and lyrics, and Gary Cherpakov, composer and co-lyricist, began it four years ago as a class project in a mu sical-comedy workshop at the New School. On its way to Of f Broadway, it had a 1979 showcase at the Off Center Theater under its current director, Alan Weeks, who was a performer in ''Ain't Mi sbehavin' '' and ''The Wiz.'' This show, set in the World War II South Pacific, is all new but frankly reminiscent, even down to a trio in the mold of the Andrews Sisters (they sing ''The Boogie Bug'').

China's economy grew an annual 7.0 percent in the second quarter, steady with the previous quarter and slightly better than analyst forecasts, though further stimulus is still expected after the quarter ended with a stock market crash. Given that we have seen stimulus , I would have expected some stabilization. GDP came in a tick better than expected, and at least showed no further deceleration, said analyst Dominic Schnider of UBS Wealth Management in Hong Kong. Industrial output figures did show an enormous pick up , floor space sold is turning positive. While one month doesn't make a trend, I think the base metals will take this as a positive. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange rose 0.6 percent to $5 ,597 a tonne by 0234 GMT after easing in the previous session. Last week, prices hit the weakest level in six years at $5,240 a tonne. Shanghai Futures Exchange copper also climbed half a percent. Industrial output growth quickened to 6.8 percent, surprising analysts who expected it to rise 6 percent on an annual basis after a rise of 6.1 percent the prior month. Floor area of property sold rose 3.9 percent from the year-earlier period. Analysts watch the indicator as a gauge of health in China's property market, a major driver of metals demand. Gains were contained however, as markets priced in that a lower scale of easing may be needed. China's main stock indexes fell over 2 percent. China's copper demand conditions remain fragile in mid-2015 but if the current equity market volatility is contained , then copper should be the metal best placed to rally, Standard Chartered said in a research note. LME nickel was up more than 1 percent and ShFE nickel rallied more than two percent at one point before paring gains. Wild swings continue , as some investors bet supply will tighten, while others see ample stockpiles in China. Standard Chartered said that low nickel prices, which hit a six month trough last week, are set to accelerate cuts in China's nickel pig iron sector, which should boost nickel demand from stainless mills. There remains ample inventory both in China and ex-China to solve the deficits projected over the next two years so unless we see some large production cuts to deepen those deficits , there is no impinging sense of scarcity.

It is potentially a policy error because the market will tighten for them , as is already happening to some degree. Investors are growing concerned about just such an error , he said. The VIX, which measures stock market volatility, jumped nearly 135 percent in August, its biggest monthly gain since 1990. China rocked markets last month after it devalued its currency, feeding fears that the country's leaders are losing confidence in their ability to hit economic targets and sending major U.S. averages into correction. Read More Weak China August factory, services point to further economic slowdown China's currency devaluation has been seen as a way to support flagging exports and bring the country in line with international standards. But the perception that it was also a bid to put off a Fed rate hike is feeding volatilty, as well, Timmer said. If you believe that the Chinese devalued the currency a few weeks ago in anticipation of a September liftoff , ... then the Chinese devalued to ward that off, he said. The market went into a tailspin , and then the odds of a September liftoff were greatly reduced to something like 20 percent and everything kind of got calm again. Higher interest rates would presumably increase the value of the dollar , which would also lift the greenback-linked yuan, making China's products more expensive to foreign buyers. If the Fed is going to go in September after all then it puts China back on the hot seat in terms of what it does with its currency , Timmer said. Should China continue to devalue its currency , it will feed deflation around the world, he added. That would put the Fed on hold because it would face a tougher time hitting its 2 percent inflation target.  ",

  "Definition": "You will be given a text and its summary. You need to categorise the summary into any of the 3 kinds - abstractive, mixed, and extractive. The summary description of the text is abstractive if it generates a shorter version of a given sentence while attempting to preserve its meaning. Abstractive summary can also be achieved through Sequence-to-sequence models with attention have been applied to various language tasks, including summarization. The process by which the model produces tokens is abstractive, as there is no explicit mechanism to copy tokens from the input text. If the summary is build by picking a sequence of sentences from the text with a maximum allowable length 50 words and these extracted text is then merged to form a summary, then summarisation is of category extractive. If a summary of a text build by direct extraction of text and then forming a abractive words resulting into a inference then it is categorised as mixed. The mixed summary unlike extraction summary contain less than 50% of direct extraction and rest of the words formed by abstraction.",

            "input": "text:Over the past few months, while Amazon, Microsoft and IBM took turns unveiling new cloud computing data centers in China, India, Germany, the U.K., South Korea, and elsewhere, one public cloud provider remained eerily silent: Google.  This is odd because, when it comes to delivering cloud services to customers 2014especially business customers 2014location matters. The further away the computer servers and storage are, the longer the lag time, or latency, in operations. And slow is definitely no good in this context.  But two sources close to Google GOOG said the company is considering an interesting plan.  Google 2019s cloud services operate out of four data center regions worldwide compared with 20 for Microsoft Azure and 11 for Amazon Web Services (AWS) with five more due in the next year. But Google also has 70 data caching stations around the world that store copies (or caches) of video, audio and popular web pages close to their likely audiences to speed their delivery.  Those endpoints are key pieces of what Google calls its  201cpeering and content delivery network. 201d The idea, which both sources said is under discussion, calls for these Google outposts to be outfitted with additional computing capacity so they would become sort of mini data centers.  Both sources requested anonymity because their companies work with Google. A Google spokeswoman would not comment on what she called rumor and speculation.  One source noted that the Google Compute Engine (GCE) team 2014basically the cloud group 2014is working with the company 2019s broader internal infrastructure groups to see if it can put small pods or clusters of computing power into these regional endpoints.  There could be wrinkles. For one thing this could end up being a tiered system, with big jobs running on Google 2019s own massive data centers which run hundreds of thousands (millions?) of servers that could outstrip the capabilities of the smaller end-point nodes of the CDN. If they were to do that, there 2019s more limited capacity than for the stuff running in GCE 2019s own data centers, he said.   201cUsers might be given a cap and it would be more expensive to run 201d in these smaller clusters, the source said.  That scenario flies in the face of the expectation of public cloud users 2014customers who rent out computing, storage and bandwidth run by Google, Amazon, Microsoft etc. 2014who think they can add nearly unlimited computing and storage capacity as needed. So this scenario could set up a two sets of infrastructure with two pricing models.  But it is clear Google needs to do something about global coverage soon. Amazon AMZN is the leader in public cloud infrastructure, running what Gartner last year estimated to be 10 times more computing capacity than the next 14 cloud competitors combined. Microsoft MSFT is making a play especially with business customers.  To help speed traffic flow into and out of its cloud, Google and Akamai [Fortune-stock symbol= 201dAKAM 201d], the CDN market leader recently announced a partnership to directly link to Google 2019s own CDN interconnect with Akamai 2019s CDN. In September it announced a similar deal with four other CDN providers: Cloudflare, Fastly, Level 3 Communications and Highwinds. But those deals are just a piece of the overall puzzle.  Google has great technical smarts, and entered the fray with a bang last year with a series of price cuts on key storage and computing services in a move that seemed to flummox Amazon, which is not used to other companies driving the price agenda. But it has struggled to sell its cloud to business users, many of whom are not totally sure that Google, the online search and ad giant, really cares about cloud services. (For the record, it always said it does.)  To counter that perception, Google recently put former VMware VMW CEO Diane Greene in charge of its cloud unit. She brings added credibility to the push with business customers. (Of course, this week 2019s snafu with Google App Engine, anohter of Google 2019s cloud offerings, probably won 2019t help its case with prospective business users, but then again AWS and Azure have also had hiccups.)  Adrian Cockcroft, technology fellow at Battery Ventures, and former cloud guru at Netflix NFLX , said he has not heard about this Google plan but he that it would make sense given businesses needs for lots of geographical coverage and fast performance.  If the Google cloud team has figured out how to convert those CDN nodes into far-flung mini-data center pods, it means they have listened to what enterprise customers have requested, Cockcroft told Fortune via email.   201cFrom a technology point of view, it also means they have figured out how to scale down and package their cloud for small regional deployments, 201d Cockcroft said. That is something Microsoft and Digital Ocean, another public cloud company, have already done and something he thinks AWS will get better with over time.

            "input": "text:The European Union has long been the target of scorn from American conservatives. It is not hard to see why. Its regulatory bent infuriates free marketeers; its claim to have secured the peace in Europe annoys the partisans of NATO, which has a much better claim; and its quest for  201cever closer union 201d threatens to undermine national sovereignty and democratic accountability. Add to this the EU 2019s well-publicized travails over its common currency, the euro, and you have the makings of a profound antipathy.  Dalibor Rohac, a Slovak-born European conservative who is affiliated with the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, shares many of these concerns.  201cTowards an Imperfect Union 201d arrives at an especially fraught moment, when Britain is about to vote on whether to remain in the EU and when the European Union itself is riven by a migrant crisis and deepening concerns about Greek debt. Even so, Mr. Rohac asks conservatives to look again at the EU, for whose survival he makes a compelling case.  The author begins by reminding us that the Austrian economist Friedrich von Hayek, an icon to free-market conservatives on both sides of the Atlantic, was a strong supporter of European unity.  201cWhat we need . . . , 201d Hayek wrote in 1944,  201cis a superior political power which can hold the economic interests in check. 201d Hayek thought that open markets were a necessary result of political federation, as were  201cthe abrogation of national sovereignties, 201d as he wrote in a 1939 essay. But he was also thinking militarily:  201cThe main purpose of interstate federation, 201d he wrote,  201cis to secure peace: to prevent war between the parts of the federation 201d and to deter  201cany danger of attack from without. 201d  Securing the peace, Mr. Rohac argues, is exactly what the EU tries to do today. It is true that NATO should take much of the credit for keeping the Soviet Union at bay. But the European Union 2014in its current form and in its pre-1993 precursors, like the European Economic Community 2014has reduced internal tensions in Western and Central Europe and played a crucial role in the democratic transformation of Eastern Europe and the Balkans after the collapse of communism.  The EU, Mr. Rohac says, should be judged not against some Anglo-American libertarian idea but in the context of the historical weakness of mainland Europe. The dangers of untrammeled sovereignty were demonstrated by the nationalist and totalitarian excesses of the 20th century. In any case, the conservative Euroskeptic goal of a continent of free-trading sovereign states seems unlikely. Just look, Mr. Rohac says, at current trends in European politics, with the rise of populist, nationalist parties: the French National Front, the German Alternative f 00fcr Deutschland and the ruling Fidesz Party in Hungary. Besides, Mr. Rohac notes, the European Union 2019s regulatory fervor has largely been devoted to removing barriers to the movement of goods and labor, not to building barriers.  Britain, Mr. Rohac concedes, is an exceptional case. Uniquely among Europeans,  201cBritons might easily imagine a peaceful, democratic, and prosperous future outside the EU. 201d One reason is that the United Kingdom 2014and, before it was formed, England 2014has enjoyed 1,000 years of more or less unbroken constitutional development, with only brief foreign invasions. Britain was a victor power in both world wars. Unlike the rest of the continent, Britain had no problem that the European project was designed to fix. That said, a precipitate British departure after a  201cno 201d vote in this week 2019s referendum would destabilize Europe and thus hurt the United Kingdom in other ways.  Sometimes Mr. Rohac overstates his case. Understandably keen to stress unforeseen dangers, he argues 2014against the evidence of the international war-crimes tribunal 2014that nobody planned the wars in Yugoslavia. On other occasions, he tends toward understatement or lack of ambition. He dismisses as unrealistic the idea of a full political union for continental Europe, even though a full union is the one way of solving the many challenges that Europe has set for itself by having adopted a common currency, a common foreign policy and a shared passport-less travel zone. His own proposals involve tinkering around the edges of current arrangements 2014for example, allowing member states to trade refugee quotas or replacing the national-border forces of frontline countries like Italy and Greece with a pan-European body.  Given that Europeans have routinely relied on the United States to rescue them during times of crisis 2014and the unlikelihood of their being able to get themselves out of the current mess unaided 2014it would have been good to see Mr. Rohac call for greater American engagement on the continent. Historically, Washington was a strong supporter of European political integration and was closely involved in the early stages of the project. As recently as Bill Clinton 2019s presidency, the U.S. coordinated the eastern enlargement of NATO with that of the European Union. Barack Obama, by contrast, announced a  201cpivot 201d to Asia and appeared to seek a  201creset 201d with Russia, at the expense of commitments to the security of Eastern Europe. He has had to row back recently, but there is still scope for a much greater American role in resolving the European crisis. Mr. Rohac misses an opportunity by not spelling out this crucial role.  Still,  201cTowards an Imperfect Union 201d mounts a formidable defense of the rationale of the European project. Mr. Rohac also makes a powerful metaphysical argument for maintaining the union. Conservatives tend to be skeptical of radical and irreversible change. The consequences of breaking up the European Union are not foreseeable and could very well be unpleasant. Stepping into the unknown in this way, Mr. Rohac concludes, is not something that any true conservative should be doing.  Mr. Simms is the author of  201cEurope: The Struggle for Supremacy, From 1453 to the Present. 201d Summary: Brendan Simms reviews Dalibor Rohac 2019s  201cTowards an Imperfect Union: A Conservative Case for the EU. 201d",

            "input": "text:Finn was an easy baby, said his mom, Meg Murphy.  He'd play on a blanket with one little toy for hours.  We just thought he was really laid back,  Murphy, a mother of three from Downingtown, Pennsylvania, told CBS News.  Her antennae started going up when she and her husband Billy noticed changes with Finn's language. He had started using normal baby words such as  mama,   dada  and  babba,  but then he stopped.   They faded out over time. He would start flapping his hands when he was excited. He wouldn't look when you called his name,  she said. They thought he might have hearing problems because he'd had ear infections.  After trouble-shooting with an ear, nose, and throat specialist, tests came back normal on Finn's hearing. He was also checked for seizure issues and cleared. Meg's mom, who had worked in schools over the years, suggested that there may be developmental issues, but Murphy said she brushed the concerns aside, and was actually a little irritated at the suggestion.   I remember at that time that our pediatrician wasn't concerned. He was like, all kids mature at different rates. But our family members, and my mom in particular, said this wasn't normal,  said Murphy.  Finally, to be thorough, they asked their pediatrician for a referral to early intervention services -- state services that can help evaluate or provide special education or therapies and other support to families with children who have disabilities or delays.   They come to your house -- a child development specialist and a speech therapist -- and they just tried to play with him. He was 14 months old. We thought we were just checking off a box. But at that visit, he didn't want to have anything to do with any of it. He couldn't play with the toys the right way. He didn't want to be with new people,  she said.  Finn scored very low on all of the assessments.   I remember being really devastated,  Murphy recalled, but she said it was also a dawning: she realized she needed to harness resources to help her son.  Finn Murphy, pictured at age 4, was diagnosed with autism when he was 17 months old. Close  Speech, occupational and physical therapy began for Finn, for an hour every week.   They worked with him individually and also taught me how to engage Finn and how to work with him. Before, I'd leave him to play nearby me on his own while doing dishes or other things but because of early intervention, I realized that I really had to get down in his face. He hated it. I remember trying to get him to do puzzles, putting big plastic coins in a plastic bank, playing with shape sorters. I have two other kids now, too, and they just love to pick up toys and do it on their own. We had to teach Finn to do it hand over hand, and give him lots of breaks,  she explained.  A formal diagnosis came when Finn was about 17 months old, through doctors at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, where the family now visits every six months to check in with autism experts.  When Murphy was newly pregnant with her second child, and Finn wasn't yet two, genetic tests came back showing Finn had two markers for autism.  Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Finn's condition, is a neurodevelopmental disorder whose causes are still unclear. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 1 in every 68 children in the U.S. has autism. A government survey out late last year suggests the condition may be even more common than that. More boys than girls are diagnosed with autism, the hallmarks of which include ongoing social and communication impairments, and repetitive behaviors or activities. The word  spectrum  refers to the fact that there not a single snapshot of what's normal for autism, but a range of severity and behaviors in children.   Forty years ago, our definition of autism was different. It was less inclusive. It wasn't that autism didn't exist, it was just viewed differently,  Leandra Berry, a pediatric neuropsychologist and associate director of clinical services for the Autism Center at Texas Children's Hospital, told CBS News.  Berry said she's diagnosed children as young as 14 months. Sometimes, though, a diagnosis doesn't come until years or even decades later.  Really there's no upper age limit. People are getting diagnosed even as adults,  she said.   The younger a child is diagnosed the better, said Dr. Patricia Manning-Courtney, director of The Kelly O'Leary Center for ASD, and a professor of pediatrics in the Division of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center.  However, there is controversy over whether all young children should be screened for autism, or only those whose parents or doctors raise concerns about their development.  In a statement published in the Journal of the American Medical Association this week, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force said there's insufficient evidence to show that universal screening for autism spectrum disorder in all kids ages 18 to 30 months old is justified.  The task force is an independent panel made up of volunteer experts that makes recommendations about certain preventive care services including screenings, counseling services, and medications. The group's statement pointed out that no study has directly compared the long-term outcomes of children who received screening with those who didn't, and that research showing the effectiveness of early autism treatment has not been based on cases identified through screening.  A commentary in JAMA Pediatrics by Duke autism expert Geraldine Dawson noted that the president of the American Academy of Pediatrics said the task force's recommendations  run counter  to the academy's 2006 recommendation to screen all children for autism at ages 18 and 24 months. Dawson said that screening leads to earlier referral and diagnosis.   The current guidelines that encourage universal autism screening offer the best chance for individuals with ASD to reach their full potential and lead productive lives. We should, therefore, stay the course while continuing to advance our knowledge about the full impact of autism screening,  she wrote.  An editorial in JAMA Psychiatry criticized the task force as well for its  non-recommendation.    We hope that the USPSTF statement does not trigger a step backward to later diagnosis, later treatment, and more disparity in services for children with ASD,  wrote Dr. Jeremy Veenstra-VanderWeele of the Sackler Institute for Developmental Psychobiology, Department of Psychiatry, at Columbia University, and Dr. Kelly McGuire of with the Center for Autism and Developmental Disorders, Maine Behavioral Healthcare, in Portland.  Berry told CBS News that autism screening at a typical  well child  checkup does not carry any risks, and does not involve any special procedures -- there's no MRI or blood tests, for example. It requires a brief parent questionnaire that takes five or ten minutes to complete, which is good at identifying children who need further assessment for autism or other developmental conditions that may have similar early symptoms, she said.  Manning-Courtney said,  I've never seen a family resent or regret going through this process. I've seen families appreciate being attentive to these issues. And often these families are relieved.   What's important is that parents make a connection very early with a child who might have autism or other developmental issues, she said. If the screening raises red flags, children would next visit with a specialist like herself.   We give a combination medical exam, and psychological and speech language evaluation,  she explained.  If a child is diagnosed, Manning-Courtney said they can benefit from starting the needed therapies sooner.   They get resources sooner. Families get everything they can get sooner. At a professional level, its much easier, too, if I know a child from a young age on versus picking them up from age five or seven,  she said.  It's better to start the conversation sooner and get children into therapy sooner rather than later.   Finn's mom said she's glad she followed her instincts and pursued answers early, as hard as it was initially to face the knowledge that he had autism. The information led to early interventions for Finn, which she believes benefitted him and their whole family.  On Finn's third birthday, he started full-day preschool where he received autism support classes. Another big step, after weighing the pros and cons with their education and medical experts, was adding medication to his plan. He recently started a very low dose of Risperdal, for anxiety and irritability, said Murphy.  It was a difficult decision, she said, but the right one.  It's been huge for him. Aside from getting his own full-time aide in school, starting the medicine was the best thing for him. It helps him visibly. He's more comfortable in his own skin. It took down a wall. It helps him sleep at night, which was huge for us. He would be up at all hours of the night and that would affect his day. And it doesn't make him sleepy during the day,  said Murphy.  Her second son, now two-and-a-half, received a complete evaluation for autism at 13 months, and he did not have any signs of the condition. Her six-month-old daughter hasn't been evaluated for autism yet, but is developing well, Murphy said.   I know so many other moms who are scared to know. Or they say, 'He'll catch up or grow out of it.' For us, it was so important that we put our parental pride aside and made sure that we were giving Finn the best opportunity for help early on,  she said.  For many families, the cost of such treatments can be a difficult burden. Sheletta Brundidge, a Houston mom of four who has two toddlers with autism, said speech and behavioral services add up.  But you can't cut out therapies your child needs, she explained.  If your child has autism, therapy once a week for 30 minutes is not enough,  she said.  The Brundidge Family: Shawn, Andrew (9), Sheletta, Brandon (in front), Cameron (on lap). Brandon and Cameron both have autism. Close  Brundidge told CBS News autism can bankrupt even educated, well-off middle class families. But many parents don't realize that there are grants available to families who don't have access to free or affordable autism support services in their communities or health insurance that covers all of their child's needs, she said.  To help other families, Brundidge volunteers her time, providing local seminars for parents who want to learn about autism funding opportunities.  Murphy's son Finn, now almost five, is considered severely autistic. He doesn't talk and is not potty trained. But he now communicates in his own way, his mom said. He uses YouTube videos -- Sesame Street and Disney sing-a-longs -- that he shows her to tell her if he's hot or hungry, for example.   He has them memorized and can play certain bits of other peoples' conversations to communicate,  Murphy said.  Murphy said she's learned a lot by reading blogs by older autistic children who don't speak but can type, which allows them to  talk  online.   This handful of kids learned how to type and can express everything now. Through them, they have been a window. A lot of these older kids whose blogs I read ask why are researchers not researching that?  Murphy said.  She holds hope that Finn will one day be able to express himself through typing, too.  Finn has also participated in ski boarding camp for kids with autism, horseback riding, and youth soccer, where he gets his own teenage buddy.   He's gotten a lot better. What I'd say to other parents is not to be scared of the limitations that a diagnosis can imply. But instead to learn to see your child as a really different individual who is just as intelligent and special as every other kid, but just displays and learns and communicate differently,  Murphy said.  Murphy feels that all children should be screened for autism at 18 and 24 months.   While our Finn displays more 'classically autistic' traits that would make it less likely for him to slip through the diagnostic cracks, there are many kids on the spectrum who don't display obvious autistic behavior, or are better at 'passing' as typical. Girls especially. This group of kids could really greatly benefit from early diagnosis. For obvious reasons like access to educational supports and therapies, but also for less obvious and equally important reasons -- like building self esteem and self awareness skills.

Trouble is, most of the time, there can be only one winner. And in the midsize sedan segment, that winner is the Honda Accord.  Sorry Toyota. While you actually move more Camrys out the door, the reality is that lots of them end up in rental, government, and taxi fleets. Honda sells Accords to individual customers, making it America 2019s clear choice as its favorite family car.  FOLLOW DAILY NEWS AUTOS ON FACEBOOK. 'LIKE' US HERE.  Last year, among Asian brands, the Nissan Altima was the third best-selling midsize car. Among American brands, the Chevrolet Malibu trailed the Ford Fusion, just squeaking by the faltering Chrysler 200.  Both Chevrolet and Nissan aspire to greater success with consumers and reduced reliance on what are known as  201cfleet sales 201d to keep the factories running. They don 2019t want to be runners-up. Chevy redesigned the Malibu for 2016, and it is a clear improvement over the car it replaces. Nissan has refreshed the Altima for 2016, refining a vehicle that already delivered compelling value.  To find out which car is most compelling as an alternative to the best sellers in the segment, I gathered loaded examples of each and compared them side-by-side. Given the Malibu 2019s complete redesign, you might not find the result surprising. What is surprising, though, is that the Chevy narrowly took the win despite its stylish design, advanced technologies, and more powerful engine.  When requesting the vehicles for this comparison, knowing that the top-of-the-line Malibu Premier has a turbocharged 2.0-liter engine making 250 horsepower, I asked Nissan to bring an Altima 3.5 SL, the one with the excellent 260-horsepower, 3.5-liter V6 engine. They didn 2019t have one of those. Instead, we settled on the less expensive 2.5 SL.  For 2016, Nissan has tweaked the Altima 2019s styling, adding more dramatic boomerang lighting elements, a new grille, and new aluminum wheel designs. More importantly, the Altima 2019s underlying structure is stronger for improved crash safety, and Nissan offers new driver assistance and collision avoidance technologies in addition to NissanConnect Services with automatic collision notification. Revised steering, suspension, and transmission calibrations improve driving dynamics, and a sport-tuned SR model debuts. Unfortunately, the SR is unavailable with many of the upgrades that make the Altima more appealing for 2016.  Compared to the Malibu Premier, and especially when viewed in profile, the Altima 2.5 SL looks rather drab, which simply draws more attention to its inelegant facelift. Mainly, I dislike the way that the headlights lap like a wave into the fenders and hood. Additionally, the oversized grille is better suited to an SUV than a passenger car. The new rear styling is tidy, and the larger 18-inch wheels offered on SR and 3.5 SL models help to add visual spice.  Inside, Altimas with a beige and black interior provide sharp contrast for a more upscale look. From the attractive perforated leather to the leaf-pattern plastic trim, my Altima 2019s cabin looked and felt like it belonged in a more expensive vehicle, except for windshield pillar covers oddly devoid of any texture whatsoever.  Comfort is an Altima hallmark, thanks to the roomy cabin and Nissan 2019s outstanding  201cZero Gravity 201d seat designs. If you 2019re not driving, you might even prefer to ride in the back seat, which provides lots of legroom, terrific thigh support, and a perfect backrest angle. The front passenger 2019s seat lacks a height adjuster, which is one reason I preferred sitting in the back.  Controls are laid out in logical fashion, and the Altima boasts large, legible instrumentation, clearly marked switchgear, and simple knobs and buttons for the most commonly used functions. Storage areas are generously sized, and the 15.4 cu.-ft. trunk supplies a handle on the inner lid to help the car 2019s owner to swing it shut without getting dirty fingertips.  Nissan wisely introduces its new NissanConnect Services subscription plan for the 2016 Altima. With a paid plan, it supplies automatic collision notification, easy access to emergency and roadside assistance calling, and features aimed at promoting safer driving in teenagers such as speed, curfew, and boundary alerts. Unfortunately, it is restricted to the SL trim level, which is shortsighted.  Similarly, the Altima 2019s new predictive forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking systems are offered only for the most expensive SL trim. Given that these technologies are proven to reduce accidents, and that you can get them on any version of the best-selling Honda Accord, Nissan 2019s decision to offer it only on the priciest Altima is disappointing.  If a collision does occur, though, structural changes made for 2016 help the Altima to get top marks from the federal government and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS).  Nissan has some catching up to do in terms of its infotainment technology, too. My test car had the top version of NissanConnect with Mobile Apps, featuring a 7-inch touchscreen. While pairing an iPhone to the system proved easy, and though it offers Siri Eyes Free and text-messaging support, it certainly looked and felt dated compared to the more sophisticated Chevrolet MyLink technology in the Malibu.  Thanks to its upgraded steering, suspension, and transmission, the Altima is more enjoyable to drive for 2016. The 182-horsepower, 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine is reliable and efficient, paired with an updated continuously variable transmission that now sounds and feels more like a traditional automatic. While the Altima would no doubt have been more fun to drive with its optional V6 engine and the larger 18-inch wheels that accompany it, it also would not have returned an impressive 31.9-mpg on my test loop.  While Nissan has fine-tuned the Altima 2019s electric steering, it still isn 2019t right, and especially when compared to the Malibu. When the cars are driven back-to-back, the Altima 2019s steering feels disconnected and vague on center, making it hard to execute fine-tuned course corrections, and is slower off-center. The leather Nissan uses on the steering wheel is also less satisfying to grip.  As far as ride and handling are concerned, the Altima proves stable, sure-footed, and predictable at all times. What 2019s missing here is dynamism, something to make the driver feel that the Altima is more than just a conveyance designed to get from Point A to Point B. While the new Altima SR models deliver that, they also can 2019t be optioned with desirable equipment, underscoring the limitations imposed upon consumers with regard to mixing and matching the best of what this car has to offer.  Perhaps more than anything, such limitations possess the power to restrict interest in the Altima. Until Nissan provides its customers with a better range of choice, the ability to buy a car that they might actually want, the company will continue to field a runner-up in the midsize sedan segment.  According to J.D. Power, consumers claim that styling is just as important as reliability when it comes to choosing a new car. If that 2019s true, then the redesigned 2016 Chevrolet Malibu should find lots of success.  This car looks much better in person than it does in pictures, the light playing off of its deceptively seductive bodywork and uncommonly cohesive detailing. Attention to detail gives the Malibu a look all its own, one that is appealing from any angle. The car is more aerodynamic, too, equipped with a deep front air dam that irritatingly scrapes on just about every dip and driveway apron.  Open the driver 2019s door, and Chevy 2019s flair for design remains evident, though the Malibu 2019s cabin is rendered in obviously inexpensive materials. Plus, my test vehicle 2019s Dark Atmosphere and Medium Gray interior lacked contrast, further cheapening the Chevy 2019s appearance.  Sophisticated infotainment screen graphics and understated ambient lighting help to ameliorate the budget-motel ambience, and then you open the door to exit the car and your heel catches on the rubber stripping that has come unmoored from the Malibu 2019s side sills. Clearly, this is no Nissan Altima SL.  Comfort levels are not as high as in the Nissan, either, especially for rear seat occupants. Though the new Malibu is bigger inside than before, compared to the Nissan it remains a bit cramped and claustrophobic in back. Front seats are better, equipped with 8-way power adjustment as well as heating and ventilation. But they 2019re not nearly as soothing as what Nissan supplies inside the Altima.  While rear seat room is improved compared to the previous Malibu, Chevy has shrunk its redesigned family sedan 2019s trunk, from 16.3 cu.-ft. to 15.8 cu.-ft. Additionally, even on the top-of-the-line Premier model, you need to put your hand on the outside of the trunk lid in order to slam it shut, so carry hand sanitizer inside the car.  Of course, that 2019s going to take up precious room. Stingy storage space is another fault with the new Malibu, from cup holders apparently designed by Big Gulp-hating Michael Bloomberg to a console storage tray with a USB port that can 2019t hold an iPhone 6 flat. Chevrolet provides a wireless smartphone charging slot that tightly grips your device, but if you sit far back in the seat track the forward edge of the center storage armrest blocks it from view. I kept forgetting my phone, leaving it inside of the car.  By now, you might be wondering how the Malibu won this contest. In addition to styling, its victory is due largely to its impressive infotainment system, useful if somewhat unrefined driver assistance technologies, and its superior driving dynamics.  Chevrolet's latest MyLink infotainment system is graphically pleasing, user-friendly, and responds quickly to inputs. Additionally, the 8-inch capacitive touchscreen successfully resisted fingerprints during a week and nearly 600 miles of driving. A tuning knob to complement the existing power and volume knob sure would be nice, but that 2019s the only complaint to voice about the system.  Furthermore, MyLink 2019s associated features are undeniably impressive. They include OnStar subscription services with automatic collision notification, an available 4G LTE Wi-Fi connection, Tune Select alerts for songs and artists playing on other stations, and smartphone projection technology in the form of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Optional for Malibu LT and standard for Malibu Premier, Teen Driver technology provides parents the ability to program speed and stereo volume limits and delivers driving reports each time your kid borrows the family car.  Like the Altima, the Malibu is available with a blind spot warning system, and because Chevrolet places the visual warning on the mirror, where the driver is already looking, instead of on the interior trim near the mirror, its solution is superior.  Additionally, Chevrolet makes important collision avoidance technology available on a broader array of Malibu models. That 2019s terrific, but the forward collision warning system 2019s frighteningly shrill visual and audible alert has the power to startle a driver into overreacting to a potential threat and actually causing an accident. I strongly recommend lowering the system 2019s sensitivity level.  On second thought, perhaps the collision warning system 2019s activity reflected the greater driver confidence that the Malibu Premier instilled in me. With few exceptions, this Chevrolet impresses in terms of its acceleration, steering, braking, ride, and handling qualities.  Whoosh! With 250 horsepower at 5,300 rpm and 260 lb.-ft. of torque available from 2,000 to 5,000 rpm, the Malibu Premier 2019s turbocharged 2.0-liter 4-cylinder delivers rapid acceleration. Under light throttle, the 8-speed automatic upshifts quickly to conserve fuel, but when you need to accelerate onto a freeway, pass slower traffic, or power up a mountain grade, the Malibu hustles.  Better yet, when equipped with its sizable 19-inch aluminum wheels, the Malibu sticks in corners, the suspension tuned to provide a compliant ride combined with a genuinely tossable nature when the road starts to twist and turn. On undulating pavement, the rather short tire sidewalls contribute to an unexpectedly stiff and busy ride quality, but this car is undeniably enjoyable to drive.  No doubt, the Malibu 2019s perfectly tuned electric steering plays a big role in this regard. Quick, accurate, and delivering the on-center precision necessary to accurately make minor steering corrections, the steering is light and effortless at low speeds and feels perfectly precise the faster you drive.  Though the Malibu Premier encourages enthusiastic driving, it still returns decent fuel economy. The EPA says it should get 26 mpg in combined driving, but on my Malibu, California test loop the car got 27.4 mpg.  Taken together, the Malibu 2019s driving dynamics, modern infotainment and safety technologies, and appealing design allow it to score slightly ahead of Nissan 2019s refreshed Altima, which supplies a superior interior design with better materials and incomparably comfortable seating.  Unfortunately, the Chevy 2019s stylish but comparatively low-rent interior demonstrates that perhaps General Motors still doesn 2019t understand how important it is to spend money inside of a vehicle where owners spend all of their time. This, combined with the imminent arrival of a refreshed Ford Fusion, could keep Chevrolet from advancing beyond the 50-yard line on the competitive midsize sedan battlefield.

            "input": "text:A premium luxury sedan born from the ashes of the Fisker Karma  2013 a Tesla rival that wowed the automotive world before collapsing into bankruptcy three years ago  2013 will soon begin rolling off a production line at California's newest car factory.  When it is up and running, the Karma Automotive factory in Moreno Valley will produce as many as 3,000 of the high-end Karma Reveros annually. The cars, again compteting with Tesla, will be four-door luxury electric sedans priced above $100,000.  Karma Automotive joins Tesla on a list of locally based car and bus manufacturers, including Faraday Future, BYD and Atieva that together are making California ground zero for the electric vehicle market.  Like those companies, Karma is backed by Chinese money. The bankrupt Karma 2019s assets were purchased in 2014 by Wanxiang Group, a Chinese auto parts giant that also owns A123, the battery company that produced power packs for the Fisker cars.  Faraday, which recently announced its plan to build cars at a $1-billion facility in Nevada and another smaller factory in the San Francisco area, is owned by Chinese entrepreneur Jia Yueting. Atieva, a Silicon Valley-based electric car company, is controlled by the Chinese state-owned Beijing Automotive Industry Corp. BYD, which employs 160 workers at a plant in Lancaster that builds electric buses, is owned by the Chinese BYD Auto Co.  On a recent weekday morning, inside a massive, anonymous warehouse just east of the March Air Reserve Base in Riverside County, bits and pieces of aluminum-bodied cars moved slowly along broad conveyor belts.  In one area, welders behind heavy masks were being trained to turn rectangular sections of metal into a working chassis. Across the way, 15-foot-tall robots were using rivets to join the frame sections to body parts. Further down the production line, car bodies that had been dipped in paint tanks were baking in a super-heated drying oven.  Technicians wearing hard hats and goggles watched the welders and robots, fine-tuning their efforts, making sure the practice vehicles were up to premium luxury automotive standards.  When they're done, the Reveros will look and drive a lot like their predecessor Karmas. Though the new car will have its own front and rear fascia design, it will be powered by the same engine and same A123 battery, and contain many of the Karma 2019s interior and exterior design elements, as the car built by honored designer Henrik Fisker.  That car had a combined 400-plus horsepower and 960 pound feet of torque, and a top speed of 125 miles per hour. It could travel about 50 miles on electric charge alone, and 230 miles using its combined gasoline and electric power trains.  Sleek and low-slung, the Karma won Automobile Magazine's Design of the Year award in 2011, and was named Luxury Car of the Year for 2011 by Top Gear Magazine.   201cThe Karma was loved and revered, 201d said Jim Taylor, the energetic auto veteran who, after decades with General Motors, is now Karma's chief marketing officer.  201cThey nailed the design. You 2019d be crazy to change it. 201d  Taylor and a Karma team scouted factories and courted governmental assistance in Tennessee, Texas, Indiana, South Carolina, Michigan and other locations before settling on Moreno Valley.  In the end, Taylor said, it was location more than hand-outs than lured Karma to California. While other states offered cash and tax incentives, Southern California offered the good weather and cultural amenities that help lure the best engineers and designers.  Even a low-volume car factory requires an enormous footprint. Karma 2019s Moreno Valley facility has 32-foot ceilings and occupies 550,000 square feet. When full production begins, 100 workers will build cars here, in addition to 600 other employees at Karma 2019s Costa Mesa design offices and as many as 150 more engineering and sales staff in an office in Troy, Mich.  Building the factory, inside an existing warehouse, involved complications. A fully-functioning production line was among the assets orphaned by the Fisker bankruptcy. But the assets were still in the shuttered Fisker Scandinavian factory.  See the most-read stories in Business this hour  00bb   201cThe good news is that we 2019ve got it, 201d Taylor said he was told.  The bad news is  2013 it's in Finland. 201d  The Finnish production line was broken down into parts, boxed and sent by ship to the U.S., then brought by train to California, where it was reassembled inside the Moreno Valley warehouse.  Also in the Fisker inventory were 120 finished Karma cars, and parts and pieces to build dozens more  2013 though these too were scattered between factory, warehouses, dealerships and parts suppliers, and were in what Taylor called  201cvarying degrees of rust and disrepair. 201d  Those bits were all shipped to California, and became the test vehicles Karma would use to train its workers and robots to make new cars. Some will become crash test vehicles. Others will be scrapped. Still others might actually become new Reveros.  When they are for sale, Taylor said, the first vehicles may go to people who still own their original Karmas.   201cThere are 1,300 owners in the U.S. who are fanatics, 201d Taylor said.  201cThey want to have the first crack, and there should be a way to do that. 201d  Taylor said that what goes around doesn 2019t necessarily have to come around, and that Karma will not be forced to make the mistakes its predecessor car company made  2013 which he said included having to put cars into the market, in order to satisfy investor demands, when they weren't ready to sell   201cWe have no pressure that this car has to be in showrooms by Thanksgiving, 201d Taylor said.  201cWe 2019ll reveal the car this summer, and the pricing. 201d  Even at this late date, in fact, Taylor said the company has not decided whether its distribution system will be modeled on the Detroit tradition, selling cars through franchised dealerships, or go Tesla-style, selling cars direct to the consumer. Karma 2019s solution might be a little of both, Taylor said, or might vary region to region.  Stressing that the Moreno Valley factory investment underscores Karma 2019s parent company 2019s long-term commitment to building electric vehicles, Taylor said Wanxiang 2019s founder and president, Lu Guanqui  2013 said to be worth $6.5 billion, and to be the 18th richest person in China  2013 is no short-term flipper.   201cAsian companies are taking the long view, 201d Taylor said.  201cThis is a mission in his mind, for his kids, and for their kids. 201d  Karma Automotive 2019s owners may need all the patience they can muster. Despite the rapidity with which Karma has gotten up to speed  2013 producing vehicles in a factory that was empty less than a year ago  2013 electric vehicles account for less than 3% of all U.S. auto sales, and even industry leader Tesla has still not turned a profit.   201cThe ability of a company like Tesla to generate excitement, and high stock prices, has a lot of other companies convinced there 2019s money to be made in the EV space, 201d said Kelley Blue Book senior analyst Karl Brauer.   201cThat 2019s somewhat ironic because Tesla has never actually made money, and several other EV start-ups, including Karma 2019s predecessor, all went bankrupt. The challenge for the Karma will be convincing people to give it another try after a fairly high-profile failure. 201d  Regulators probe reports of Tesla Model S suspension problems  Elon Musk announces plan to revolutionize factories  After emissions cheating scandal, Volkswagen steers toward electric vehicles Summary: A premium luxury sedan born from the ashes of the Fisker Karma  2013 a Tesla rival that wowed the automotive world before collapsing into bankruptcy three years ago  2013 00a0will soon begin rolling off a production line at California's newest car factory.",

            "input": "text:WASHINGTON, June 27 2014 Justice Thurgood Marshall, a living hero of the civil rights movement and one of the last liberal voices on the Supreme Court, announced his retirement today after 24 years that ended in mounting anger and discouragement as he watched the ascendancy of a conservative-dominated bench.  The 82-year-old Justice, the only black to have served on the Supreme Court, said his resignation would take effect when a successor was confirmed by the Senate. It gives President Bush his second appointment to the Court and will leave it with only one member, Justice Byron R. White, who was named by a Democratic President. Pressure for a Black Nominee  The selection of Justice Marshall's successor will not affect the Court's philosophy as fundamentally as did the appointment of Justice David H. Souter last year, which further tipped the balance away from the old liberal majority and filled the vacancy created by the retirement of the intellectual leader of that coalition, Justice William J. Brennan Jr.  But in making his choice, Mr. Bush will have to balance pressure to cement even further the conservative grip on the Court with equal pressure to appoint a black justice at a time when the President is struggling with Congress over civil rights issues and is anxious to send a message of conciliation to blacks and other critics of his civil rights record.  As was the case with Mr. Bush's appointment of Justice Souter, the question of whether the Supreme Court should overturn the 1973 ruling guaranteeing women the right to abortion is also expected to play a role in the choice of a successor to Justice Marshall. Sense of Isolation  Justice Marshall has always said the Supreme Court was a  lifetime term  from which he would never retire. There has been no dramatic decline evident in his health, despite a fall in a Chicago hotel that hospitalized him last year.  Rather, his resignation was seen as another sign of his growing dissatisfaction and isolation in a court where a solid conservative majority has been eroding some of the principles that Justice Marshall himself helped establish in three decades as a civil rights lawyer. [ Page A13. ]  That sense of frustration was evident today in the Justice's stinging dissent ina death penalty case.  Power, not reason, is the new currency of this Court's decision-making.  Justice Marshall wrote.  When asked what kind of Justice he would like to see replace him, Justice Marshall told The Associated Press,  Me.   Asked what he would do now, Justice Marshall said,  Mind my own business,  adding that the most important challenge now facing the Court was to  get along without me.   Speculation by Congressional and Administration officials about a successor focused today on black and Hispanic judges, most prominently Judge Clarence Thomas of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, a black conservative. Beyond that group, possible candidates included Judges Patrick E. Higginbotham and Edith H. Jones, both of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Texas.  Judge Jones was publicly named as runner-up to Mr. Bush's last nominee, Justice Souter. But Judge Jones may not be able to win Senate confirmation because of her strongly conservative decisions. Warning of 'Bork-Like Fight'  Reaction to Justice Marshall's resignation clearly signaled that the ideological struggle over the Court vacancy would be intense, as it was over President Ronald Reagan's nomination of Judge Robert H. Bork in 1987.  Senator Alan Cranston, Democrat of California, warned that if Mr. Bush  picks another right-wing ideologue like Robert Bork, he can expect another Bork-like fight in the United States Senate that led to the nominee's defeat.   Mr. Cranston added:  If he picks another 'stealth' candidate like David Souter, whose views remained a mystery throughout his hearing, I doubt that he will get the same easy ride through the confirmation process. Given the votes that David Souter has cast in his first term, we now ought to know better.   A senior Administration official said Mr. Bush was most likely to appoint a black or Hispanic judge but could turn to someone from the South, a region not represented on the Court.  It's going to be a big fight, no matter who you do,  the official said.  Souter was a question mark, but this one, if it is a solid conservative or strict constructionist, would really mean a pretty strong conservative majority on the Court.  No Hint of Resignation  Justice Marshall announced the end of a career of nearly six decades in law as a civil rights lawyer, Federal judge, Solicitor General and finally Supreme Court Justice with a terse letter to President Bush that stunned Washington when it was made public about two and a half hours after the Court recessed for the summer.  There had been some speculation that Justice Marshall might retire last week when he sponsored the admission of his son, Thurgood Marshall Jr., to the Supreme Court Bar. But Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist recessed the Court this morning without any hint of Justice Marshall's plans, and the resignation appeared to take even Mr. Bush by surprise. Summary: Justice Thurgood Marshall, a living hero of the civil rights movement and one of the last liberal voices on the Supreme Court, announced his retirement today after 24 years that ended in mounting anger and discouragement as he watched the ascendancy of a conservative-dominated bench.   The 82-year-old Justice, the only black to have served on the Supreme Court, said his resignation would take effect when a successor was confirmed by the Senate. It gives President Bush his second appointment to the Court and will leave it with only one member, Justice Byron R. White, who was named by a Democratic President. Pressure for a Black Nominee     The selection of Justice Marshall's successor will not affect the Court's philosophy as fundamentally as did the appointment of Justice David H. Souter last year, which further tipped the balance away from the old liberal majority and filled the vacancy created by the retirement of the intellectual leader of that coalition, Justice William J. Brennan Jr.",

            "input": "text:John Tiffin, whose award-winning foreign reports over four decades helped build and define the success of  60 Minutes  died at home in Rusper, England, last Thursday (March 4) after a long illness. He was 80.  Working almost exclusively with Morley Safer overseas, Tiffin turned out investigations, features and profiles in the      London office from 1970 until 2002. Out of this long partnership came the off-beat, usually humorous stories that became Safer's signature. Tiffin's keen vision learned as a cameraman - he filmed and produced much of his early work - combined with Safer's gift with words to create the perfect newsmagazine team.  John Tiffin was a remarkably talented man,  said Safer.  He raised the sometimes banal exercise of television news to high art. He had an eye for the perfect shot, that moment that said it all, and yet remained the most modest of men. He was also a perfect friend.   It was Tiffin's eye for the unusual that brought him and Safer together for such memorable  60 Minutes  features as  a whimsical report on the famous and historic Orient Express before it went out of service (1977);  an journey to the mid-ocean Maldives that turned out to be an incredible story (1979);  the home for retired Italian opera singers (1987); and  Tango Finlandia,  a look at the odd obsession with tango dancing in Finland (1993).  Perhaps their most prominent story is often credited by the wine industry with popularizing red wine in the U.S. In 1991, Tiffin and Safer collaborated on the  The French Paradox,  reporting that the French enjoyed a low incidence of heart disease despite a famously rich diet. Regular consumption of red wine was given credit for this contradiction and bottles of red began flying off the shelves of American liquor stores once the report was seen by the millions of  60 Minutes  viewers.  In the moving  The Music of Auschwitz,  Tiffin and Safer profiled Fania Fenelon, a French Jew sent to the infamous camp and forced to perform in a female orchestra that played while prisoners were marched to the gas chambers. The 1978 segment inspired a made-for-television film on the subject, 1980's  Playing for Time,  which starred Vanessa Redgrave.  Tiffin's colorful stories brought foreign crime, culture and conflict into the homes of Americans, solidifying  60 Minutes  reputation for fine, unique foreign reporting. He won one of his three Emmy awards for  The Heroin Labs of Marseilles,  a 1972 story that was part of a series tracing the drug's route from poppy fields to the streets of the U.S. He won another in 1985 for  The Beeb,  which captured a day in the life of the BBC's radio service.  Life and Death in an Irish Town  characterized the sectarian violence in the Northern Irish town of Strabane in 1975, to which Safer and Tiffin returned 20 years later for an update.  Lagos  was a 1983 investigation detailing the corruption in the Nigerian city just before the government was overthrown. He won his last Emmy for  Dusko Tadic  in 1996, a report on a Serbian charged with the torture and murder of Muslims in the Balkan War.  He did several stories on India. In 1985's  Till Death Us Do Part,  he and Safer reported on the horrible practice of  bride burning  in the country - the burning alive of a young bride whose dowry was deemed too small - earning a commendation from the American Women in Radio and Television Awards. They continued their coverage with two more stories on the predicament of women in India in 1992 and 1993 with  Ameena,  a story about a 13-year-old girl sold to an elderly Saudi man and  The Year of the Woman,  which reported how female infants in India are often aborted.  John Alan Gower Tiffin was born in London on February 4, 1930. He was educated at Dulwich College and the Royal College of Art, both in London. He also briefly attended Columbia University in New York between 1959 and 1960 as part of a CBS sabbatical program. While in New York, he met native Philadelphian Wendy Ewer, whom he married and took back to England in 1960.  He joined CBS News in the London Bureau in 1954 as a cameraman and soon found himself filming wars in Cyprus, the Suez and the Belgian Congo. He rose to associate producer and then producer, continuing to shoot the stories he produced. He distinguished himself in 1964 by winning an Overseas Press Club award for best film photography for  Ethiopia: The Lion and the Cross,  broadcast on  The Twentieth Century  documentary series.  It was at this time that his long association with Safer began when the young Canadian correspondent joined CBS News in London. They became a team, reporting for  The  with Walter Cronkite.  Safer and Tiffin covered Europe, the Middle East and Africa for the next six years and continued together when Safer was asked to join  60 Minutes  in 1970.  He was a great journalist and a great gentleman. He and his close friend Morley Safer had a partnership that lasted through more than four decades - and together they produced some of the most memorable pieces ever to air on 60 Minutes,  said the broadcast's Executive Producer Jeff Fager.  He was also a kind and thoughtful friend and colleague to many of us at CBS News and we will miss him.   Tiffin is survived by his wife, Wendy; three children: George, Edward and Martha Tiffin; and three grandchildren. A funeral in England will be held on March 16.  Copyright 2010 CBS.

Lynch was expected to discuss the matter further at a summit Friday in Aspen, Colorado.  This revelation comes amid a controversy surrounding an impromptu private discussion that Lynch had aboard her plane on the tarmac at a Phoenix airport on Monday with Clinton 2019s husband, former President Bill Clinton. That get-together has been criticized as inappropriate by Republicans and some Democrats at a time when the Justice Department has been investigating whether classified information was mishandled through Clinton 2019s exclusive use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.  Lynch told reporters that she did and Bill Clinton did not discuss the email investigation during the encounter.

They will have been rollocked by trainers for going too soon and for leaving their run too late. Put it this way. The Telegraph 2019s racing correspondent, Marcus Armytage, won the Grand National as an amateur on Mr Frisk. To him riding was not a sudden fancy. It was a lifetime 2019s challenge.  Pendleton 2019s problem is that she is going straight in at the top. The Foxhunter Chase will sound to the uninitiated like a lark for gadabout country types squeezed into the show; but it requires a level of experience in race riding that Pendleton cannot hope to have. Experience of delivering a horse at a fence, sensing danger and generally managing the unpredictable creature carrying her up and down dale.  Pendleton wants to switch over from a successful cycling career  The whole problem with her commendable and fascinating switch of sports is that it has mutated into some kind of race against time. Can she be ready for Cheltenham? Can she learn quickly enough from her fall at Fakenham last Friday to justify a berth alongside the best of the trade? Well, how about giving her another year. What, exactly, is the hurry?  She sounds ready to wait, if necessary, but a wave of curiosity is carrying her too fast to a dangerous place.  201cIf it 2019s not meant to be this year, it 2019s not meant to be, 201d she says. Yet she also runs the risk of retreating into a siege position, which would feed her determination but distort her thinking.  201cI always go by the one in five rule, 201d she says.  201cThat is, one in five people will never like you but one in five may love you. 201d   2022 The failed attempts to switch sports  This is the Olympian in her speaking. The gold medallist. The competitor. But  201clikes 201d and  201cloves 201d have nothing to do with it. Only a troll would want her to fail. The aim, surely, is to accord National Hunt racing the proper respect by acknowledging how hard it is and step back from the racing-against-the-clock element of her development.  Already she is a wonderful advert for jump jockeys. She is showing how much practice and perseverance it takes to convert recreational riding into piloting round Cheltenham. Or even Fakenham, where she was bumped out of the saddle, prompting the most graceful of all National Hunt riders, John Francome, to say:  201cShe wants saving from herself. I 2019ve never met her, she seems a lovely girl but she can 2019t ride and she 2019s an accident waiting to happen. She could have fallen off at any fence. It 2019s not just about Cheltenham, she could come off on a Sunday afternoon at a point to point. She wants stopping before she hurts herself. 201d  Leaving aside the  201clovely girl 201d bit, which bears no relevance, Francome was expressing a common view, not as a dismissal of her potential but an assessment of where she is now. Steve Smith Eccles, another legend and now a riding coach, said she was  201ctoo loose in the saddle. 201d  Switching sports is no lifestyle choice, as anyone who saw Freddie Flintoff try to box will testify. Many years ago the job took me to Birmingham, Alabama, to watch Michael Jordan play for a minor league baseball side as part of his preparation for the major leagues. Straight away the senses registered the incongruities. Jordan, the all-time greatest basketball star, looked all wrong in his new vocation. He had wandered into the wrong movie. Soon he was back at the hoops.  There are exceptions: Sonny Bill Williams in rugby union, rugby league and boxing, Rebecca Romero in rowing, cycling and triathlon. But Pendleton is making a grander leap, from a two-wheeled machine to half a ton of horse with huge obstacles to jump. So she is entitled to see this as a long-term mission, not a publicity exercise or a mad dash with excitable sponsors in tow.  The hope is that one day she will sail round Cheltenham; clear every fence and hear the crowd 2019s roar rebound off Cleeve Hill on some sunny spring afternoon. To postpone that dream is only to make it more feasible.  The phrase  201ctransparent voting booths 201d may have caught your eye in this parodic Fifa presidential race. They are being demanded by Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein of Jordan, who is turning into the relative transparency candidate in a contest beset by all the old conniving.  Ali, left, wants to succeed Blatter, right, as Fifa president  Ali has asked the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to rule on his proposal that see-through booths be used for Friday 2019s vote. Why? Because the Prince wants to ensure that delegates refrain from photographing their ballot papers. Why would they do that? To stop delegates coming under pressure from interested parties to prove how they voted.   2022 Everything you need to know on the Fifa election  Fifa argue that it is sufficient for delegates to surrender their mobile phones before ticking a box. Under the governing body 2019s statutes, voting is secret, which offers all sorts of possibilities for the electorate to say one thing to a candidate and do another. Delegates are even calling Sepp Blatter for advice instructions on how to vote.  So while the football-loving masses are out there awaiting the fate of the World Cup, not to mention the soul of the game, we appear to be stuck at the square-one of trust, manipulation and electoral probity. And people actually think Fifa can be saved.

To mark the occasion a major new lift, the Teton high-speed quad chair, was built. Plus a new restaurant, the Piste Mountain Bistro, joined the recently opened Off-Piste Market gourmet grab-and-go eatery in the lower level of the Rendezvous Lodge, at the top of the Bridger Gondola.  Until the mid-80s, few people had heard of what is now the cult ski area of Jackson Hole. Tucked into the top left-hand corner of Wyoming, with a Teton mountain range backdrop, it is now one of North America's foremost resorts. Over the last decade, Jackson Hole has invested heavily in new facilities, lifts and terrain upgrades aimed at intermediates.  Originally named Jackson's Hole after the Virginian trapper David Edward Jackson, the valley in which the resort is found is 60 miles long and 15 miles wide, running from Hoback Junction in the south to Jackson Lake and Togwotee Pass in the north. It 2019s remote and wild, with a rich variety of wildlife (including elk, moose, coyotes, the odd wolf and even bald eagles).  Confusingly, the ski area of Jackson Hole does not share its name with its local resort, Teton Village, or the cowboy town of Jackson, 12 miles to the south east  2013 only the valley, Jackson Hole. When Paul McCollister opened the ski area in 1965, he named it Jackson Hole  2013 now Jackson Hole Mountain Resort  2013 but it's usually referred to by skiers and snowboarders simply as Jackson.  Teton Village is a horseshoe-shaped community of shops, lodgings and resort admin offices planted snugly at the base of the ski area, alongside the resort 2019s iconic Tram (the American name for a cable car)  2013 where you might occasionally see a wandering moose  2013 and the more recently constructed Bridger Gondola. The USA has very few cable cars, and the Tram was installed by resort founder Paul McCollister to help produce a European atmosphere.  It's a charming little resort, rather dwarfed by the huge, slopeside Four Seasons 2019 Hotel. You can get to pretty much everywhere on foot and there 2019s everything you could need for your holiday in the village  2013 and enough restaurants to enable you to try a different one each night.  For the last 10 years the ski area has averaged 11m of snow each winter, though like any other resort, it does inevitably experience the occasional poor snow year. In the 2007 08 season, the resort had an all-time record 15m of snowfall combined with a then record number of visits.  A new electronic gate system was installed last season to get skiers and snowboarders on to the slopes faster and with less hassle. Once guests have purchased a reusable J Card  2013 that operates the lift turnstyles automatically  2013 they can reload it online at any time, eliminating waiting in line.  Other on-mountain improvements include re-routing and widening the South Pass Traverse between the Casper Restaurant and Apres Vous mountain to make it easier and more pleasant to negotiate. A new Crags chairlift was installed in the summer of 2015, and recently the resort spent nearly $6 million on the installation of the Casper high-speed detachable quad  2013 a boost for accessing intermediate terrain.  It's no surprise with the resort's coming of age over the last quarter of a century that some say Jackson Hole is now North America's top resort.

The former prime minister, who now runs the Tony Blair Faith Foundation, switched from the Anglican church to Catholicism soon after leaving Downing Street two years ago. His wife and children were already Catholic.  He told the Communion and Liberation meeting in the Italian resort of Rimini yesterday:  Ever since I began preparations to become a Catholic, I felt I was coming home ... this is now where my heart is, where I know I belong.   Blair said he was  humbled  to make a speech to such eminent delegates because he was a  very new entrant  to the Catholic church.  In off-the-cuff remarks reported by the London Evening Standard, he added:  Frankly, this all began with my wife. I began to go to mass and we went together. We could have gone to the Anglican or Catholic church  2013 guess who won?   As time went on, I had been going to mass for a long time ... it's difficult to find the right words. I felt this was right for me. There was something, not just about the doctrine of the church, but of the universal nature of the Catholic church.   Blair, now also a Middle East quartet envoy, used his speech to tell delegates that it was always a  pleasure  to be in Italy.   It is here in this country that I have spent many happy times, and where, 30 years ago, almost to the day, I proposed to my wife,  he said.  He also spoke of his time as prime minister and, before that, leader of the opposition.   As prime minister of the UK for 10 years, but also as leader of the Labour party for 13, during which time I reformed its constitution precisely around the relationship between the individual and the state, I learned many things,  he said.   I began hoping to please all of the people all of the time, and ended wondering if I was pleasing any of the people any of the time. But that's another story.   Blair reportedly received a standing ovation for his wide-ranging speech, which also included references to past political summits.   I remember when we put climate change and global poverty on the G8 agenda in Gleneagles in 2005, there was considerable disquiet amongst the politicians, worried about the demands made on them,  he said.   But their burden was lightened by the Christian church giving such solid and clear support.   In seeking this path of truth, lit by God's love and paved by God's grace, the church can be the insistent spiritual voice that makes globalisation our servant, not our master.

She said:  201cThey play during the week. They don 2019t need access to the course at the weekend, so why would somebody pay for something they don 2019t want? 201d  Chris Jones, editor of Golf World magazine, said he too had heard women golfers complaining about the Act.  201cA lot of them are on fixed incomes and can 2019t justify an extra  00a340 a month for golf club membership.   201cMost women don 2019t want to play with us men. They don 2019t want to endure the bravado, the trying to play like Tiger Woods, and the swearing, stamping and snapping of golf clubs that ensues. Ladies 2019 day is their day when they can get away from us. 201d  At some clubs, the post of club captain  2013 once the preserve of men only  2013 has been scrapped in favour of separate ladies 2019 and men 2019s captains. A 70-year-old honorary secretary at one club, who asked not to be named, regretted the change.   201cTo be club captain is one of the highest honours. These people that come up with the legislation don 2019t understand the traditions of this place. 201d  Some clubs have introduced changes with reluctance. Lenzie Golf Club, near Glasgow, announced that  201cveteran ladies 201d would now be expected to pay the same as  201cveteran gents 201d.  However, Robert Chalmers, the club captain, added:  201cI hope members will appreciate the changes are to be made as the result of legislation which we must comply with and not of our own initiation. 201d  A newsletter from Northwood Golf Club in Middlesex worried that  201cthe new law bans the candidacy of a captain only being available to men. There 2019ll be a few harrumphs about this at the club bar, I am sure. 201d  The move was voted through with a big majority, but the club is now grappling with the thornier issue of whether it can still allow husband and wife discounts, or whether the average couple will have to pay an extra  00a3200 in fees.  In Northwood 2019s newsletter, Steve Derbyshire, the club 2019s general manager, writes that  201chusband and wife competitions are discriminatory and need to be 'mixed competitions 2019 in future, taking into account civil partnerships as well as gender reassignment and sexual orientation issues 201d.  Alison Root,43, the editor of Women & Golf magazine and a regular player, admitted:  201cTo be honest, a lot of women don 2019t want change. They play during the week. They don 2019t care what happens on Saturdays. If you 2019re happy with your lot, why change? 201d  Objections to the Act among female golfers surprised Barry Johnston, compiler of the book The Wit of Golf.  201cI am sure they don 2019t want to go back to the bad old days, 201d he said.   201cThat 2019s when you heard stories about the ladies sitting on the veranda who were appalled by swearing from so-called gentlemen on the 18th hole. When the ladies complained, the committee took action  2013 by banning ladies from the veranda. 201d Summary: The Equality Act has given women more rights in golf clubs &ndash; but many lady   golfers have been left out of pocket and out of sorts.",

            "input": "text:Indeed, the big question now facing Sea The Stars is how will he take to his new role? A completely different question to those asked of him on the track. Will he prove fertile, capable of serving 100 to 130 mares (each at a predicted fee of around  20ac75,000). There have been high profile failures, George Washington and El Gran Senor being among the most notable, so nothing is guaranteed.  Over the years, the formula for working out a stallion's potential earnings has been modified. Currently, the popular modern sire can expect a book of between 120 and 150 mares per covering season and the most widely-used calculation is based on four active years. Then there is the addition of an annual season in the Southern Hemisphere, where another band of mares will be served.  Over the past two decades, Sadler's Wells proved himself the most successful commercial sire ever. His stud fee was listed as 'private', but was estimated to be in excess of  00a3200,000 in his prime. His sire, Northern Dancer, stood for a staggering $500,000 in his final season.  In today's tough financial climate, his descendants carry on the family name, for both racecourse performance and popularity. The three most successful stallions are Galileo (believed to stand for  20ac150,000), Danehill Dancer and Montjeu (both for between an estimated  20ac80,000 and  20ac100,000).  Sea The Stars is an extremely attractive stallion proposition, yet he is still unproven. He has the looks, the pedigree (Galileo is his half-brother), the temperament, and the racecourse performance.  At present, Sheikh Mohammed and his Darley operation are vying with the Irish National Stud for the privilege of standing Sea The Stars. The Tsui family, the colt's owners, are still in negotiation with those interested. Potential buyers are few, which must limit the price.  It is highly unlikely that Coolmore Stud, one of the world's major bloodstock operations, will become involved in a bidding war. Coolmore broke their association with the Tsui family some while ago and, despite seeing Sea The Stars beat their colts in four major races this year, they are expected to look to Rip Van Winkle.  So, brilliant racehorse though he was. Sea The Stars may not break any more records. Summary: Sea The Stars is extremely fashionable at present, but will he be in three   years? That is the question potential purchasers must ask themselves.",

Adentro hay cuatro relucientes canchas de b 00e1dminton de tama 00f1o oficial, un deporte del que hasta hace poco solo algunos brasile 00f1os hab 00edan o 00eddo hablar, y mucho menos hab 00edan jugado.  Este es el Centro Miratus: en una tarde cualquiera unos 200 ni 00f1os y ni 00f1as del lugar estar 00e1n entrenando all 00ed, vestidos con camisetas id 00e9nticas de color amarillo con verde. Pero para el mejor de todos, Ygor Coelho de Oliveira  2014de 19 a 00f1os 2014, no solo es su cancha, tambi 00e9n es su hogar. O, m 00e1s bien, las canchas y su casa son parte de la misma estructura: su padre Sebasti 00e3o, profesor de educaci 00f3n f 00edsica y carpintero autodidacta, construy 00f3 ambas con sus propias manos. Si uno se asoma por la ventana del segundo piso de la casa y mira hacia abajo, se pueden ver las canchas.   201cQuer 00eda aprovechar la vista y ver todo lo que suced 00eda 201d, dijo Sebasti 00e3o de Oliveira.  201cPara m 00ed es como ver televisi 00f3n 201d.  Su hijo es delgado, alegre y est 00e1 a punto de hacer historia: en los pr 00f3ximos d 00edas,  00e9l y otra jugadora del Centro Miratus, una mujer de 20 a 00f1os llamada Lohaynny Vicente, ser 00e1n los primeros jugadores brasile 00f1os de b 00e1dminton en estar en unos juegos ol 00edmpicos. Actualmente Oliveira es el n 00famero 62 del mundo, mientras Vicente es la n 00famero 72, lo cual es impresionante si se considera lo dif 00edcil que es mejorar las t 00e9cnicas sin competir regularmente con una comunidad de jugadores superiores.  Por otro lado, los grupos de hombres y mujeres que participan en las olimpiadas est 00e1n compuestos, cada uno, por solo 38 atletas. Estos dos brasile 00f1os se han ganado la posibilidad de entrar a la competencia m 00e1s prestigiosa del deporte como cortes 00eda del beneficio poco conocido de ser el anfitri 00f3n de los juegos ol 00edmpicos: se reservan lugares para los atletas del pa 00eds anfitri 00f3n siempre y cuando sean razonablemente competitivos. Tanto De Oliveira como Vicente alcanzan ese nivel, pero decir que pelear 00e1n por una medalla ser 00eda generoso. Esto los convierte en parte de un subgrupo inusual de personas que ahora los medios brasile 00f1os celebran: atletas con historias inspiradoras que definitivamente van a perder.   201cNo queremos humillar a nadie 201d, dijo Jo 00e3o Pedro Paes Leme, director deportivo de Rede Globo, la cadena de televisi 00f3n m 00e1s grande de Brasil.  201cPero al mismo tiempo queremos se 00f1alar a la gente que est 00e1 haciendo el mejor esfuerzo de su vida para estar aqu 00ed. Incluso ellos saben que no ganar 00e1n una medalla. Su medalla es competir en la primera ronda. Y algunas de sus historias son m 00e1s populares entre los televidentes que las de los medallistas de oro 201d.  Enfocarse en personas como de Oliveira es una cuesti 00f3n matem 00e1tica. La delegaci 00f3n ol 00edmpica del pa 00eds es de 450 atletas y el Comit 00e9 Ol 00edmpico de Brasil se ha puesto como meta ganar entre 25 y 30 medallas. Si Globo se enfocara solo en los ganadores, tendr 00eda una cobertura de menos del 10 por ciento de los participantes brasile 00f1os. As 00ed que, adem 00e1s de presentar h 00e9roes ol 00edmpicos y competidores locales, Globo transmite historias que podr 00edan llamarse  201cNarrativas inspiradoras de derrotas inminentes 201d.  Pero detr 00e1s de estas historias tambi 00e9n hay tesoros escondidos. Si nunca hubi 00e9ramos conocido a Ygor de Oliveira, nunca hubi 00e9semos conocido a su padre, quien ha convertido un sue 00f1o muy peculiar en realidad a trav 00e9s de la pura fuerza de voluntad.  CreditDado Galdieri para The New York Times  El hombre detr 00e1s de  201cel proyecto 201d  Sebasti 00e3o Dias de Oliveira tiene 51 a 00f1os y se parece a Danny Glover en sus d 00edas de Arma Mortal, pero sin el bigote. Es el arquitecto, el alba 00f1il y el entrenador de Miratus, por lo que normalmente hay ni 00f1os que lo siguen y  00e9l los dirige a trav 00e9s de una mezcla de gritos, gestos y carisma. Teniendo en cuenta que es el cerebro y el m 00fasculo detr 00e1s de esta aventura quijotesca, de Oliveira da la impresi 00f3n de ser un hombre sorprendentemente razonable, sobre todo cuando describe el comienzo de lo que llama  201cel proyecto 201d.  Sebasti 00e3o se crio en un orfanato de R 00edo y ve 00eda a su madre durante las vacaciones, cuando los dos se dedicaban a buscar material reciclable en el que entonces era el basurero m 00e1s grande del mundo. (Ese vertedero, Gramacho, fue escenario para el documental Waste Land de 2010, y desde entonces ha cerrado). Muchos a 00f1os despu 00e9s, en 1998, un colega del bachillerato donde ense 00f1aba de Oliveira le regal 00f3 una raqueta de b 00e1dminton que compr 00f3 en un viaje a Italia.   201cLe pregunt 00e9:  2018 00bfEs para tenis? Una pelota podr 00eda atravesarla 2019 201d, record 00f3 de Oliveira, sentado en la cafeter 00eda que le agreg 00f3 hace poco al centro.  No se usa una pelota, le explic 00f3 su amigo. Se usa un  201cvolante 201d. Vamos a probarlas.  Sin una red, la pareja vole 00f3 una y otra vez en la playa. De Oliveira estaba embelesado.   201cEl deporte me eligi 00f3 201d, dijo.  201cSupe de inmediato qu 00e9 deb 00eda hacer con el proyecto 201d.  Hasta ese momento el proyecto era una piscina, para la cual estaba excavando al lado de su casa. Como muchas favelas, Chacrinha es una villa que surgi 00f3 de la nada y que est 00e1 fuera del mapa, al mismo tiempo amigable y peligrosa. La piscina iba a ser un centro comunitario y un espacio para ni 00f1os cuyas primeras oportunidades hab 00edan llegado de mano de narcotraficantes que buscaban nuevos reclutas.  De Oliveira dej 00f3 de trabajar en la piscina y comenz 00f3 a hacer una cancha de b 00e1dminton con las herramientas que iba encontrando. Todos, incluida su esposa, pensaron que el concepto era rid 00edculo.  00bfB 00e1dminton?  00bfEn una favela? Solo hab 00eda unas cuantas canchas en el pa 00eds, la mayor 00eda en lugares lujosos, como los clubes campestres.  Pero de Oliveira quer 00eda lograr, sin ninguna ayuda, el  00fanico semillero para talentos de b 00e1dminton en Brasil. Comenz 00f3 con una cancha sencilla de asfalto en el exterior, donde los ni 00f1os jugaban descalzos. Muchos m 00e1s empezaron a llegar y as 00ed comenz 00f3 el trabajo de 17 a 00f1os de construir una instalaci 00f3n bajo techo en constante expansi 00f3n.   201cTodo el dinero que he ganado en la vida est 00e1 en este centro 201d, dijo de Oliveira.  201cLo constru 00ed con mi dinero, mi sudor, mi sangre 201d.  Aunque s 00ed le ayudaron un poco. Despu 00e9s de que empezaron a aparecer algunos art 00edculos sobre su proyecto en los medios brasile 00f1os, un suizo visit 00f3 el centro y despu 00e9s envi 00f3 volantes, ropa y raquetas. Algunas agencias no gubernamentales enviaron materiales de construcci 00f3n. En 2007, de Oliveira record 00f3 sus habilidades de reciclador para recolectar materiales que se descartaron despu 00e9s de los Juegos Panamericanos de R 00edo. Su casa fue un sitio de construcci 00f3n durante a 00f1os.   201cMi familia pas 00f3 por muchas cosas mientras constru 00eda este centro 201d, agreg 00f3.  201cEl piso de la casa parec 00eda la calle 201d.  La recompensa, a trav 00e9s de los t 00edtulos, lleg 00f3 en 2006. Desde entonces, los jugadores de Miratus han ganado 68 medallas en los campeonatos de menores panamericanos, 22 de oro y m 00e1s de 30 t 00edtulos de los Juegos Sudamericanos de la Juventud.   00bfC 00f3mo pudo ense 00f1ar de Oliveira un deporte que conoci 00f3 por primera vez como adulto? Cuando se lo pregunt 00e9 hizo una pausa y despu 00e9s se par 00f3. Levant 00f3 un pie y despu 00e9s lo baj 00f3. Despu 00e9s levant 00f3 el otro y lo baj 00f3. Despu 00e9s lo repiti 00f3, muy despacio.   201c 00bfQu 00e9 estoy haciendo ahora? 201d, pregunt 00f3.   00bfLevantar y bajar los pies?   201cEn realidad 201d, dijo,  201cestoy bailando samba. Eso es el primer nivel. Este es el segundo 201d.  Movi 00f3 los pies un poco m 00e1s r 00e1pido.   201cEste es el nivel tres 201d, dijo. Sus zapatos deportivos eran una mancha borrosa.   201cEn un comienzo consegu 00ed cuerdas, pero a los ni 00f1os no les gustaban, as 00ed que decid 00ed que les ense 00f1ar 00eda a jugar b 00e1dminton por medio de algo que yo conoc 00eda y ellos tambi 00e9n: la samba 201d.  En ese momento baj 00f3 por las escaleras de la cafeter 00eda hacia las canchas. Hab 00eda cerca de 50 ni 00f1os. En silencio se api 00f1aron alrededor de  00e9l y se ubicaron en columnas con la misma distancia a cada lado de las redes, tres columnas por cancha. Hab 00eda un gran altavoz en el piso y pronto comenz 00f3 la m 00fasica: un ritmo lento de samba con una melod 00eda que hab 00eda escrito de Oliveira, el maestro de la autosuficiencia.  Con raquetas en la mano, los ni 00f1os comenzaron a marchar con el ritmo sin moverse de su lugar. El sonido de un silbato era la se 00f1al de cambio. Repet 00edan al un 00edsono un ejercicio diferente y m 00e1s complejo: daban pasos de lado a lado y simulaban remates sobre la cabeza, se estiraban hacia adelante y golpeaban de rev 00e9s, y as 00ed sucesivamente.  La secuencia de 20 minutos culmin 00f3 con los ni 00f1os lanzando los volantes sobre la red a alguien m 00e1s que los atrapar 00eda, esperar 00eda el ritmo indicado y despu 00e9s los lanzar 00eda de regreso. Los  00fanicos sonidos eran los zumbidos de los volantes que hac 00edan arcos id 00e9nticos, y una m 00fasica instrumental lenta y delicada de piano y bater 00eda. Era un espect 00e1culo de precisi 00f3n militar, belleza incomparable y rasgos conmovedores. Algunos ni 00f1os usaban sandalias y todos ven 00edan de un lugar muy lejano de las clases media y alta de Brasil, un pa 00eds en el que crecer en una favela es un antecedente tan permanente como un tatuaje. Sin embargo, ah 00ed estaban: bailando, lanzando y mejorando en un entorno que los impuls 00f3 a aspirar a otra cosa.   201cMi sue 00f1o es que alguien que crezca en una favela y entrene en una favela pueda inspirar a otros chicos de las favelas 201d, agreg 00f3 de Oliveira.  201cQuiero resaltar el  00e9xito en lugar del crimen 201d.  De Oliveira sabe que la mejor oportunidad para alcanzar este sue 00f1o ahora se encuentra en las manos  00e1giles de su hijo, quien tiene una sonrisa ancha y un remate elevado impresionante. La faceta ol 00edmpica de Ygor, junto con su irresistible condici 00f3n de local, lo han convertido en el rostro de Miratus, y Globo lo ha visitado para filmarlo en varias ocasiones.  Aunque es estudiante de la escuela de b 00e1dminton con samba, aprendi 00f3 mucho de la mec 00e1nica del juego  2014lo que se hace arriba de la cintura, como la volea 2014 de videos de superestrellas del deporte que vio en YouTube. Su  00fanico roce constante con competidores fuertes fue en 2014, cuando pas 00f3 tres meses en Dinamarca, una potencia del juego, con dinero que gan 00f3 en un torneo.   201cEmpec 00e9 aqu 00ed 201d, dijo sobre su estancia en Dinamarca, y se 00f1al 00f3 su nivel de habilidad colocando una mano a la altura del hombro. Entonces la mano se dispar 00f3 sobre la cabeza.  201cY termin 00e9 aqu 00ed 201d.  Ygor se enfrentar 00e1 a atletas de pa 00edses como China, donde la cantera de talentos es 100 millones de veces m 00e1s fuerte y el gobierno respalda generosamente el entrenamiento, la vivienda y la alimentaci 00f3n de sus mejores jugadores. Ygor de Oliveira parece estar demasiado enamorado de estas luminarias como para envidiarlas. En un evento de prueba reciente que se hizo en R 00edo conoci 00f3 a Lin Dan, tal vez el mejor jugador de b 00e1dminton en la historia, quien pronto competir 00e1 por su tercera medalla de oro consecutiva en juegos ol 00edmpicos.   201cAlguien le ense 00f1 00f3 a desearme  2018feliz cumplea 00f1os 2019 en portugu 00e9s 201d, dijo de Oliveira con una sonrisa brillante.  201cFue un productor de Globo, en realidad. Y me tom 00e9 una foto con  00e9l 201d.  Hay un competidor de acero debajo de ese exterior embelesado, y de Oliveira ha sorprendido a muchos de sus oponentes mejor clasificados. Nadie parece haberle explicado que tan solo participar en los juegos es un triunfo, y  00e9l tiene claro que quiere llegar a los cuartos de final. Pero si no lo logra en estas olimpiadas, tiene la suficiente juventud y confianza para saber que habr 00e1 otras oportunidades.  Por otro lado, dijo, es un favorito de su pa 00eds, lo cual significa que habr 00e1 muchos fan 00e1ticos en R 00edo que ir 00e1n a apoyarlo. Nunca se sabe. O, como  00e9l lo dice, en palabras que tal vez escuch 00f3 de su padre:  201cTodo es posible 201d. Summary: Ygor Coelho de Oliveira, el primer jugador ol 00edmpico de b 00e1dminton de Brasil, empez 00f3 en una cancha que su padre construy 00f3 con sus propias manos en una favela. Este es el Centro Miratus, donde se desaf 00edan los l 00edmites de lo posible.",

WATCH: Kim Kardashian Denies Wearing Butt Pads, Explains Recent Pics: 'Everyone Has Seen My Naked Butt'  The 35-year-old mother of two took to Instagram on Thursday to do what she does best -- show off that body.   Pre photoshoot fittings,  Kardashian captioned a shot of herself in a very revealing black one-piece.  And while that one-piece is about five sizes smaller than the one we would've chosen, it does show off the reality star's tiny waist.  Kardashian's waist has been the subject of speculation recently, as critics suggested that her unbelievably tiny waist in Fergie's new  M.I.L.F.$.  music video had been photoshopped.  Not one to keep quiet, Kardashian quickly clapped back at her haters with a behind-the-scenes clip from the shoot. The video, posted to her Snapchat on Monday, shows Kanye West watching footage of his wife -- and her itty bitty waist -- on a monitor.  F***YoPhotoshop #CorsetLife,  the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star captioned the snap.  But of course she didn't stop there; Kardashian followed up with an explanation on her blog, detailing how her waist was created for the video.  I'm wearing latex shorts with a corset built into the back that cinches-in my waist to be CRAZY tiny...It's called 'styling,' not 'photoshop,'  she wrote.

The rest, according to local media, are foreign  2014 four Chinese, one Pakistani, two Nigerians, two Senegalese and one Zimbabwean.  The composition of execution lineup suggests an attempt to avoid the intense international attention and outcry that happened when Jakarta executed a total of 14 drug convicts last year  2014all but two of them foreign citizens. Then, there were rallies and social-media campaigns for the Australian Bali Nine ringleaders Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, Filipina migrant worker Mary Jane Veloso and Frenchman Serge Atlaoui, urging President Joko  201cJokowi 201d Widodo to pardon the condemned.  There is unlikely to be the same kind of uproar when the prison authorities in the penal island of Nusakambangan conduct the next round of executions, however.  Seven of the 10 foreigners set to be executed came from countries that implement the death penalty (China, Pakistan and Nigeria). The remaining three foreign citizens came from poor African countries: Zimbabwe, which is moving toward eliminating capital punishment, and Senegal, which abolished death penalty more than a decade ago.  The five Indonesian inmates have been transferred to the Nusakambangan in the past month  2014 three of them last Sunday  2014 raising speculation that executions are imminent.

Chan and Sukumaran were executed in April 2015, along with the mentally ill Brazilian Rodrigo Gularte and five other men. But, the government suspended Veloso 2019s and Atlaoui 2019s executions, pending their separate legal cases. The Filipina and the Frenchman are not among the inmates slated to be executed soon.

The disclosure, announced in a securities filing, marked the second activist move this year on a significant U.S. metals and mining company, after Carl Icahn  2019s investment in Freeport-McMoRan Inc. Investors appeared to view the latest move as an endorsement of Alcoa 2019s plan, sending its shares up 4.4% to $9.07 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.  Representatives of Elliott, a New York hedge fund founded by Paul Singer, have been meeting with senior Alcoa executives, including Chief Executive Klaus Kleinfeld. Elliott 2019s analysis that Alcoa is the most undervalued of U.S. metals and mining companies prompted the investment, according to people with familiar with the matter.  The sector has been battered by the downturn in metals prices, and Elliott studied possible investments in other companies. It concluded that Alcoa was the best target because of its thriving aerospace and automotive businesses, which, the hedge fund believes, have been overshadowed by the commodity bust, these people said.  Alcoa was advised of the share purchase  201cseveral weeks ago, 201d the New York-based company said in a written statement.  Prices for raw aluminum have fallen more than 40% since 2011, and Alcoa 2019s share price has fallen by a similar amount.  That decline, Alcoa and Elliott believe, masks the prosperity of the company 2019s aerospace and auto businesses and was behind the aluminum company 2019s announcement in late September that it would spin off its more profitable and diverse parts-making units. The deal is expected to close in the second half of next year, with Alcoa shareholders owning all shares outstanding of both companies.  The raw-metals business, hurt by falling aluminum prices, will include the company 2019s bauxite-mining, alumina-refining and aluminum-production businesses and will still be called Alcoa to reflect the company 2019s heritage as the world 2019s first industrial producer of aluminum.  The other entity, which for now Alcoa is calling its  201cvalue-add company, 201d will comprise its global rolled products, engineered products and solutions, and transportation-and-construction businesses. The Alcoa entities  201cnow each have the strength and scale to each stand on their own, 201d Mr. Kleinfeld said when the split was detailed.  Mr. Kleinfeld, a former chief executive at Siemens AG , has shut down Alcoa 2019s unprofitable raw-aluminum smelters while expanding its manufactured-parts business, including through deals. Last year, it bought U.K. jet-engine parts maker Firth Rixson Ltd., and this year Pittsburgh-based RTI International Metals Inc., one of the world 2019s biggest makers of fabricated titanium products for the aerospace industry.  Further changes could be in store as Elliott gets more involved. Although the hedge fund 2019s representatives have shied away from issuing orders, they are eager to have a  201cconversation 201d with Alcoa about improving the company 2019s profit margins, according to people familiar with the matter.  Alcoa 2019s spinoff will compete with Precision Castparts Corp. of Portland, Ore. Warren Buffett  2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. bought Precision Castparts in August for $37.2 billion, including debt, in Mr. Buffett 2019s biggest acquisition yet.  In the third quarter, Alcoa posted a profit of $44 million, or two cents a share, down from $149 million, or 12 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 11% to $5.57 billion.  Write to John W. Miller at john.miller@wsj.com Summary: Activist investor Elliott Management has taken a 6.4% stake in aluminum producer Alcoa, saying it believes shares of the company are significantly undervalued.",

The decision was made in a case involving cancer experi 00adments at the Jewish Chronic Disease Hospital in Brooklyn. William A. Hyman, a director of the hospital, had charged that patients were used as  201chuman guinea pigs 201d in the tests without their consent.  The Appellate Division's rul 00ading upset an earlier one by Justice John E. Cone of Su 00adpreme Court. He had given Mr. Hyman access to all the hos 00adpital's records. The Appellate Court said Mr. Hyman could inspect business records but not medical records.  The experiments involved the injection of cancer cells into 22 patients on July 16, 1963.   201cThe patients were not told that the injection was of cancer cells because the doctors did not wish to stir up unnecessary an 00adxieties in the patients, 201d the Ap 00adpelate Division said in a review of the case in its decision.   201cThe experiments showed that the sick and debilitated non 00adcancer patients had the same response to foreign cancer cells as healthy volunteers; that is, there was a prompt rejection of the transplant.   201cThis in turn opened a wide possibility that, if there be such a biological mechanism as a defense against cancer, it may be possible to stimulate it either before cancer strikes or per 00adhaps even later when the can 00adcer has taken hold. 201d  The project was financed by the United States Public Health Service and the American Can 00adcer Society and was undertak 00aden by Dr. Chester M. Southam of the Sloan 2010Kettering Institute for Cancer Research after 10 years of study.  The hospital and the doctors in charge of the experiment de 00adclared that each patient gave oral consent. Mr. Hyman con 00adtended that the patients were either incompetent to give their consent or that they did not understand what they were be 00ading asked to do.  The doctors felt that there was no need to tell the patients that cancer cells were being used, the court explained, be 00adcause  201cit was not a cause of increased risk to the patient. 201d  That view was based on the biological law that human be 00adings would reject cells that were transplanted from another human being unless both per 00adsons were of precisely the same genetic constitution, such as identical twins.  Mr. Hyman argued that as a director of the hospital he would be  201cpersonally responsible, both civilly and criminally, for any wrongdoing on the part of the hospital. 201d But the court said his fear that he could be held responsible did not mean that the privacy of the physician 00adpatient relationship could be broken to give him access to medical records.  The court noted that similar experiments would be undertak 00aden the future only with the written consent of patients.  This article can be viewed in its original form.

Corrective services were forced to drag Mumtaz Qaumi and Mohammed Kalal away from one another as the pair fought in the dock in August.  The incident, video of which was released today, occurred midway through a secret seven-month court case where five members of the notorious Brothers 4 Life gang were on trial.  Today, renowned Sydney gangland figure and Brothers 4 Life Blacktown leader Farhad Qaumi was convicted of the manslaughter of a rival club member in 2013.  Three other high ranking figures were also found guilty of manslaughter.  Qaumi was on trial for the shooting death of Mahmoud Hamzy, who was executed in his south-western Sydney garage.  Hamzy suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died in hospital.  Hamzy's cousin Mohammed, the boss of the rival Bankstown chapter of Brothers 4 Life, was the intended target of the shooting.  Qaumi was found not guilty of the higher charge of murder.  Mahmoud Hamzy is a cousin of one of Australia's most notorious gangland figures and Supermax inmates, Bassam Hamzy.  Qaumi was shot in the shoulder when a luxury yacht he was on was peppered with bullets at Rose Bay in 2014 before his arrest.

The Civil Defense agency later said the tsunami threat had passed but warned on its Facebook page that coastal areas could witness strong tidal currents and sea level fluctuations for hours.  Prime Minister John Key has flown to the area and has spoken of the  utter devastation .  He estimates the clean up will run into hundreds of millions of dollars and clearing blocked roads could take months.  The quake, located near Hanmer Springs in North Canterbury at a depth of 15km, struck minutes after midnight and more than 250 aftershocks have since rattled the country.  One person reportedly died of a heart attack and another man lost his life after he was buried beneath the rubble of a house that collapsed in Kaikoura, one of the worst-affected regions.  A local state of emergency has been declared in Kaikoura and Hurunui and Marlborough District Council says police are working to rescue travellers stranded around Kaikoura.  It says the occupants of at least half a dozen campervans north of the coastal town would be airlifted to the Ward welfare centre. Those stranded to the south would be airlifted further south.  The council says there has been major infrastructure damage in Kaikoura, a popular tourist destination and which has about 1000 visitors.  There is no sewerage and no household water supply, but power is being restored.  Shops are closed and people are not able to buy food, fuel or water.   All residents are strongly urged to conserve water,  the council said.   It may take days to restore the household water supply.   Prime Minister John Key said two people were confirmed fatalities.  Police earlier said a casualty was reported at the heritage-listed Elms Homestead at Kaikoura and another person was believed dead at a house at Mt Lyford, north of Christchurch.  Mr Key said a Defence Force helicopter was heading to Kaikoura after it was cut off by slips and ruptured roads and he would fly there on Monday afternoon to inspect the damage.  An Air Force Orion had surveyed main transport routes between Picton and Christchurch.  Schools and early childhood centres from Wellington to Canterbury would remain closed until they had been assessed.  Four homes in Christchurch abandoned by owners after a tsunami warning had been burgled, police said.  The initial quake was registered as a 6.6 magnitude shake before being upgraded by GeoNet seismologists.  A host of aftershocks above magnitude 5 were recorded with the biggest a 6.3 tremor.  The national crisis management centre had been activated but a national state of emergency had not been declared.  People in Cheviot, near the epicentre of the first quake, reported extensive damage.   Family friends in Cheviot say some houses are gone  a woman named Brodie tweeted.  In Wellington some buildings were damaged and windows were smashed.  Wellington Region emergency controller Bruce Pepperell said a number of buildings were showing signs of  structural stress  and inspections were being carried out on bridges and tunnels around the region.  KiwiRail said it had suspended trains on the main trunk line south of Palmerston North in the North Island and north of Christchurch in the South Island.  Cook Strait ferry sailings have been cancelled and about 20 passengers aboard the Kaiarahi spent about 12 hours longer than planned on the vessel after it was unable to dock at Picton.  State Highways in the South Island have also been closed and many other local roads had also been damaged.  The quake comes almost six years after a destructive 6.3 earthquake that killed 185 people in Canterbury early in 2011.

Bishop Brian Farran on Thursday testified that he thought the church's professional standards process was too  in-house '' and that decisions would be better made by an independent statutory body.   I think really the morality of the church has been compromised,  he told the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse.   There has to be absolute transparency and it needs to move out ... of the church and into a body like that.   Bishop Farran has told the royal commission he felt that a group of influential parishioners were out to get him during the professional standards process that led to the defrocking of influential priest Graeme Lawrence in 2012.  He said bishops, especially in smaller dioceses, faced a real conflict of interest risk under the current process.  Commissioner Justice Peter McClellan said Bishop Farran's suggestion of state government-established bodies could raise issues regarding the separation of powers.  But the bishop doubted the church would be able to create its own national body.   The Anglican Church of Australia has a very poor record of doing things together nationally,  he said.   I don't think it's possible.   The royal commission has heard Bishop Farran initially decided to permanently inhibit rather than defrock Lawrence, who had been accused of child sex abuse.  It heard there were rumours among clergy that Bishop Farran and Lawrence had at some point had a homosexual relationship.  The bishop denied the allegation on Thursday.  The royal commission has heard Bishop Farran knew Lawrence from the St John's Theological College at Morpeth, where it's thought 14 alleged perpetrators trained.  A draft report considered by a meeting of bishops in 2009 called the college's numbers a  significant over-representation  and a  disturbing statistic .  Bishop Farran said he referred the report to the professional standards director but did not take up the invitation to take the issue further.  He described a meeting with an alleged victim of another St John's-trained priest known as CKC, who was sexually abused over four years, as traumatic.  He said he had to leave the room at one point and issued a public apology to the man, known as CKA.   I felt contaminated that I was a bishop and this ... man and his family had been treated in such a terrible way,  Bishop Farran said.   I just felt he'd been so wronged.   The hearings into the Newcastle Anglican Diocese continues.

President-elect Donald Trump is expected to withdraw US support, which will scuttle the 12-country Pacific trade pact, after he's inaugurated on January 20.  Although the US Congress has a window to vote on the deal between now and then, it's still unlikely to get up.  Mr Ciobo was coy about specific talking points with Mr Froman and was unable to gain much clarity over where US trade policy is headed.   The story is still being written,  Mr Ciobo told AAP.   It would be like saying to a Labor trade minister what is a Liberal trade minister going to do.   But he's optimistic on other trade negotiation fronts.

And please drop by the weekly wine tasting hosted by a  201csenior executive sommelier. 201d  Welcome to the world of employee perks, Cambridge-style.  As scores of biotechnology companies vie for talent in Cambridge, a global hub for life sciences business and research, they are offering prospective employees an ever-growing list of fringe benefits. Syros Pharmaceuticals Inc., which moved to Cambridge recently from Watertown, provides unlimited vacations along with limitless snacks, on-site yoga, and a company-sponsored ski trip. At three-year-old startup Jounce Therapeutics Inc., bennies range from pet insurance and tuition reimbursement to a fridge stocked with food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. For dessert, the freezer has every flavor of Ben & Jerry 2019s ice cream. Oh, and there 2019s fresh fruit, too.   201cIt 2019s a very, very competitive job market, 201d says Leslie Kaufman, senior director for human resources at Syros.  201cThese perks used to be the thing that differentiated companies, but they 2019re not that unusual anymore. It 2019s something that everyone does. 201d  Voyager Therapeutics Inc. hosts a Stimulate Your Neurons happy hour on Wednesday afternoons, complete with wine tastings and lectures by Bob Pietrusko, a senior vice president of regulatory affairs who doubles as the company 2019s sommelier. The events typically draw more than half of the company 2019s 74 employees, says Kathleen Hayes, Voyager 2019s human resources vice president.  201cPeople who probably couldn 2019t tell red from white are now asking,  2018Is there a Barolo this week? 2019 When we went public, we had congratulatory bottles. Some of these wines are quite expensive. One week we had a $250 bottle. 201d  Read the full list of winners and more stories about worker happiness.  The largesse is part of an employee-nurturing culture that migrated to Cambridge from California in the 1990s. That 2019s when alums of San Francisco Bay Area biotechs like Genentech came east to lead pioneering local companies such as Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc., according to Kaufman. She says she learned at Millennium that mingling at happy hours and other company gatherings  201cabsolutely helps build the foundation for good relationships. 201d  Ultimately, says Kaufman, employees are still drawn by compelling science and the chance to make a difference for patients  2014 but the perks don 2019t hurt. At Mersana Therapeutics Inc. in Cambridge, every day is bring-your-dog-to-work day. Such is the directive from chief business officer Eva M. Jack, who is a volunteer puppy raiser for the nonprofit Canine Companions for Independence.  201cWe have one person who brings her dog in every day, 201d Jack says.  201cI bring my dog in four days a week. You can walk into a meeting and you could have two or three dogs in the meeting. 201d The company recently hired a new head of regulatory affairs who is allergic to dogs. He 2019s been fine so far, though, and  201cif he 2019s in a meeting with a dog, they sit at opposite sides of the room, 201d Jack says.  Robert Kotin and Valerie Rateau share a laugh at a company wine tasting.  Startups aren 2019t the only ones that are perk happy. Takeda Pharmaceuticals Co., the Japanese Big Pharma company that bought Millennium, provides fitness reimbursement, paid days for volunteering, and up to $10,000 in assistance for adoptions. Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research offers flextime, rejuvenation periods, and mini-sabbaticals where employees can spend three weeks to three months at another Novartis site or academic lab to connect with new ideas and expertise. Outings at Cambridge 2019s Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc. range from child-focused  201cfamily fun days 201d to employee socials with Bollywood or Oktoberfest themes.  Can all the perks discourage people from doing actual work? Unlimited vacation time sounds suspect, for sure. But Kaufman says employees seldom abuse the policy, and many take less than four weeks. The goal, she says, is to let employees and their colleagues figure out how and when to complete their tasks without heavy management involvement.  201cIt 2019s treating people like adults, 201d she says.  201cEverybody knows what they have to get done, and we 2019ll assess their performance on whether they do that. 201d Summary: From wine tastings to pet insurance, Cambridge biotechs roll out perks in competition for talent.",

Operation Stopper is set to run across the state from Friday night until Sunday, involving thousands of officers across the state.  Assistant Commissioner Mike Keating says they're focusing on drink-driving in the lead-up to Christmas because of the number of parties at this time of year.   I think the evidence is pretty clear, it's overwhelming, there are social events for families, for friends, for work groups, for associations at this time of year,  Mr Keating said.  While police will be targeting drivers with RBTs this weekend, he said all road users, including pedestrians, need to take care.   We've had 34 pedestrian-related fatalities this year and we know a number of those fatalities have involved people who have been intoxicated through either alcohol or drugs.   I spoke to a member of the community, (to have him) tell me that he saw a man move out of a taxi yesterday afternoon and lay on the roadway.   After projecting a relatively low road toll for 2016 earlier in the year, there have been 17 fatalities on the state's roads in December alone - more than one a day.   These are not made-up stories, these are lives lost and unfortunately, we will see people who are a memory this Christmas, not present for the event.  Summary: Police have launched the annual Operation Stopper in the lead-up to Christmas, focusing on drink and drug driving across the state this weekend.",

WASHINGTON -- U.S. housing starts and permits rose in September, a signal the market's modest recovery is supporting what appears to be growing strength in the broader economy.  Groundbreaking rose 6.3 percent to an annual 1.02 million unit pace, the Commerce Department said Friday.  Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a slightly smaller gain.  Housing is clawing back after it imploded during the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession. It suffered a setback last year when interest rates spiked, but rates have been falling lately.  last week to its lowest level since June 2013, and the level of housing starts is not far from a seven-year high.   If you look at the trend, you are still seeing an upward trajectory,  said Michelle Meyers, an economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York.  U.S. stock futures jumped following a batch of solid corporate earnings reports and on hopes the Federal Reserve might slow the winding down of its stimulus in light of recent weakness in the global economy. Yields on U.S. government debt, however, extended gains after the release of the housing data.  New housing starts for single-family homes, the largest part of the market, rose 1.1 percent in September, while the more volatile multifamily homes segment jumped 16.7 percent.  Permits advanced 1.5 percent to a 1.02 million unit pace last month.  Does Your Home Live Up to the American Average?  Housing Market Recovery Rolls On as Groundbreaking Rises  In 2013, the median lot size of a new sold single-family house was 8,596 square feet, or just under 0.2 acres. While that might not seem like a lot for you suburban homeowners, a regional breakdown shows that the small average size isn't due to urban inhabitants alone. The Northeast enjoys the largest average lot, at 13,052 square feet, while the less densely populated South and West lay claim to just 8,649 square feet and 6,796 square feet, respectively.  From a footprint of 1,650 square feet in 1978, the average American home has grown 50 percent, to 2,478 square feet. Yet tough times seem to be squeezing our expansionary attitude. Although new single-family homes sold in 2013 clocked in at a median 2,478 square feet, single-family homes completed in 2013 amounted to just 2,384 square feet. Homebuilder confidence has  in the last few months, hinting that the housing market's road to recovery might be rougher than expected.  While birth rates have held relatively steady for the past 40 years, everyone apparently needs more elbow room. The share of homes with four or more bedrooms has jumped from 27 percent in 1978 to 51 percent in 2013. And where would a bedroom be without a bathroom? While just 8 percent of 1978 homes had three or more baths, 37 percent of homes now fall in that category.  From 2008 to 2013, both the share of homes with four or more bedrooms and the share of homes with three or more bathrooms have jumped 10 percentage points, while median square footage is up 10.9 percent for the same period.  If there's one strong sign of new housing demand, it's home prices. After nose-diving during the Great Recession to a median sales price of just $216,700, home prices have been roaring back up. In 2013, the median sales price for a new single-family home was $268,900. But for those on the housing hunt, don't be discouraged. Home prices today still don't hold a candle to costs in 2006, according to the well-regarded Case-Shiller Home Price Index. In 2006, the index topped 200 before plummeting to less than 140, and current rates put the index just above 170.  It is America, after all. Our industrialized nation was built on the back of Henry Ford, and America is in no danger of breaking its automobile addiction. In 2013, a whopping 300,000 of the 429,000 new single-family homes sold included a two-car garage. And 98,000 new homes included a three-car garage -- the highest amount since 2007. Of all new homes built, only 10,000 failed to include a garage or carport.  American homebuyers are building bigger homes than ever before. But if there's one thing the recent recession has shown us, bigger isn't always better. Although 30 percent of Americans  , homeownership isn't for everyone. There are plenty of reasons to spend less or invest elsewhere -- and leave keeping up with the Joneses to Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Summary: Housing starts and permits rose in September, a signal the market's modest recovery is supporting what appears to be growing strength in the larger economy.",

Written and directed by Kevin Williamson. Running time: 93 mins. Rated PG-13: A few curse words and a teacher in peril. At area theaters. 2 Stars  Helen Mirren can act with her hands tied behind her back. Or tied to the bedpost, as they are throughout most of  Teaching Mrs. Tingle,  a sour comedy about teens who take revenge on a crusty high-school teacher.  The wonderful Mirren, star of the PBS series  Prime Suspect,  plays the crisp, sarcastic Mrs. Tingle, a history teacher who takes perverse delight in humiliating her students. We've all had such a teacher at one time or another, but thanks to the classically trained Mirren's finesse, Mrs. Tingle is not such an ogre that you care to see her life in danger at the hands of some surpassingly silly teens who don't like their grades.  With whom should we sympathize? Everyone acts very badly in  Mrs. Tingle,  the first script ever penned by Kevin  Scream  Williamson. He has dusted it off to make his directorial debut, but the screenplay shows its greenness by veering awkwardly between black comedy and low-grade horror. For every interesting plot turn, there are several crashing clichs and an inordinate number of cute-dog reaction shots, one of the laziest ways of coaxing an audience into your corner.  Mirren spends most of the movie tied to a bed with a gag in her mouth, and still you can see how good she is in comparison to the young actors who surround her. You can almost read the movie as a metaphor for how the best actors are hog-tied by the crummy roles they're offered.  Fetching  Dawson's Creek  star Katie Holmes plays Leigh Ann Watson, one of a trio of students caught cheating. Leigh Ann is innocent, more or less the stolen copy of an upcoming test was foisted on her just as Mrs. Tingle walked in but this will kill her chances of winning a scholarship that will rocket her out of this small town.  Also in the soup are Leigh Ann's best friend (Marisa Coughlan) and the cute boy (Barry Watson) who threatens to come between them. The three temporarily solve their problem by keeping Mrs. Tingle hostage, but every time the gag comes off, the deliciously skeptical schoolmarm manages to pit the teens against one another, using only psychology and a few well-chosen looks.  Williamson obviously imagined this as a chess game that taps into the teen Zeitgeist. But  Mrs. Tingle  is very much a freshman effort, lacking focus, edge and much of anything to do for a talented supporting cast that includes Jeffrey Tambor, Lesley Ann Warren, Vivica Fox and Michael McKean.

The largest crowd was 103,985 at Super Bowl XIV at the Rose Bowl.  4 The Miami Hurricanes have six former players in the Super Bowl, and Jessie Armstead and Mike Barrow have proudly mentioned it - even bragged about it - every time they have gotten a chance.  People want to talk about Linebacker U and Quarterback U, but Miami is NFL U,  Barrow said.  5 Each player on the winning team gets $58,000. Each losing player: $34,500.  6 This is the third Super Bowl in Tampa, and the first at Raymond James Stadium. Only New Orleans (eight), Miami (eight) and Los Angeles (seven) have had more. Next year's Super Bowl will give New Orleans nine.  7 Tampa's nickname is  the Big Guava.  According to VisitTampaBay.com, the name comes from Gavino Gutierrez, an early Tampa pioneer, who tried to cultivate guavas commercially but was unsuccessful because of the climate and rising land prices. A local newspaper columnist then said that if New York is  The Big Apple,  it would only be right to refer to Tampa as  The Big Guava.   8 Gerry Austin will referee his third Super Bowl, heading a crew that has only one other official with championship game experience. Austin was also the referee in the 1990 and 1997 Super Bowls.  9 The Ravens and Giants enter Super Bowl XXXV riding a combined 17-game winning streak. Baltimore has won 10 straight and the Giants seven straight. That is the second-highest total behind the 18 combined victories by the Dolphins and Redskins entering Super Bowl VII.  10 Neither the Giants nor the Ravens made the playoffs last season. When was the last time that happened? Well, last year, when the Rams and Titans played.  11 Discount broker Charles Schwab is looking smart with Jason Sehorn and Shannon Sharpe playing in the Super Bowl.  Last year, Shannon had a broken collarbone and I had a broken leg. Suddenly those Schwab people are sitting high,  said Sehorn.  12 In a recent nationwide survey of 500 adult men, eBay asked which they would prefer: an all-expense paid trip to the Super Bowl or a date with a supermodel. Seventy-two percent of the men said they would rather go to the Super Bowl.  13 Ravens owner Art Modell is going for his second NFL title. His 1964 Cleveland Browns also were champs.  14 Giants backup QB Jason Garrett has three Super Bowl rings from his time with the Dallas Cowboys.  15 Ravens kicker and former Giant Matt Stover was the entire Baltimore offense during the five weeks the Ravens went without a touchdown. The Ravens were 2-3 in that stretch.  16 CBS is charging advertisers $2.3 million for 30-second spots.  17 About 30,000 hotel rooms are needed for Super Bowl visitors. Jacksonville, which will host the 2005 game, plans to create about 11,000 temporary hotel rooms by docking cruise ships.  18 The Budweiser.com Airship, a 165-foot blimp, will be airborne nearly 12 hours today. It will fly 1,000 feet above the stadium and provide aerial footage.  19 Bern's Steak House in Tampa houses the largest wine collection in the world, according to the Tampa Convention & Visitors Bureau.  20 The Super Bowl got its name from a little rubber ball - a Super Ball that Kansas City Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt saw his children playing with. Inspired, he suggested a new name for the championship game - the Super Bowl.  21 Levi Strauss makes its Super Bowl commercial debut with an ad for  Reissued  569 jeans. A would-be cowboy falls off a kid's coin-operated mechanical pony. Medics find him unconscious. Then they find his Jeans Donor Card. They strip him of his Levis, which they rush to a recipient. The victim later awakes, bewildered to find he's in his skivvies.  22 Trent Dilfer will be the fourth ex-Buccaneer to quarterback a Super Bowl team. The others: Doug Williams, Steve Young and Chris Chandler. The Bucs have never been to the Super Bowl.  23 Giants linebacker Jack Golden turns 24 today.  24 The strong defenses in this year's game could result in the lowest score in Super Bowl history. The current record for fewest points: 21 in 1973 (Miami 14, Washington 7).  25 The Ravens are the third AFC wild-card team in four years to reach the Super Bowl.  26 Ravens quarterback Trent Dilfer has only 23 completions in Baltimore's three playoff wins. That's the same number Giants quarterback Kerry Collins had in the first half of the NFC Championship Game against Minnesota.  27 Tight end Howard Cross is the only Giant left from the Super Bowl XXV win against Buffalo.  28 Bill Parcells will participate in the coin toss, along with Ottis Anderson, the Super Bowl XXV MVP.  29 Although this will be the first Giants-Ravens Super Bowl, it will be the third title game pitting Baltimore and New York. The first was the 1958 NFL Championship between the Colts and the Giants and the second was Super Bowl III between the Colts and Jets.  30 The NFL tags each of the 120 game balls with a strand of synthetic DNA to try to deter counterfeiters. The FBI estimates as much as 80% of sports memorabilia is fake.  31 The Giants allowed only two runs longer than 20 yards this season, fewest in the NFL.

            "input": "text:Indeed. There were 23,000 runners of all shapes and sizes who passed over the start line of the 10-mile race.  On the minibus from our hotel to the start Ben Fogle, the Bupa Team Telegraph captain, got his excuses in early.  I've been a bit under the weather this week, 201d he explained.  I'm not sure how I'm going to get on today. 201d  None of us really knew what we were letting ourselves in for. My collegues Andrew Pettie and Lloyd Hook are both sporty types but neither had run a long-distance race before. As we drove past a caterpillar of runners wearing hi-tech shorts and wind-proof jackets, I cursed my decision to wear leggings.  Within seconds of starting the race, my superficial concerns about kit were quashed when a man in a skin-tight alien suit dodged through the crowd followed by someone in a wedding dress. As it turned out, wearing an underwired bra was the real faux pas. Don't ask!  We ran past the naval warships and were high-fived by children as we trooped through the suburbs. The miles didn't exactly fly by but by mile nine, thanks to jelly babies from the Bupa Boost Zone, I still had some energy for a half-hearted sprint finish beside the Solent.  My time, one hour 27 minutes, seemed respectable enough until I met up with Lloyd (one hour 18 minutes), Andrew (one hour 16 minutes), and Ben, who despite the man flu, had managed one hour 13 minutes, a personal best. This was nothing, though, compared with the winner, Joseph Ebuya of Kenya, who finished in just over 45 minutes, a record for the event.  Despite the aching legs this week, I've enjoyed the challenge of training for a race. But with the clocks going back and winter stretching out in front of us, how do I maintain my fitness?  Ben says that unless he has a race or expedition to aim for he can't motivate himself to exercise.  I have to have a goal if I want to keep fit as I'm naturally very lazy, 201d he says. The day after the race he left for Antarctica for a month and he already has the London Marathon in his sights for next year.  For those of us with desk jobs, it's going to be difficult to force ourselves to run in the dark, cold mornings or evenings.  Phuong Luong, senior physiotherapist at the Bupa Centre in Reading, suggests joining a local running club  2014 it is easier to stay motivated and focused if you're running with others.  As an incentive to train in winter, she's signed up for the Reading Half Marathon in March. There's also Parkrun, which arranges free, weekly, 5km timed runs in parks across the country at weekends (www.parkrun.com), and British Military Fitness (www.britmilfit.com), which organises circuit training and boot camps.  Luong recommends wearing a rain jacket, gloves and full-length tights on winter runs.  You should start a run feeling warm and then take off layers as you get hot, 201d Luong says.  For the next week or so though, Team Telegraph is on a well-deserved break.  You've got to give your body time to recover, 201d Luong says.  You need to eat plenty of protein and a balanced diet. 201d  But after that I'll be on muffin-top alert again.  There's a danger of putting on weight after a race as your body still craves the calories it was having while you were training, 201d Luong says.  The only thing to do will be to put my trainers back on and start running.  Advice on staying motivated in winter  - Find a running buddy. It helps to have someone about the same level of ability as you to run with.  - Join a running club. This is the perfect way to find like-minded people with similar goals.  - Mix it up. Keep your training interesting by varying your runs. Try different distances and new routes, and experiment with faster runs. You could also try the quaintly-named  fartlek 201d training, where you alternate fast and slower paces throughout a run by selecting landmarks to run at maximum speed to (at effort level nine or 10), then jog to recover, before repeating.  - Buy winter running clothes. Start your run feeling warm and remove layers as you go.  - Don't exercise vigorously if you have a cold. Remember that if you over-exercise you suppress your immune system.  - Set yourself achievable goals. Make them SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Time-based.  - Take Bupa's free online running check www.bupa.co.uk readytoruncheck  - For free training programmes and health advice see www.bupa.co.uk running Summary: Team Telegraph's Anna Tyzack enjoyed the challenge of the Bupa Great South    Run, and now wants to maintain her fitness over the winter.",

The wife of ex-Beatle Paul McCartney died at 5:04 a.m. at the age of 56 as her husband and children sat by her bedside in Santa Barbara, Calif., where they had been vacationing.   The blessing was that the end came quickly, and she didn't suffer,  a statement from Paul McCartney's office said.  The grief-stricken singer and his children were in seclusion yesterday. They requested privacy from fans and the media.  Long-time family friend Carla Lane said the McCartneys were consoling each other.  They are doing just what I expected them to do. There's this great unity, this great togetherness.   Paul ended up consoling me. You could say he's being very spiritual about it,  the British screenwriter told Sky News.  I said to him, 'I don't know what to do with myself, Paul. I can't leave it. And he said, 'Well, ask her [Linda], she'll tell you what to do.'    Since being diagnosed in late 1995 with breast cancer, Linda McCartney had endured painful surgery and chemotherapy treatments.  An ardent vegetarian, she appeared to be getting well. But in March it was found that the cancer had spread to her liver.  Two days before her death, Linda and Paul, who had been married for 29 years, went horseback riding, which was one of her main passions.  The sad news, announced by the BBC at 8 p.m. yesterday, sent shock waves throughout Great Britain and the world.  British Prime Minister Tony Blair said,  Linda showed extraordinary courage throughout her illness. She made a tremendous contribution across a whole range of British life.   Paul McCartney's publicist Geoff Baker said the coming days will be hard for the singer and his family.   People may not realize that with the exception of one occasion, Paul and Linda never spent a night apart in the 30 years that they have loved each other,  Baker said.  Santa Barbara Sheriff's Department officials said neither they nor the county coroner were contacted. They assumed McCartney's remains were immediately returned to England on a private jet.  Paul McCartney,55, asked people to remember his wife by donating to charities supporting cancer research, animal welfare,  or best of all the tribute that Linda herself would like best: Go veggie.   Linda Eastman of Scarsdale, married Paul McCartney in London in 1969.  After the breakup of the Beatles, Linda joined her husband's new band, Wings, in 1972 as a keyboard player and backup singer.  Lane said that after Linda was diagnosed with cancer,  She never complained.   While fighting the disease, McCartney mustered the energy to sing  Heaven on a Sunday  with her husband on his 1997 hit album  Flaming Pie.    Any love song I write is written for Linda,  Paul McCartney once said.  In recent years, she was rarely seen in public and missed the 1996 ceremony in which Queen Elizabeth II knighted Paul.  Linda McCartney was last seen in public in March, when she and Paul attended the Paris Fashion Show, where their daughter Stella showed her latest designs for Chloe.  McCartney is survived by her husband and four children, Mary, Stella, James; and Heather from a previous marriage. Funeral arrangements were pending.  Her death was the latest in a string of tragedies to strike the Fab Four, including the 1980 murder of John Lennon and the death from leukemia in 1995 of Ringo Starr's first wife, Maureen Cox Starkey Tigrett.

Treasurys and other safe assets surged.  The Dow Jones industrial average finished down nearly 300 points. It swung in 100 point bursts throughout the day as investors reacted to sometimes conflicting headlines about the next steps in Greece 2019s long-running debt crisis.  The Dow plunged 297 points, or 2.5 percent, to close at 11,658 Tuesday. The S&P 500 fell 35, or 2.8 percent, to 1,218. The Nasdaq dropped 77, or 2.9 percent, to 2,607.  Five stocks fell for every one that rose on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume was heavy at 5.6 billion shares.  Intense selling roiled markets in Europe. Italy 2019s main stock index dropped 6.8 percent. France 2019s fell 5.4 percent and Germany 2019s fell 5 percent.  The value of the dollar rose, and bond prices jumped so dramatically that analysts said they were stunned. Analysts said the bond action reflected fears that the turmoil in Greece would tear at the fabric of Europe 2019s financial system.   2018 2018The Greek referendum puts the connections between European countries at risk, from free-trade agreements to the common currency, 2019 2019 said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.  The prime minister of Greece said unexpectedly Monday that he would put the European rescue plan to a binding vote, the first referendum to be held in Greece since 1974.  The plan requires banks that hold Greek national bonds to accept 50 percent losses to help keep the Greek economy afloat. It also beefs up a European bailout fund and requires banks to strengthen their financial cushions.  International creditors have demanded that Greece enact painful tax increases and drastic cuts in public welfare programs, and Greeks have shown their hostility to those measures in violent protests and strikes.  If the European rescue falls through and Greece defaults on its debt, the ripple effect would be global. Europe could fall into recession, hurting a major market for American exports, and banks could severely restrict lending.   2018 2018The market is being held hostage by a random event that is overshadowing everything else, 2019 2019 said John Canally, an economist at LPL Financial. Canally noted that US manufacturing continued to expand in October and that builders spent more on projects for the second straight month.  In the United States, the market sank Monday before the surprise Greek announcement. MF Global Holdings, a securities firm led by former New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine, was driven into bankruptcy in part because it held European debt.  The selling accelerated after the Greek announcement, and the US market opened today with a drop of almost 300 points.  Some of the selling in stocks came because investors were eager to lock in profits after an almost uninterrupted rally in October. The Dow had its best month in nine years, and the Standard & Poor 2019s 500 index its best in 20 years.

Ford, which before its profits fell off a cliff was promising to increase the fuel economy of its S.U.V.'s by 25 percent, still cares about the environment, company executives insist. Now it has found a way to paint cars that drastically cuts emissions of pollutants, and has patented technology that lets cars run on fuel from corn.  These industrial Goliaths want to be Jolly Green Giants. They have investors to impress and public images to maintain so that they can pursue high-profile projects that need government approvals.

At first, he said, companies simply dealt with regulations; later, they anticipated regulations.   Now I think that a lot of this is evidence that companies are viewing environmental capabilities as a strategic criterion by itself,  he said.  In other words, add environmental impact as an element of consumer choice.  Norms change,  Mr. Rosenfield said.  Andrew L. Shapiro, chief executive of GreenOrder, a New York consulting firm that helped G. E. develop its Ecomagination campaign to stress its environmental credentials, called the current stress on green the  third wave  of business interaction with the environment.  The first, he said, was the familiar conflict with governments and environmentalists over pollution. The second was business concern about the environment and about public image, but with an underlying attitude that environmental good behavior incurs a financial cost. The third, now taking hold, he said, is  seeing environmental leadership or stewardship as a source of business value for firms, in the long term.   Some specialists are not sure how far that trend goes. Mark C. Trexler, for instance, who founded a company in 1991 to advise corporations on carbon mitigation strategies, cited the Super Bowl, the soccer championship and the rock band tour in an article in the current issue of Environmental Forum, a publication of the Environmental Law Institute.   I would venture to say 98 percent of the people attending those events don't have a clue,  he said.  So what are we doing it for?  To educate the people attending, he answered, but consumers have yet to demonstrate much willingness to pay for being carbon-neutral.  Ford is testing that proposition, now offering to sell car buyers  carbon-offsets,  essentially certifications that somebody somewhere is going to build a windmill, make electricity from cow manure or do something else to cut carbon emissions to balance what the new vehicle will emit.  Business, in a step beyond the consumer mainstream, is proceeding with the conviction that there is profit in greenness. And even though the Bush administration, rejecting the Kyoto climate treaty and all mention of a carbon tax, is trying to shield businesses from carbon limits, some are calling for such a system.  Cinergy, a utility with nine large coal-fired power plants, has called for regulations on carbon dioxide emissions. One reason is a simple desire for regulatory certainty. American Electric Power, the country's largest investor-owned coal burner, decided in 2004 to look into the threat posed by global warming. Summary: Most of the green technologies that make money now are profitable only because of government tax incentives or subsidies. Send in the lobbyists!",

            "input": "text:By Robert Zepeda and Erica Butler  Starving herself then bingeing on Cool Whip and Graham crackers; shifting her weight to trick the scale; even disguising herself and going through McDonald's Drive-Thru - these are the kinds of self-sabotage behaviors  Ruby,  the hit weight-loss reality show that ran from 2008 to 2011, was supposed to be an antidote to.  But that's what Ruby Gettinger, the show's star, did, she said in an interview with  20 20.   Watch the full story on  20 20? TONIGHT at 10 ET  For four seasons,  Ruby,  which aired on the Style Network, followed Gettinger's every move as she struggled to go from more than 700 pounds to 250. Her bubbly personality won hundreds of thousands of fans, who cheered her on through achievements like driving, riding a bike and swimming.  Dr. Oz, Regis and Kelly and even Oprah came calling, making Ruby the face of obesity.  With the show came counselors, a nutrition plan, trainers - all working toward the goal: 250 pounds.  But secretly, Gettinger now says, off camera her goal was dramatically different.   I never, ever say this, but in my head, my goal was 128,  Gettinger told ABC News' Amy Robach.  I wanted to be so thin that someone would look at me and say, 'Are you anorexic?'   She didn't quite get to 128, but after season one, she was at 373, almost 130 pounds less than where she began. In the second season, while having some personal setbacks, she still managed to pull out a new low, 357. At the start of season three, Ruby was arguably one of the most documented stories of obesity and weight loss in America.  While the show brought on a celebrity high, the pressure to keep losing was bringing her down, causing stress and meltdowns.   I didn't realize this is such an addiction,  Gettinger said.  Like alcoholism, drugs, you know?   Tennie McCarty, who was a counselor on  Ruby,  runs Shades of Hope, a treatment center for those with eating disorders. She said food addiction is not only real - it can be even worse than alcohol and drugs.   [With] alcoholism, drug addiction, nicotine addiction  2026 [y]ou could live the rest of your life and not drink alcohol, take drugs or smoke nicotine,  she said, whereas food is everywhere, and you have to eat.  Ruby was spiraling out of control - and going off her program for healthy weight loss.   There was a lot of pressure,  she said.  It made me start starving myself to death. I literally did not eat for four days because I knew I had to weigh.  2026 And then after I weighed, I would binge eat.   One day, Gettinger's niece came over, and she had some Chicken McNuggets.   For a week after that,  Gettinger said,  I would go through the Drive-Thru - and I'm not kidding you - put a hat on, glasses, so no one would recognize me.  2026 But just in case they'd recognize me, I would have the phone like this and go, Okay, now, what is it that you wanted?  2026 It was two McNuggets? Okay.  2026 That's just horrible to admit. But it was almost like just that one bit triggers something in me.   Gettinger stopped using her exercise equipment, and covered up her secret.   When I was in a bad place I didn't use them at all. I'd get a washcloth and dust them off. I didn't want people to think, 'She's not using her equipment.'   But the numbers on the scale couldn't lie, so Gettinger devised a way to deceive the scale, the show and the fans rooting for her.   I could figure out a way to lean to this way or that way,  Gettinger said.  I could make a 28-to-30-pound difference.   She even believed her own lie, Gettinger said.   [I was] almost getting excited later on in the day, because people are bragging about the number that I have convinced myself that is the number, too,  she said.  The show's producers weren't fooled and sent Gettinger to a weight-loss camp to restore her motivation. Nothing worked, and  Ruby  was cancelled, leaving fans wondering what happened.   [The producers] said, 'We love you  2026 we're just not going to continue the show,  Gettinger said.  No one said this, but my personal belief is [they cancelled it] because I gained weight,  she added. She said she blamed herself for the show's end and for  letting so many people down.   Soon after the show ended, Gettinger's brother died. She lay in bed, depressed and eating, she said. She gained 50 pounds, taking her back almost to 400.   I woke up with, like, This is it, I'm doing this. It's not about the show; it's not about anything else. I got to finish this for me.   Desperate and with no money, Gettinger turned to her former trainers from the TV show.   I said, Of course, I'm here for you no matter what,  said Shazia Edmonds.  That phone call to me was so refreshing. It felt like she gets it, she wants to do it on her own.   Gettinger has named her new campaign Ruby's Challenge, and has a website to encourage fans to watch her progress and join themselves. She is back in the gym regularly and eating right, and has worked her weight down to 360.  Gettinger said she had learned some hard yet valuable lessons.   The hard road is the best road, and just in the past two months I have never worked out [so] hard, been so strict, been so consistent.   Watch the full story on  20 20?

The prize is awarded to artists with New England ties. In Genger 2019s case, that 2019s her exhibition history in Massachusetts and her study at Brown University, where she earned her undergraduate degree.  A committee made up of deCordova curators selected Genger from a group of nominated artists.  Orly Genger and Larissa Goldston Gallery   201cI like the sheer ambition of her work, 2019 2019 said Nick Capasso, the deCordova 2019s deputy director for curatorial affairs.  201cThere 2019s something about all that rope. It 2019s like a spectacle of labor. It just prompts this immediate, visceral reaction because of the size and the scale and the complexity. 2019 2019  Genger 2019s work is created by knotting rope in large sections, painting it in the studio, and bringing the pieces to a site to build it. She often hires crews to work with her creations, which she compares to  201cwrestling with an octopus. 2019 2019   201cWhen it gets most challenging, 2019 2019 she said,  201cis kind of when you 2019re in the thick of it. Another reason is that so many times, if something 2019s taking you a year or two to make, you grow and your ideas change but you have to stay committed to whatever you started with. 2019 2019  Capasso said that he 2019s seen Genger 2019s work in New York and also at Mass MoCA, where she was part of 2010-2011 group exhibition  201cMaterial World: Sculpture to Environment. 2019 2019 Still unclear is whether the deCordova will buy or show one of the Genger 2019s pieces, though the museum and the artist are having discussions.  At the moment, Genger said she 2019s creating a large public work commissioned for a park in New York and a piece meant to be included in the Art Basel Miami Beach, which takes place in December. She said she would love to be able to show a piece at the deCordova.   201cI adore the museum, 2019 2019 she said.  201cWhen I first went there, I thought the landscape was actually quite romantic, much more than any other museum I 2019d been to. 2019 2019 Summary: Her work has been seen everywhere from Mass MOCA, where mounds of industrial rope spilled from one gallery into another, to a New York boutique, where underwear-clad models lay inside the endless knots.

            "input": "text:This weekend, young cinephiles will eagerly anticipate which films will win best picture, best animated short and best live-action short.  And they won't even have to stay up past their bedtimes. These aren't the Oscars, and the academy in question isn't the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.  Rather, it's the Brooklyn Academy of Music, which will present its eighth annual BAMkids Film Festival, where moviegoers from preschoolers to preadolescents will vote for the best of more than 40 international films. The awards? The Bammies, of course.   A great many of our films are New York premieres,  said Suzanne Youngerman, the academy's director of education and humanities.  We also have a world premiere.  That's  Capelito: Ingenious,  in the shorts program for ages 2 to 5. Part of a Spanish series, it features an unusual hero: a little mushroom.  The festival, organized by Nicole Dreiske and presented in association with the Chicago International Children's Film Festival, also includes shorts for ages 5 to 9, 7 to 11 and 9 to 13. One for the oldest viewers,  Badgered,  is also an Oscar nominee. Actors will read the subtitles on the foreign-language entries, which include the festival's three features.  If those three have a unifying theme, it's human-animal interaction.  My Brother Is a Dog  (German, ages 5 to 10) concerns a little girl who wishes for a puppy; the title is a clue to the outcome. The heroine of  Misa Mi  (Swedish, ages 9 to 13) is a 10-year-old whose mother has died and who befriends a wolf and its cubs.  Her experience with the wolves helps her in her own maturation,  Ms. Youngerman said. In  Pelican Man  (Finnish, ages 7 to 10), a curious bird elects to become human, with mixed results.  The festival will also offer food, face-painting, Beatles music (by the band Bubble, for $5), filmmaker discussions and even moviemaking.  Kids can make a short video and take it home,  Ms. Youngerman said. So enter a fan, exit a star.  BAMkids Film Festival, tomorrow and Sunday, starting at 10 a.m., at the BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene; (718) 636-4100. Each screening: $10; ages 65+, under 13 and Cinema Club members, $7. Advance tickets: BAM.org or (718) 777-3456.  It is the eve of a new century, and a newspaper reporter visits a small town's most famous citizen to ask her what great changes she expects in the next hundred years. The woman is at first dismissive: it takes more than tearing a sheet off a calendar to transform the world, she says.  She should know: she is Harriet Tubman, and before she focuses on the 20th century, she takes the reporter and the audience on a journey through her own life in the 19th. The vehicles include one she helped create: the Underground Railroad.  This is the framework for  Steal Away: The Living History of Harriet Tubman,  a fascinating and poignant production from the New Perspectives Theater Company's World Voices Program. Although aimed at children 4 to 12, the play, by Rick Balian, is also enlightening for adults. In less than an hour, it covers Tubman's sad girlhood as a slave; her relationship with her father, who taught her to use the night sky as a map; the head injury inflicted by a cruel master, which left her prone to narcolepsy; and her rise as a leader of the Underground Railroad, where she was known, fittingly, as Moses.  Directed by Melody Brooks,  Steal Away  uses both actors and, for flashbacks, large puppets. Denise Lock plays Tubman, lending her rich voice to spirituals, which she teaches to the audience at the drama's end, explaining that the lyrics were coded messages for slaves. Brett Maughan plays the journalist, and Natalie Lebert and Miebaka Yoannes operate Sandra Eckert's papier-m 00e2ch 00e9 puppets, which children can later touch.  Near the play's conclusion, Tubman finally answers the reporter's question. I won't reveal her response, except to say that in one simple, devastating sentence, she sums up the exhausting, still unresolved struggle.   Steal Away,  tomorrow and March 11 at 11:30 a.m. at the WorkShop Theater Company, 312 West 36th Street, fourth floor, Manhattan; (212) 695-4173, ext. 5; Tickets: $10; under 12, $8; families of four or more, $6 each.  You don't usually expect to see the Cat in the Hat, Wonder Woman, the Justice League and Harry Potter performing their wizardry under the same roof. But they will be together this weekend, thanks to some other magicians: artists and animators.  They are all to be found at the Animation Pavilion of Artexpo New York. For instance, tomorrow from 3 to 5 p.m. and Sunday from 1 to 3 p.m., children will work on a big canvas alongside the animator Dick Duerrstein.  He's an amazing artist,  said Sean-Patrick M. Hillman, an expo spokesman.  His subjects are primarily Looney Tunes characters, like Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote.   Tomorrow from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., Bill Melendez, the animator who brought  Peanuts  to television, will also visit the booth. And at 1 p.m. in the expo's center court, the Cat in the Hat will preside over the unveiling of a bronze statue from Dr. Seuss. Its subject will be  a character we all know and love,  Mr. Hillman said.  The booth for the Chuck Jones Center for Creativity will hold a silent auction through Sunday to benefit Children's Hospital in New Orleans, and the Clampett Studios Booth will exhibit art related to Harry Potter. And for fans throughout the pavilion,  you've got Muppets, you've got Narnia, you've got pirates and you've got Pooh,  Mr. Hillman said.

            "input": "text:Running around the track or going for a walk around town can be great exercise but it isn't very fun or exciting. Many adults like to exercise outdoors but feel that playground activities are no longer appropriate for their age.  Well, New York City has taken the first step in creating a fun, outdoor workout environment for adults. Kids that play on playgrounds get in a good deal of exercise by just having fun. Running around, doing the monkey bars, running up the stairs as fast as you can just to slide down the slid ... there are so many exercises that can be done on a playground without really having to think about it.  But the playgrounds in many local parks are a little too small for a 200-pound man to be exercising on. A park in the Bronx decided to create a playground for adults. It is located in Macombs Dam Park. This genius idea is already being used in China and some parts of Europe where outdoor physical activity is very popular. Unfortunately, many Americans would rather sit on the couch and watch TV than go outside to a playground and perform pullups on the monkey bars. That is the goal of this playground, to get people moving.  The obesity epidemic in this country is getting out of hand and we all need to try new things to get people exercising. This idea has become so popular that many cities and parks all over the country are now adding adult playgrounds and even some other fitness equipment. The creators of these playgrounds are trying to reduce the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and cancer in many Americans by introducing exercise into their lives.  Besides introducing a more fun and exciting way of exercising, an adult playground has many other upsides to it. For starters, these playgrounds are much cheaper to build than a regular children 2019s playground. A superintendent of parks in Los Angeles says that he spends only $40,000 on an adult playground versus $300,000 spent on a child 2019s playground.  A lot of the pieces used in a children's playground are not used in the adult setting. Things such as slides, small rock climbing walls, tic-tac-toe boards, slides, and swings are not a part of an adult playground. Those are the pieces that can get pretty pricey. The adult playground is full of stationary equipment such as pull up bars, dip machines, and incline benches.  Many people think that to get in shape or lose weight that they need a ton of fancy fitness equipment or a gym membership. Both can get pretty expensive. One of the greatest things about the adult playground is that it is free and it's open to the public. Though you may not have all the equipment at the playground that you may find in the gym, you have all that you need for a full body workout.  ThePostGame brings you the most interesting sports stories on the web.  Follow us on Facebook and Twitter to read them first!  Social support is another great benefit of an adult outdoor playground. If you have a buddy that wants to get in shape with you but can 2019t afford the gym you go to, it's much easier to meet up at the park and work out together on the playground. Many people have actually been using the playground as their friendly get together rather than sitting around drinking coffee.  It's great for parents with small children. Many of the adult playgrounds are purposely placed next to the children's playgrounds so that parents can get in a workout while their children are playing on the playground. Some playgrounds are even combined with an  adult  only area. The great thing about the New York playgrounds is because of the law against adults using playgrounds without small children. This gives the adults their own playground without getting in trouble for using the children's.  Some outdoor gyms are even getting cardio equipment such as ellipticals and stationary bikes. These playgrounds offer a great environment with fresh air, no TVs, and a beautiful scenery. You can't get any of that in a stuffy gym.  Another advancements is that some outdoor playgrounds are starting to use green energy. Want to have the ability to provide electricity to lights at a park or some local buildings? Try out a green energy gym. These outdoor gyms create energy by bikes or ellipticals. Not only will you be working out your own body but you can provide energy to buildings and the park. The coolest thing is seeing the lights at the park light up as your pedaling.  Adults of all ages and fitness levels can use these outdoor playgrounds. You don't have to be in perfect physical condition to workout at the playground. One of the greatest things is the friendly environment. Many people at the playground in the Bronx reported that strangers were helping other strangers out with some exercises and using some of the equipment. Unlike in the gym where young teens are paid to stand there and say hi to you, these playgrounds are full of genuinely nice people that want to help you get fit and healthy.  Now that it is summer, switch up your fitness routine and head to an adult fitness park. If there isn't one near you, use a children's playground to start. Hopefully this fitness trend will really take off and every town will invest in an adult playground.  Many adults need to start moving and exercising to fight the obesity epidemic. Everyone needs to get out more and a playground is perfect. Take a trip back to your childhood and burn calories while you're doing it.

More bills to meet the total target of 5.8 billion euros ($7.5 billion) Cyprus needs to secure an international bailout will be brought for a vote during the weekend. They include a crucial one that would impose a tax of less than 1 percent on all bank deposits, said Averof Neophytou, deputy head of the governing DISY party.  2018 2018We are voting for the least worst option, 2019 2019 Neophytou said in a speech.  2018 2018We owe an apology to the Cypriot people because we all share in the responsibility of bringing this place to this state. 2019 2019",

A statement issued by the commission 2019s staff Wednesday afternoon said executives at South Shore and Boston-based Partners, which owns Massachusetts General and Brigham and Women 2019s hospitals, were notified that the commission will examine how the proposed merger of the two health care providers is likely to affect costs and the overall health care market.  Its preliminary inquiry found that  201cgiven Partners 2019 size and high costs, an expansion of the system to include South Shore Hospital, a large, high-cost community hospital, is likely to have a significant impact on the Commonwealth 2019s ability to meet its health care cost growth goals, and on the competitive market, 201d the commission 2019s statement said.  The commission was created by last year 2019s state health cost containment law as a watchdog to monitor changes in the health care business. It was formed at a time when providers had been banding together to better coordinate care, while insurers had been shifting toward fixed payments for overall patient care, rather than reimbursements for individual doctors 2019 visits, tests, and procedures. The state law set a goal of tying the overall increase in medical spending to the growth in the state economy, which is projected to be 3.6 percent this year.  It was widely expected that the commission staff would review the Partners-South Shore alliance, the largest merger now underway. The commission 2019s executive director, David Seltz, is set to report to the 11-member panel on June 19 regarding the staff 2019s initial findings. The commission will then determine whether to move forward with a more extensive review.  The proposed acquisition has been approved by the state Department of Public Health, which last month granted a license to transfer ownership of the 378-bed Weymouth hospital to Partners. But the transaction can 2019t be completed until 30 days after the commission issues its final report. The commission has no authority to block a merger, but it can refer its findings to the attorney general 2019s office for potential further action.  The US Justice Department has also been examining the deal.  The commission is set to decide by June 6 whether to review two other hospital merger deals: Mass General 2019s proposed takeover of Cooley Dickinson Hospital in Northampton, and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 2019s plan for a clinical affiliation with Cambridge Health Alliance.

            "input": "text:A lot of New Yorkers have clamored for the furniture Bart Bettencourt and Carlos Salgado make in their Brooklyn factory, yet nobody wanted the raw materials they used.  The pair's sleek, striped pieces, which have attracted the notice of ABC Carpet & Home, are made from wood scraps from other Brooklyn furniture makers and Steinway & Sons piano factory in Long Island City, Queens.  Recycling wood from the refuse pile brings a green cachet to Scrapile, the Greenpoint business started by the pair, who met a decade ago when both worked at the Guggenheim Museum's SoHo wood shop. But the eye-catching designs and craftsmanship that mark their work has the business on track to be a success. And free materials sure help the bottom line.   This project is about local reclamation-based manufacturing,  said Salgado,39, a Parsons School of Design grad raised in Bogot 00e1, Colombia. When he met Bettencourt, a Trinity College English major with a knack for carpentry, Salgado was an art handler. Bettencourt was on the construction crew.   We were both blown away at the amount of material that would get thrown away,  said Bettencourt, 34.  Later, Bettencourt rented warehouse space in Williamsburg and launched a line of furniture made from renewable resources like bamboo and wheat board, which he soon found were hard to get and costly.   We were buying small amounts of material for the furniture, and paying crazy prices,  he said.  He began to wonder if he should make furniture out of scrap wood instead. In September 2003, right before Firstop, a walking tour of Williamsburg design studios, he sat down with Salgado, who was also making furniture.  They filled a notebook with ideas - and built a bench and a stool in time for the show. Those two designs became staples of their furniture line.  At first, they were frustrated turning scraps into workable material. Then Ted Badea, a woodworking expert in Greenpoint, told them how to shape discards into blocks 8-inches wide by 10-feet long.  The pair also got help from the nonprofit East Williamsburg Valley Industrial Development Corp., where they took a course on running a small business.  Their retail prices range from $400 for a stool to $3,600 for a dining room table. Locally, the furniture is available at The Future Perfect, a Williamsburg shop.  Sales for the first half of this year have surpassed last year's $85,000 total, though Scrapile hasn't yet turned a profit.  One big issue: the company, which employs four woodworkers, has a small wood shop - just 2,000 square feet of the Greenpoint warehouse it shares with Bettencourt's building supply company. They'd like to double that.   With more space and machinery, we could quadruple our sales,  said Bettencourt, who said they're talking to HSBC about a line of credit to expand.  Rent for the Freeman Street facility is just under $10 a square foot - and the lease is expiring soon.  Bettencourt anticipates they'll have to pay $14 to $18 a square foot for their next place. They could get space for half as much just a few miles away in New Jersey, but they're determined to stay in Brooklyn.  On a recent morning, they had the shop's roll-up gate open to let in fresh air.  And above the buzz of an electric sander, a stereo blared a Donald Byrd funk song with this refrain:  Change means just rearrange.  Summary: With a lot of creativity, a Brooklyn duo manufactures popular high-end furniture using wood others throw away.",

            "input": "text:More than two dozen countries, from Romania to Vietnam and Israel have switched from old-fashioned cotton paper notes to polymer ones. Recently, The Bank of England announced that the Sir Winston Churchill  00a35 note will be made with plastic in 2016. Fiji and Canada also ditched their crinkly paper notes for plastic in 2013. And Australia, which pioneered plastic-based money, has successfully used the notes since the late 1980s.  These newer, non-paper notes are meant to be more secure and to last longer than paper-based bills. There are some drawbacks to the new-fangled money, too (have you ever tried to fold plastic in a wallet?).  Here 2019s what you need to know.  The polymer-based notes are made from a thin, clear plastic film that can be printed on like paper. By turning to plastic, central banks worldwide will be able to slow the movement of faked currency by adopting high-tech security devices, such as holograms and see-through windows that contain hard-to-forge images. These tools make counterfeiting, which plagues countries like China and Peru (which do not use polymer-based banknotes), harder than it currently is with cotton paper notes.   201cThe technology for counterfeiting is rapidly advancing, 201d said George Cubaj, editor of the Standard Catalog of World Paper Money.  201cTo be secure, money has to stay on top of new technologies. 201d  Besides being more secure, the new banknotes are also tough  2014 and potentially cleaner than paper money, which is alive with bacteria. Paper-based money, for instance, can transfer live flu viruses for up to 17 days. The new notes can last longer too: at least 2.5 times as long as paper currency 2014a typical five-dollar bill has an estimated life of 4.9 years, while a 20-dollar bill lasts an estimated 7.7 years, according to the US Federal Reserve. Another benefit of the plastic -based currency is that it can also be recycled and survive searing heat and freezing temperatures.   201cPolymer notes can withstand heat as high as 140 degrees Celsius, 201d said Richard Wall, the director of currency at the Bank of Canada.  201cAnd you can even clean them by wiping them down with water. 201d  Sun spots and wallet woes  These new notes aren 2019t without problems.  Nigeria, which is still a largely cash-based society, is going back to old-fashioned cotton paper cash this year. The country began testing low-denomination polymer notes in 2007. But the ink on the notes faded under the blazing sun experienced year-round in the African country  2014 and Nigerian bus conductors and other merchants began rejecting the blurry notes.  Polymer currencies also suffer from another problem: they don 2019t always stay folded.   201cThey have memory and can spring back from being flat, 201d said Cubaj. That was a problem in parts of Thailand, he added, where it 2019s traditional to fold banknotes. Other people complain that the new notes are slippery and stick together.  For now, some big countries like the United States are sticking with their paper money. There are no plans for the US to convert paper dollars into plastic ones, said Cubaj. One reason: the exorbitant cost to replace the high number of vending machines nationwide so that they would take the new polymer notes, he said.  What 2019s more, US dollars are also already coveted in their current form and hoarded globally because they 2019re seen as the safest, most stable currency. Despite the rapid rise in digital payment options, in year-end 2013, the amount of US currency in circulation soared to a record $1.23 trillion, up from $1.16 trillion the year before, according to the Federal Reserve.  Although Cubaj believes plastic currency is here to stay, he conceded that people will continue to stash money under their mattresses at home or keep paper bills in their safety deposit boxes.   201cCash is a comfort zone for people, 201d he said. Summary: The notes people carry in their wallets may not always be made from paper. What you need to know  00e2 0080 0094 the good and bad  00e2 0080 0094 about high-tech plastic currency.",

            "input": "text:Gov. HICKS has published an address to the citizens of Maryland, giving his reasons for refusing to convene the Legislature. It fills two columns of the American, and abounds in the most emphatic Union sentiments. The following are extracts:  I firmly believe that a division of this Government would inevitably produce civil war. The secession leaders in South Carolina, and the fanatical demagogues of the North, have alike proclaimed that such would be the result, and no man of sense, in my opinion, can question it. What could the Legislature do in this crisis, if convened, to remove the present troubles which beset the Union? We are told by the leading spirits of the South Carolina Convention that neither the election of Mr. LINCOLN nor the non-execution of the Fugitive Slave law, nor both combined, constitute their grievances. They declare that the real cause of their discontent dates as far back as 1833. Maryland and every other State in the Union with a united voice, then declared the cause insufficient to justify the course of South Carolina. Can it be that this people, who then unanimously supported the cause of Gen. JACKSON, will now yield their opinions at the bidding of modern Secessionists? I have been told that the position of Maryland should be defined so that both sections can understand it. Do any really misunderstand her position? Who that wishes to understand it can fail to do so? If the action of the Legislature would be simply to declare that Maryland is with the South in sympathy and feeling; that she demands from the North the repeal of offensive, unconstitutional statutes, and appeals to it for new guarantees; that she will wait a reasonable time for the North to purge her statute-books, as to do justice to her Southern brethren, and if her appeals are vain, will make her common cause with her sister border States in resistance to tyranny if need be, it would only be saying what the whole country well knows, and what may be said much more effectually by her people themselves, in their meetings, than by the Legislature, chosen eighteen months since, when none of these questions were raised before them. That Maryland is a conservative Southern State all know who know anything of her people or her history. The business, and agricultural classes, planters, merchants, mechanics and laboring men; those who have a real stake in the community, who would be forced to pay the taxes and do the fighting, are the persons who should be heard in preference to excited politicians, many of whom, having nothing to lose from the destruction of the Government, may hope to derive some gain from the ruin of the State. Such men will naturally urge you to pull down the pillars of this  accursed Union,  which their allies at the North have denominated a  a covenant with hell.  The people of Maryland, if left to themselves, would decide, with scarcely an exception, that there is nothing in the present causes of complaint to justify immediate secession, and yet against our judgments and solemn convictions of duty we are to be precipitated into this revolutian, because South Carolina thinks differently. Are we not equals? Or shall her opinions control our actions? After we have solemnly declared for ourselves, as every man must do, are we to be forced to yield our opinions to those of another State, and thus in effect obey her mandates? She refuses to wait for our counsels. Are we bound to obey her commands? The men who have embarked in this scheme to convene the Legislature will spare no pains to carry their point. The whole plan of operations, in the event of the assembling of the Legislature, is, as I have been informed, already marked out, the list of ambassadors who are to visit the other States is agreed on, and the resolutions which they hope will be passed by the Legislature, fully committing this State to secession, are said to be already prepared. In the course of nature, I cannot have long to live, and I fervently trust to be allowed to end my days a citizen of this glorious Union. But should I be compelled to witness the downfall of that Government inherited from our fathers, established, as it were, by the special favor of God. I will at least have the consolation [at my dying hour that I neither by word or deed assisted in hastening its disruption. Summary: Gov.

            "input": "text:Bertha Alicia contemplates the portrait of her murdered daughter, Brenda Berenice, at first with little expression on her face. Then she nods approvingly, turns to the wall of her little home in Ciudad Ju 00e1rez, Mexico, and takes down a picture of a chicken from Looney Tunes that is hanging there, and puts the portrait in its place. It is as though the dead Brenda had, in some form, returned home.  Brenda is one of some 1,400 factory girls working in Ju 00e1rez who have been abducted, violated, mutilated and killed since the so-called feminocidio began in 1994. The scene, which arrives towards the end of Blood Rising, a new documentary about the slaughter by director Mark McLoughlin, is so poignant one has to turn away from the screen. Brian Maguire, the Irish artist who painted the portrait of Brenda for her mother, and who collaborated on the film with McLoughlin, clearly feels similarly. In the scene, he stands ill at ease as Bertha thanks him for the portrait and hugs him; the embrace is utterly sincere, almost desperate, from both sides.   Brian was so relieved, he hugged her so hard he nearly strangled her,  says McLoughlin. In an earlier scene, mother and painter had sat together on a sofa talking about Brenda's life and death, and they joined hands. Then they continued to sit, intimately but awkwardly, not knowing what to do, not wanting to let go.  I know that feeling, from reporting the feminocidio for this newspaper and later for a book  2013 that of total but unbearable immersion in this appalling narrative. So does any writer, film-maker, painter who confronts this depth of depravity.  There have been several attempts  2013 on screen and on the page  2013 to convey the horror and the disbelief of the feminocidio and the humbling defiance of the dead girls' mothers. But McLoughlin's film is in a class of its own in showing and handling not only the barbarism of its subject matter, but its delicacy, and the sensitivities inherent in covering it at all. As Maguire learned while painting portraits of prisoners in the jails of Ireland, as he did for many years, the sitters stay, he goes home. Narrators of stories of this kind, if they care, have a fear of exploiting grief as they walk the high wire between narrative and voyeurism. For the first time in a report on the feminocidio by foreigners, manipulation is entirely absent from the telling.  This is in part due to the craftsmanship of its visual narration. And it's in part due to the extraordinary undertaking of the film's  presenter , Maguire, who tasked himself to paint (in a way that becomes all-consuming, almost obsessive) portraits of scores of these murdered girls. These portraits he then presented to the girls' mothers.  Blood Rising was premiered in Dublin last year at a packed screening presented by a mother called Elia Escobedo Garc 00eda whose 29-year-old daughter, Erika, was one of those abducted, tortured and murdered. The Dublin screening was followed by another in Galway at which Elia and the director broke down, leaving the  entire audience in tears , as McLoughlin recalls. Its UK premiere was at the Soho Curzon last month; soon it will tour Britain, presented by Elia and Bertha Alicia, mother of Brenda Berenice Castillo Garc 00eda.  Stories about the feminocidio in Ciudad Ju 00e1rez emerged slowly during the late 1990s, not least because media and observers across the border in America were unable to grasp serial violence of this nature and scale. By 2002, when I went to report the story, 340 young women had been murdered in ways that beggared belief. The figure of murdered women has now reached 1,400. Equally but differently shocking was the response of the local, state and national authorities: they were not merely indifferent, but blocked any attempt to track the killers. There were convincing signs that these authorities were sometimes behind the death threats to any mother or activist who tried to seek justice.  The girls were invariably captured while running errands in the centre of town, or on their way to or from work in the hundreds of maquiladoras: sweatshop assembly plants that constitute the economy of Ju 00e1rez, manufacturing (for rock-bottom wages) the goods that America and Europe deem essential to keep their supermarket shelves and car-concession outlets stocked. The reactions to the killings of their employees by the multinational corporations that own the factories has ranged from callous indifference to offensive disregard.  One 16-year-old, sexually assaulted and murdered, was last seen in a police station. And after the murder of Erika Perez Escobedo a modest monument was built, later bulldozed into the dust. In McLoughlin's film, Erika's mother, Elia, lays flowers on the rubble left behind. The murdered girls are blamed for going out alone and their parents for allowing them.  The message,  says Maguire,  is that here you can kill working-class women with impunity.   By the close of 2007, the slaughter of these women became subsumed within the wider carnage of Mexico's drug war, which has to date claimed some 100,000 lives, with an estimated 20,000 missing, and which for many years made Ju 00e1rez the murder capital of the world.  There were connections between the feminocidio and the drug war. First, in what Mexican-American anthropologist and writer Cecilia Ball 00ed calls the  style of killing , whereby the perverse ferocity of the narco war (its mutilations and decapitations) seems to have been  predicted  by that of the feminocidio. Second, and more directly, some of the murders of women seemed to have been committed by members of an embryonic branch of the Ju 00e1rez narco-trafficking cartel called La L 00ednea, the Line, whose executioners overlapped with local police forces.  Among the many themes with which Blood Rising grapples is that the feminocidio, far from being ended by the narco war, continued and continues within it. Appearing in the film, Julian Cardona, a former maquiladora worker-turned-photographer, stands at the rubbish dump where the first body was found in 1994. He says:  It begins here. It continues and it doesn't look like it's going to stop.   Brian Maguire was born in Dublin, to a family from Fermanagh in Northern Ireland, in 1951. In the early years of the Troubles, he joined the leftist Official IRA, from which the militant Provisionals split in 1969, and which declared an early ceasefire in 1972.  Maguire started exhibiting during the 1980s, depicting what one of his exhibition catalogues called  various incarcerated groups on the island of Ireland, from mental hospitals to prisons . Critics refer to Maguire's style as  neoexpressionist , meaning, presumably, that his paintings stand in defiance of what another catalogue calls the  ragbag of postmodernism , favouring instead emotional gravitas and physical mass. Maguire, compelled towards the raw realities of prisons and mental institutions, describes himself as  entirely outside that new British school of art which has left reality, [which is] all kitsch and commodity . Maguire is substance, the real thing.  His portraits deploy bold strokes. His palettes superimpose cold greys and greens on to warm pink flesh to depict a blighted, often sepulchral human species. Suddenly, there'll be a head sculptured in charcoal and blue gouache, deep-toned and severe, but beautiful. One of his prison projects was a residency for the 1998 Bienal in S 00e3o Paulo, Brazil; reflecting the haunting aftermath of a prison riot, Maguire painted bodies in boxes against vortices of grey masonry and vast but stifling space.  Maguire says he tries to work within his own rules of commercial engagement  2013  to be in situations,  as he describes it to me,  where there is no charge for the paintings themselves. This is work for which I am paid a wage, and the painting itself has no value to me. It is free to the person whom I've painted. There've been occasions when the paintings ended up in auctions  2013 but it's the prisoner selling the work, not me.   Around a decade after the S 00e3o Paulo residency, his Ju 00e1rez project began. Maguire was there, not for the customary weeks and months that reporters like me invest, but for four years.  When I heard about what was happening in Ju 00e1rez,  says Maguire,  I figured, of course  2013 women come below men, poor come below rich, brown comes below white and Mexico comes below America. They don't fucking count, and that is why they die.  He says he learned that  these people wanted their story told, in the event of their being no justice for them. The only thing they ask is that the memory of their daughters, and the actions done to them, not disappear with their deaths.   In the case of Brenda Berenice Castillo Garc 00eda, Maguire says:  I was in a state of cold fury. Here was a 16-year-old, the age at which women in Ju 00e1rez begin to make families. But unlike women in the Netherlands or France, the law is not applied [in Brenda's case], she is denied maternity leave and laid off by her employer, Philips, because she's pregnant. There's no money for milk to give baby Kevin, so she goes in search of work at a jewellery store  2013 and disappears.   Maguire made his Ju 00e1rez portraits in pairs, one to exhibit, the other for the families to keep. They are more intimate and closely focused than his previous work, lighter of touch, but no less impactful. Two years into the project, he was joined in Mexico by director McLoughlin. Together they started filming Blood Rising.   The killings of these women in Ju 00e1rez were not tit-for-tat killings,  says McLoughlin.  They are killings at a level of psychic perversion I simply couldn't understand. And that was the challenge. We had to take this on board emotionally. We built relationships with the mothers and families, but all the time this anger and fear was building up, frustration and bewilderment. And you take on the fear and grief of the people themselves, until sometimes you'd hit an emotional brick wall, out of exhaustion. Brian would call me up and say, 'I've been crying, have you?' And I'd answer, 'Yes, I have.'   In the film, we learn little details of the horrors: Erika Perez Escobedo was found in the street, strangled, her underwear disturbed; Guadalupe Ver 00f3nica Castro Pando was abused and drugged for 21 days, and her left breast was cut off before she was buried alive. But the film is really about struggle and defiance, not the crimes themselves.  The mothers bring us on a journey back,  says Maguire,  to where their daughters were murdered, where they were found, what the state did and did not do.  Violence is not the subject of this film; the subject is the surviving mothers, families and friends and their struggle to live on.   Most work,  Maguire says in the film,  is a negotiation, most work is an exchange... [One in which] you have to give something back.  During a Q&A with the audience after the London screening of Blood Rising, he added that the murdered girls' families  were in our hands, and we were in their hands too. They had to trust that we would not exploit them .  In conversation with me, Maguire expands on this.  You have to bring some value to the place and people, which gives you the right to work there. And that value can be negotiated. For a start, I can take their story outside Mexico, and tell it to Europe 2026 I can campaign for them by showing my paintings in museums 2026 I try to give something to their children.  The artist not only paints the portraits, he also teaches the children of the murdered girls. One of the film's most heart-rending scenes shows one of these art classes and the joy these children experience when painting.  After years of conversation with the mother of one victim, Maguire says:  I have some idea as regard [the victim's] personality. And I also have a photographic image. I felt that if I had some relationship with their relatives, then, and only then, I could paint their portraits.   There is something talismanic about Maguire's recreations by portrait. In the film, we see him pacing around his studio in which he based himself across the border in El Paso, Texas, covering its walls with victims' photographs, writing their names in enraged grief, and setting to work.  Watching Blood Rising and talking to Maguire, a thought occurred to me, forcefully. Mexico is a country in which the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe is more important to most people than God himself. Popular faith in Mexico tends to be  folk Catholicism ; it is by no means entirely separated from Aztec and Mayan beliefs, nor the lore and deities that preceded the Hispanic Christianity that incorporated them. Popular faith in Mexico is sensitive to the occult, the veil between the living and the dead thin. The image, the icon, is everything.  Painting two portraits of each selected victim, Maguire often seems to create one of a girl's life and the other of her death; one portraying effervescence, the other murder. This is the case with Brenda. The first portrait, in monochrome, shows her features distorted only slightly but in such a way that vividly and disconcertingly seems to convey her doom. Another, in colour, exudes the life of the young woman. Brenda's mother, recounts Maguire,  saw the black-and-white picture, but she wanted something that recalled her living child. She had another photograph, from school days  2013 and from that I painted the second in colour, which she put on the wall. However, I did notice a copy of the first on her dresser  2013 I felt strangely gratified that she wanted that portrait too, but privately.   There are two ways to report or film crimes such as the Ju 00e1rez feminocidio. One is to convey some distant horror, exotic in its way, in places or circumstances separated from our own by Manichaean morality; some evil in Mexico, against which our legitimate society, appalled, campaigns or crusades.  The other way is to insist  2013 as writers such as Roberto Saviano in Italy or Anabel Hern 00e1ndez in Mexico do, and as Maguire does passionately in this film  2013 that these atrocious narratives are integral to our own routines; that the blood stains our everyday lives; that  this is not another world , as Maguire told his audience during the Soho Q&A,  it is directly connected to our world, in fact it is our world. It's right under the bonnet of your car.   When we sit down to talk he says:  Ju 00e1rez is not happenstance, it's part of an economic construct, our economic construct. These girls make those things like the electrical distributors in cars, they make all the junk  2013 everything  2013 we use all the time. Ju 00e1rez is a city that does not care about its people, [who are] human fodder for the factories. They're now building a new factory to make iPads and things, 25 miles out in the desert from Ju 00e1rez. That's 50 miles a day by bus for the workers to and from a place with no shops, nothing but the factory, to be paid less now than they were 10 years ago. It's our system. It's the telephone I talk on.   And in this statement lies the final, haunting theme in Blood Rising and in Maguire's art  2013 which happens to be the story of my own life: the feeling of ineffectuality, the impotent pointlessness of this work; these films, these paintings, writing articles, books, whatever. On his last night at work on the portraits, Maguire recalls:  I was having dinner alone in the safety of El Paso. After four years, it was over. There were two emotions: one happy, that I'd had the experience, and that we'd made the film. But also: it's worthless, it's meaningless, it's nothing. We are totally ineffective.   The mothers have been glad to see us, and I'll tell their story. But there is this sense of total helplessness. All I know for certain is that more poor factory girls will die in Ciudad Ju 00e1rez, and that those iPads will be all shiny and new. So I went back to Ju 00e1rez in despair and Julian Cardona, the photographer, rescued me. 'Look, Brian,' he said, 'let's just do our work as best we can, shall we?'  Summary: Since 1994, more than 1,400 women in Ciudad Ju 00e1rez, Mexico, have been murdered. Brian Maguire set out to paint portraits of some of the victims. Ed Vulliamy reports",

Concerns that the fashion company 2019s days of torrid growth could be soon coming to an end evaporated after Kors on Monday reported stronger than expected comparable sales in North America and Europe and raised its sales and profit forecast for the fiscal year.  Since going public in late 2011, Kors has been a Wall Street favorite, reporting quarter after quarter of double-digit sales gains and snatching away many of Coach 2019s COH customers with its handbags, eyewear and shoes. But shares, which rose in premarket trading, came under intense pressure last month when several Wall Street firms put out notes saying they were seeing much more Kors merchandise on discount and that the retailer was slower to refresh its assortment. As of the close of trading on Friday, Kors shares were about 20% below a 52-week high.  They needn 2019t have worried: Kors reported total revenue rose 43.4% to $919.2 million in the first fiscal quarter ended June 28. That includes an 18.7% increase in comparable sales in North America, by far its biggest market, and above the 17.6% Wall Street analysts were expecting, according to Consensus Metrix. (In contrast, Coach, which is in the middle of radical reset to win big its customers, is expected to report a 21% drop in North America when it reports its results on Tuesday.)  What 2019s more, Kors 2019 gross profit margin rose slightly, increased 0.2 percentage points to 62.2% of sales, likely meaning Kors did not have to resort to as much price cutting as feared. Kors 2019 European comparable sales rose 54.2%, an encouraging sign for what is a nearly untapped market so far for the company and one in which Coach has only a tiny presence.  Kors now expects revenues of $4.25 billion to $4.35 billion for the fiscal year that will end in late March, $250 million more than in its initial forecast. It also raised its profit forecast.  A few weeks ago, veteran retail analyst Robin Lewis predicted the Kors brand would at some point crash because of its aggressive expansion:  201cMichael Kors, the brand, is becoming ubiquitous, and that 2019s the kiss of death for trendy fashion brands, particularly those positioned in the up-market younger consumer sectors, 201d Lewis wrote in a blog post.  And while it looks like the Kors party will continue for at least a little while longer, several analysts on Twitter pointed out a detail in the retailer 2019s results that could portend trouble later on: Sales inventories rose 65% compared to a year earlier, far outstripping sales growth, and therefore setting the company up for potentially having to discount, discount, discount if its locomotive starts running out of steam. And on the call, executives warned investors that its gross margin at its own stores would fall in the coming quarters because of more discounting 201d Summary: Fashion company also raises its sales and profit forecast for the fiscal year.",

A new generation of architects and designers have decided that there 2019s no reason prefab houses can 2019t look great and be of high quality.  Turns out, prefab may be the most environmentally friendly way to build a house. When a house is built in a factory there 2019s less waste  2014 materials can be precision measured and cut  2014 plus a prefab structure can be erected within a couple of weeks  2014 avoiding months and months of workmen driving greenhouse gas spewing trucks to the site. One speaker at Fortune 2019s Brainstorm Green conference earlier this year, Bill Haney  2014 founder and CEO of Blu Homes, cited another advantage of prefab housing:  201cNo one can build a traditional house on time or on budget. Psychology Today cited a study that said it 2019s more painful to build a house than it is to have a loved one die. 201d  Haney has added a high-tech element to his prefab green houses. Applying technology developed at MIT, Blu Homes designs its modern structures using steel frames that fold on hinges much like a card table. Today, most prefab homes must be delivered at great expense on wide-load trucks that are too big to travel on many roads and have to be accompanied by escort cars. A Blue Home, by contrast, can be folded up to fit on an 18-wheeler, allowing the house to be shipped relatively cheaply and easily from the company 2019s factory in Vallejo, Calif.  MORE: The return of the BlackBerry believers  Another advantage: Because traditional prefab houses are shipped in boxy modules that need to fit on a truck, there 2019s a limit on the size of rooms and heights of ceilings. A Blu Home can unfold into large rooms with soaring cathedral ceilings.  The houses range from the modest 465 sq ft Origin for $130,000 (not including foundation and site prep) to the elegant, California modern 3,000 sq. ft Breeze house, which starts at $540,000. As for its green credentials, Blu Homes use non-off-gassing materials (including low or no VOC paints) and materials that are formaldehyde-free. The homes are highly insulated and with the addition of solar panels energy costs can be dramatically cut.  The company has raised $69 million and is backed by, among others, the Disney DIS family and the Scandinavian investment company Skagen Group. The company says it expects to sell more than 100 homes this year nationwide. Blu Homes, which is not yet profitable, says it booked sales last year of $40 million and is on track to hit $70 million this year. When asked what keeps him up nights, Haney replied:  201cMy biggest worry is keeping up with the fast growth and at the same time maintaining quality. 201d That 2019s a problem a lot of CEOs would like to have. Summary: Blu 00a0Home's environmentally friendly pre-fab houses can be folded to fit onto an 18-wheeler.",

            "input": "text:In recent attempts to stimulate the European economy and fight deflation, the European Central Bank (ECB), led by President Mario Draghi, has cut its benchmark interest rate to 0.05%, and said it would buy  20ac1 trillion (about $1.25 trillion) in asset-backed securities and bonds.  These changes in monetary policy sent the Euro below $1.24 in early November, its weakest in over two years, making European goods and tourism less expensive abroad. This did not lead to rejoicing on the streets of European cities, however.   201cThey ought to encourage consumption to reactivate the economy, 201d said Luis Carrasco,42, as he stood in front of a Barcelona restaurant where he is a chef.  Many economists would argue that people like Carrasco do not understand that the ECB is doing just that, albeit indirectly; lowering rates and buying assets should get credit flowing, which in turn should increase house prices and household spending.  But another school is arguing that Carrasco is exactly right, and that what European households need is not contorted monetary policy changes but, rather, an influx of cold, hard cash. The ECB should send each European adult a check, they say, and let him spend it how he likes.  John Muellbauer, a professor of economics at the University of Oxford who recently published a piece titled,  201cQuantitative Easing for the People, 201d says that sending  20ac500 euro checks to every EU citizen would cost a sixth of the  20ac1 trillion Draghi talks about spending on asset purchases, and would increase EU consumer spending by  20ac34 billion, or 1.4% of GDP.  London-based fund manager Eric Lonergan, along with Brown University professor Mark Blyth wrote the recent Foreign Affairs article  201cPrint Less but Transfer More, 201d which argues that transfers of between  20ac500 and  20ac1,000 per capita would have a far greater effect on consumption than the ECB 2019s plans.   201cIt 2019s much more efficient and sensible to directly target household spending, 201d Lonergan says.  While stimulating the economy via society-wide handouts may seem silly or simplistic, it 2019s an idea with a long history. In the 1936 economics classic General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, John Maynard Keynes suggested that the treasury could juice the economy by burying bottles of cash in coal mines and having people dig them up.  And on the other side of the political spectrum, Milton Friedman noted in his essay  201cThe Optimum Quantity of Money 201d that dropping cash to people from a helicopter would have a similar effect.   201cIt 2019s funny that the left and the right are unified on this policy, 201d jokes Muellbauer.  But while Keynes and Friedman were speaking with tongue in cheek, governments have performed a kind of cash handouts in the recent past. During slow economic times in 2001 and 2008, the U.S. gave out tax rebates, giving economists a chance to study the effect handouts would have.  While much economic theory holds that people would not spend the money, the opposite happened. According to a study from the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), households spent between 20% and 40% of their rebates on non-durable goods, like food, during the three-month period in which they received their checks, and they spent another third of the rebate during the following quarter. The poor spent more than the rich.  And in 2008, another NBER report found that households spent between 50% and 90% during the quarter they received the rebate. The spending was on a mix of non-durable and durable goods (particularly cars).  Two of the beauties of the giveaway approach, says Lonergan, are that it would be applied equally to all EU citizens, no matter the country, and it would let people do what they want with their money instead of pushing them to buy assets, as cheap credit does.   201cIf I 2019m a Spanish or Italian household and I 2019m in a bad situation, I 2019ll use it to improve my situation, 201d he says.  201cIf I have debt, I will use it to repay it. If I have more money, I may take a holiday or put it in a pension fund. Sometimes it 2019s good to let people to do what they want. They know what 2019s best for them. 201d  The idea that people would spend the money (instead of putting it under the mattress) 2014and in a variety of ways 2014was backed up on the streets of Barcelona.   201cIn Spain, the majority of us have debts, so we 2019d use it to pay debt, 201d said Juan Galera,53, a self-employed mason working in the Tres Torres neighborhood.  201cI 2019d use it to pay one mortgage payment. 201d  Several blocks away, Pepi, who was cleaning the sidewalk outside of a dental clinic, said if she received a check, she would buy food and use it to pay her rent and electricity bills.  Of course, after years of pushing austerity policies, no one expects the EU 2019s greatest economic power, Germany, to embrace a handout scheme any time soon. And there is another problem with the plan: while the idea was well received, a  20ac500 handout wasn 2019t exactly embraced as a panacea.   201cWould it solve the crisis? That 2019s another question.  20ac500 doesn 2019t go very far, 201d said Galera.  Pepi, who did not to give her last name, was more pointed.   201cJust  20ac500? 201d she asked.  201cMore would be a little better, no? 201d Summary: A school of economists have begun to argue that what European households need is not contorted monetary policy changes but, rather, an influx of cold, hard cash.",

This is a pretty new area of the company, so there aren 2019t any old job descriptions around here that I could use as a template, and the ones I 2019ve been looking at online are mostly so boring. Is it crazy to think that, since we 2019re looking for dynamic, imaginative people to do interesting, creative work, the job description should be interesting and creative too? Do you or your readers have any suggestions?  2014 Just Janet  Dear J.J.: Not crazy at all.  201cJob descriptions are usually just an item on a hiring manager 2019s checklist, so they end up as a dry list of qualifications, 201d explains Brendan Browne, director of recruiting at LinkedIn. That 2019s a wasted opportunity.  201cCandidates in demand now have a choice of jobs, so how are you going to stand out? 201d he says.  201cThe right description is often your first, and best, chance to catch the eye of the right talent. 201d  Browne has had some experience with this. When he started at LinkedIn in 2010, the social media site had about 500 employees. It now has over 6,0, in 30 cities worldwide. Here are a few of LinkedIn 2019s tips for writing a job ad that will wow the people you want to attract:  Use recognizable titles.  201cCreative 201d titles  2014 like Office Ninja for administrative assistant, or Brand Champion when you mean social media specialist  2014 aren 2019t search-friendly, and will likely put off anyone who doesn 2019t know what they mean.  Keep the tone candid and conversational. Lots of ads feature a heading like  201cJob Overview, 201d followed by two or three paragraphs of jargon. Yawn. Instead, Browne recommends getting quickly to the point, with  201cWhy Join Us? 201d followed by two or three sentences that answer the question.  Likewise, long lists of  201cJob Requirements 201d in some ads often include a veiled reference to a drawback of the job, buried in verbiage. That 2019s a mistake.  201cIt 2019s essential that the ad reflect the reality, 201d Browne notes.  201cIf there is something that makes this role especially tough or challenging, say it as if you were speaking to the person. Put in a  2018Worst Part of the Job 2019 sub-head. 201d  LinkedIn, for instance, is growing so fast that a few basic processes aren 2019t fully developed yet and have to be improvised on the fly. If something like that is true in your shop too, briefly say so.  201cBe authentic about the job, 201d says Browne.  201cYou want no surprises for new hires later. 201d  Promote your company 2019s brand. When LinkedIn surveyed 18,000 employees across various industries on what would lure them to a new job, 56% said an employer 2019s job-market brand was a big influence.  201cPeople want to love where they work, so why someone would love working with you has got to come screaming through, 201d Browne says. It helps to replace a typically dull list of details about the company 2019s history with two or three sentences explaining why your business is exciting now.  Avoid buzzwords. Instead of eye-glazing boilerplate like  201cFits well with our culture and the values consistent in our organization, 201d offer information about the actual culture at your company  2014 maybe by mentioning why you like coming to work in the morning.  Emphasize the impact of the job. Lots of job ads contain vague descriptions like  201cLead the business and drive change to meet performance goals. 201d Say what?  201cThose phrases don 2019t mean anything to anyone, 201d notes Browne.  201cTry spelling out specifically why the role matters, what they 2019ll be doing, and what they 2019ll learn. 201d LinkedIn 2019s survey of passive job candidates showed that people who already have jobs are most likely to move if a new job offers a candidate the chance to make their own distinctive mark. If that 2019s the case with the job openings you 2019re trying to fill, make it clear.  Be concise. The LinkedIn talent study showed there 2019s a 30% chance your ideal candidate will read your job description on a mobile device, where the smaller screen means each word has to count. You could also consider adding another dimension to the text by embedding a video that shows, say, some of your team 2019s work, or features you talking about the team, the company, and the job.  In a way, the fact that there aren 2019t any old job descriptions around for you to use is an advantage, because it means you get to start fresh. For most hiring managers,  201cit takes a shift in mindset 201d to get away from the same old snooze-inducing job descriptions, says Browne.  201cBut, in the current tight market for talent, it 2019s worth the effort to differentiate your company from the crowd. 201d  Have a career question for Anne Fisher?

            "input": "text:FORTUNE  2014 The news this week that ESPN would be cutting 300 to 400 jobs reverberated across the media landscape. The sports network giant is one of the last remaining examples in the industry of all-out success and profitability. Even as newsrooms have shrunk and publications have folded, ESPN has hired, hired, and kept hiring for years. Et tu, oh Worldwide Leader in Sports?  The fact that ESPN would announce layoffs now was all the more shocking given that its corporate parent, the Walt Disney Co., No. 66 on the Fortune 500 this year with $42.3 billion in revenues, is in such healthy financial shape. Disney DIS made $5.68 billion in profits in 2012, good for the 32nd-largest profit total in the 500. The company 2019s stock has risen 48% over the past 12 months vs. 25% for the S&P 500 SPX .  The sports network, for its part, isn 2019t talking much. It released a statement to the effect that it is narrowing costs in order to sustain growth:  201cWe are implementing changes across the company to enhance our continued growth while smartly managing costs  2026 It will make us more competitive, innovative, and productive. 201d  One former employee that spoke to Fortune says,  201cEverybody gets pissed off because they look at the big Disney figure. I remember hearing a few years back a lot of people saying,  2018Wait, the company made X billion dollars last year and they 2019re cutting my salary, or they 2019re implementing a [hiring] freeze, how could that be? 2019 201d  But, if anything, what is surprising is that ESPN was able to go until now without significant layoffs. The company has experienced hiring freezes, but it had not cut its workforce since 2009, when it laid off more than 100 people in its Bristol, Conn., headquarters office. The sports broadcaster basically sailed through a period when U.S. unemployment hit as high as 10%.  MORE: The definitive sign GM is firing on all cylinders  In recent years ESPN has emerged as the biggest profit driver inside Disney. That kept it immune, to some extent, from tight scrutiny. But Disney has been working for some time to bring greater operational discipline to bear on its various divisions, and the process is finally catching up with ESPN. While 300 to 400 jobs is certainly significant, that size layoff represents a relatively small portion, about 5%, of ESPN 2019s nearly 7,000 full-time employees overall  2014 about 4,000 of whom are in Bristol  2014 and a fraction of Disney 2019s 150,000.  After years of expansion, ESPN, it seems, was carrying baggage it could stand to drop. One former staffer who spoke to Fortune confirms this.  201cThere were a lot of times where you 2019d have three people who were all sharing probably two jobs, 201d says the former employee.  201cThat happened all around the building. There are people there from the  201880s and early  201890s, and they 2019re starting to back up. For a while, ESPN was the only place that was growing. At some point, you run out of places for people to get promoted into. 201d  The cuts, first reported by Deadspin, are being made across the board, but began with people in sales and technology. Sources within ESPN tell Fortune that more are coming. And not just at its Bristol, Conn., headquarters: nearly 20 staffers from the affiliate marketing office in Denver were among those given the pink slip on Tuesday. That office has been shut down because, as a current ESPN employee tells Fortune, it opened way back in 1981 when the cable industry was centered in Denver; over time that changed.  ESPN will also be shutting down Unite, a 60-minute show that premiered in August on ESPNU; ESPN 2019s apparent hope for the show was to enter the social media space in a louder way and get access to younger male viewers. Similarly, Playbook, an offbeat section of espn.com meant for coverage of non-core sports, is closing down.   201cIt sounds like they 2019re doing it over the next month, 201d says one of Fortune 2019s sources of the rest of the job cuts,  201cand that the production people are next.

Their new mission is preventing violent crime; they are part of an anti-urban crime program drafted by former Attorney General Degnan and adopted by Governor Byrne. The plan calls for placing ''metro task forces'' of state police in Newark, Jersey City, Paterson, Camden and other cities. But so far only Trenton has cooperated with this worthy experiment. Some city leaders seem to feel as threatened by this use of troopers as by crime.  Mayor Arthur Holland of Trenton says he'd prefer the aid in cash, to augment his own police department. But he knows that new money is harder to find than troopers and so accepted them. Other municipal leaders are resisting. As expected, local police object that the troopers will undermine their authority and their requests to hire more regular police.  Surprisingly, despite his city's rise in violent crime, even Newark's Mayor Kenneth Gibson has rejected the state's offer. Mr. Gibson, an announced candidate for governor, says the special patrols are just a political show for Mr. Degnan, who resigned his post this week and is expected to join the crowded primary race. Crime, though serious, can be handled well enough locally, the Mayor insists.  It is a politicized year. Yet it would be to his city's benefit if Mayor Gibson could somehow accept the offer. The state has tried to de-politicize it. Both the Attorney General and Clinton Pagano, the state police superintendent, gave local officials and police several months to help decide how and where the troopers would be deployed. And a statewide council of police officials has been established to advise the Attorney General on such questions as crime patrols, training for local police and efforts to upgrade police standards.  The truth is that Newark's citizens and business leaders, like those in other troubled New Jersey cities, would probably welcome the troopers. A plan to revitalize the downtown shopping area would be greatly aided by added security. And if Mr. Degnan collects some praise for the project, so what? One would think that accepting help from the state and distributing it locally could be made to seem as worthy - and politically shrewd - as providing it.

Miss Love, at a news conference in Oakland tonight, said she had not decided whether to accept the job.  The Chicago school board made the offer today after three candidates for the post, including the leading contender, Dr. Frederick D. Holliday, bowed out of consideration over the weekend.  A few weeks ago, before the school board could even make an official offer of the job to its first choice, Arthur Jefferson, superintendent of schools in Detroit, he held a news conference to say that he was not interested.  Dr. Holliday, superintendent of schools in York, Pa., and the board's second choice, withdrew his name from consideration yesterday. He said that Earl Kline, the man who would have replaced him a York's school superintendent, died on Saturday and that under those circumstances he could not leave the school system.  Vincent E. Reed, the former superintendent of schools for Washington and Thomas K. Minter, an Assistant Secretary of Education, also asked that they no longer be considered.  The withdrawal of the three narrowed to field to two candidates, Dr. Love and Dr. Manford Byrd Jr., a deputy superintendent who has been with the Chicago school system for 26 years. Both are black.  After meeting today to decide what to do in light of the withdrawal of the three candidates, the school board voted to approach Dr. Love informally to see if she would accept the post, if it were offered.  The Rev. Kenneth Smith, the school board president, said that Dr. Love had been offered the job because the board ''wanted to bring to a close the search committee efforts.'' Summary: Dr. Ruth B.

Several thousand Honolulu residents joined members of the Pearl Harbor Survivors Association in the main public ceremony at 7:30 this morning in the Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, where war dead are buried in an extinct volcanic crater, known as the Punchbowl, overlooking the modern city of Honolulu. The service was held under sunny skies that later turned to clouds and rain.  Former sailors, soldiers, marines and airmen who were on the scene 40 years ago, now gray-haired men in their 60's and 70's, came from all parts of the United States to participate in the traditional laying of wreaths and the minute of silence at 7:55 A.M., the precise time when the vanguard of more than 350 Japanese planes, off six aircraft carriers, streaked over the island of Oahu and dropped the first bombs. New Political Horizon  The veterans found a Hawaii much different from the islands they knew as servicemen. Now the 50th state, it is a prime tourist attraction whose political horizon is dominated by Americans of Japanese ancestry.  More than 2,400 Americans were killed, 18 naval ships were sunk or damaged and 321 American planes were destroyed or disabled in the sneak assault on the day that President Roosevelt, in his speech the next day calling for a declaration of war, termed ''a date which will live in infamy.''  Maj. Gen. Frank J. Schober, commander of the California State National Guard, summed up the emotions and memories of the survivors at the Punchbowl rite today.  ''All of us are surely silenced as we are proud to be at this holy shrine'' to the war that he said thrust upon the United States ''its present role as leader of the free world.'' Sailors From the Arizona  Six sailors who were aboard the battleship Arizona when she was sunk by bombs and aerial torpedoes placed a wreath on the memorial built over the vessel, which is visible under the clear waters of Pearl Harbor. More than 1,000 sailors - the exact number is unknown - were left entombed in the ship because of the lethal gases that prevented removal of the bodies. After 40 years, the ship is still leaking oil.  Other ceremonies during the day at various sites that figured in the attack were sponsored by 29 military and civilian organizations. Marks left by the bombing were still visible on the buildings at Hickam Field, the Air Force base next to the Navy yard about eight miles from the city.  The returned veterans remembered Hawaii as a semicolonial outpost, mostly sugar cane, pineapple fields and palm trees, whose largest city was a poky little tropical seaport called Honolulu, a name that many mispronounced. On Waikiki's Beach  Waikiki, the beach area where wartime servicemen came to swim in their free time, was then all small residential cottages, each with a tiny lawn, palm trees and tropical flowers around it. There were only two major hotels, the seven-story, white-framed Moana and the pink stucco Royal Hawaiian, about the same height, next to it.  But as the 50th state, a status gained in 1959, Hawaii is a far different place. ''I couldn't believe it,'' Walter De Vinck of Carmel, Calif., a sailor aboard the destroyer Blue at Pearl Harbor 40 years ago, said of the vibrant new city with buildings of 30 and 40 stories blotting out the green Koolau Mountains that once were the town's only skyline.  ''They say the Royal Hawaiian hasn't changed,'' his wife, Johanna, said, adding: ''The shops make my eyes stick out like Ping-Pong balls.''  The Royal Hawaiian and the Moana are dwarfed by newer hotels like the 31-story Sheraton-Waikiki, the reunion headquarters of the Pearl Harbor Survivors Association. Some of the veterans thought it ironic that all three hotels, and a dozen others along the beachfront, were owned by big Japanese interests. Ex-Sailor From Seattle  Robert Hefner of Seattle, who had been a sailor aboard the destroyer Downs during the attack, looked at the coming and going of numerous Japanese vacationers and honeymooners in the busy lobby of the Sheraton-Waikiki. He said, ''I feel like I'm on the Ginza.''  Less visible to the veterans, most of whom had arrived over the weekend, were the changes in Hawaii's political power structure since the war, represented by the dominant position of citizens of Japanese ancestry. Many of these are also war veterans, like Senator Daniel K. Inouye, who lost an arm in Italy, and Hawaii's other Senator, Spark M. Matsunaga.  Both Senators are Democrats, as are Gov. George Ariyoshi, also of Japanese ancestry, and Hawaii's two Representatives, Daniel K. Akaka, a native Hawaiian, and Cecil Heftel, a Caucasian. Like the rise to leadership of Hawaii's ethnic Japanese, the transfer of power from the Republicans to the Democrats is a change traceable to the new situation in the islands after the raid on Pearl Harbor. Suspicion and Prejudice Summary: About 3,000 survivors of the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor and other defense installations here on Dec.  7,1941, joined Honolulu residents today in solemn ceremonies marking the 40th anniversary of the devastating air raid that plunged the United States into World War II.

            "input": "text:PEKING By JAMES P. STERBA  PEKING - When Alexander M. Haig Jr. last came to China in early 1972 to prepare for President Richard M. Nixon's dramatic visit, Peking was not bottling Coca-Cola, Fujian Province was not making Camel cigarettes and Chinese movie studios were not using Kodak film. They are now. Direct trade between China and the United States will probably exceed $6 billion this year. Joint business ventures are encouraged, thousands of students and scholars have been exchanged, United States oil firms are preparing to bid on exploration tracts in the South China Sea and, as Mr. Haig prepared for his expected arrival today in Peking for a three-day visit, the two Governments had been talking for some time about ''mutual security interests.''  It has been nine years since the Chinese-American breakthrough at Shanghai and 2 1 2 years since Washington broke official relations with the Republic of China on Taiwan and established normal diplomatic relations with the mainland Government. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in late 1979 helped draw Washington and Peking still closer.  But it has also been about one year since Ronald Reagan, in the words of the official Chinese News Agency Xinhua, ''insulted one billion Chinese'' by calling for renewed ''official'' ties with Taiwan. At the time, Leonard Woodcock, the American Ambassador to Peking, said the campaign remarks threatened to upset delicate Chinese-American understandings. Since Mr. Reagan's election, it has hung like a dark cloud over the Chinese leadership.  Insults may be throwaway lines in American domestic politics; not so in China. In Peking, they are among the most powerful weapons available to leadership factions attempting to undermine each other's power. Minor mistakes, misstatements and humiliations have the power of electoral votes which are hoarded for use against adversaries in moments of weakness. A Prime Irritant Revived  What made Mr. Reagan's ''insult'' so humiliating and thus so hard to forget was that it resurrected the Taiwan issue at a time when, by most accounts, neither China nor Taiwan wanted it resurrected. In the warm glow of Sino-American normalization, which was portrayed to the mainland Chinese as a great victory for them, Peking could swallow the Taiwan Relations Act in 1979 with sharp but short-lived protests for the record. Even quiet arms sales to Taiwan, provided for in the act, proceeded with relatively minor objections. Critics of Vice Chairman Deng Xiaoping, China's leader, found it hard to snipe at leftover United States-Taiwan irritants in the overwhelming glow of the normalization ''victory.''  But Mr. Reagan's campaign rhetoric helped make Taiwan a prime irritant again in Chinese Communist Party politics. And as the glow of normalization faded into the routine business of deepening official ties between Peking and Washington, the Taiwan Relations Act continued to preoccupy Peking, mostly because the Reagan Administration at first did little to help Mr. Deng ward off the potent notion that he was being made a fool of by the new occupants of the White House.  China's Government-controlled press has leveled more criticism at the Taiwan relations law this month than at any time since the act was passed by Congress in March,1979, as the instrument for governing unofficial United States-Taiwan relations. The criticism continued while Washington was preparing for Secretary of State Haig's visit. The preparations included the announcement that export controls are to be lifted on the sale to Peking of military-related technology, something China has wanted for a long time.  In the past few weeks, senior Chinese Foreign Ministry officials have told visiting delegations that the Reagan Administration is overestimating China's patience about Taiwan and that moves to sell fresh supplies of arms to that island would have ''dangerous consequences.'' Last week, just before Mr. Haig departed for Asia, the Foreign Ministry commented on reports from Washington that the United States wanted to provide Peking with military-related hardware and also to sell new defensive weapons to Taiwan. ''We have time and again made it clear,'' the ministry warned, ''that we would rather receive no U.S. arms than accept continued U.S. interference in our internal affairs by selling arms to Taiwan, to which we can never agree. Should the United States continue to sell arms to Taiwan in disregard of our repeated expressions of resolute objection, we certainly will give a strong response.''  Chinese officials pointed to the response they made earlier this year when the Netherlands Government permitted a Dutch firm to sell two small submarines to Taiwan. Peking recalled its ambassador to The Hague, downgrading official relations to the level of charge d'affaires.  As Mr. Haig's party arrived for a stopover in Hong Kong, Xinhua published a blistering commentary, saying that any American effort to sell arms to both China and Taiwan ''is doomed to failure.'' Perhaps more important, the commentary, written under the pen name, Hau Xiu, by a senior official, said that United States interests in further ''strategic relations'' with China were now regarded as secondary to arms sales to Taiwan ''because this is an issue of principle and China will not barter away principles.''  Mr. Haig commented that he was not in Asia to sell arms to anybody, but to talk about broader issues. Reporters accompanying him were told that the Administration saw no urgency about supplying advanced aircraft to Taiwan. Mr. Haig, they were told, intends to tell the Chinese that the growing Soviet military threat has created ''a strategic imperative'' for them to establish closer ties in all spheres.  Mr. Woodcock, Washington's first Ambassador to China, told a Congressional hearing this month that tensions between China and Taiwan had dropped to their lowest level in 30 years, that Taiwan did not need fresh arms for its defense and that China could not afford to buy and could not absorb much in the way of United States arms. Nevertheless, the arms issue, like the Taiwan issue, has grown in importance, casting a shadow over what has been a brightening relationship between Washington and Peking.

            "input": "text:JERUSALEM, June 21 2014 Israel today rejected the Security Council's condemnation of the bombing attack on an Iraqi nuclear reactor two weeks ago, and chided the United States for approving ''this unjust resolution.''  In a statement read by Prime Minister Menachem Begin, the Cabinet said that the Council action, which came on Friday, ''gave expression to the double standard prevailing in the international body.  ''The Iraqi dictatorship built a reactor in order to prepare secretly, under false pretensions and deceit, atomic bombs to be thrown in time on the centers of the Jewish population in the State of Israel,'' the communique said.  ''For what are they condemning at the Security Council? Not the potential producer of atomic bombs, but the people who prevented, thanks to the heroic action of its sons, the disaster to be suffered by its citizens and children.'' Mild Rebuke for the U.S.  The statement added this relatively mild rebuke of the Reagan Administration: ''In sorrow, we note that the United States, our friend and ally as stated by its Ambassador to the United Nations, gave hand to the grave wrong done to Israel. The United States has even conducted talks with Iraq in order to formulate a resolution agreed beforehand between the two of them.''  Despite the American vote, officials in Jerusalem remained optimistic about the course of American-Israeli relations, stressing President Reagan's acknowledgement at a news conference last week of threats posed to Israel.  ''Reagan gave us the feeling that this vote was pro forma,'' said one official, noting Washington's desire to maintain good relations with the Arabs.  Yehuda Blum, Israel's delegate to the United Nations, even praised the American representative during an interview on Israel Army radio. ''Speaking about Jeane Kirkpatrick,'' he said, ''I think that she can be counted on as far as her friendship to Israel is concerned.'' Standing in Polls Increases  The June 7 attack on the Iraqi reactor appears to have increased Mr. Begin's standing in public opinion polls. A survey of 1,268 adults by the Modiin Ezrahi Applied Research Center from June 15-18 showed Mr. Begin's Likud bloc winning 49 of the 120 seats in Parliament, compared with 46 seats in a similar poll just before the attack.  The results, published today by The Jerusalem Post, showed a drop by the opposition Labor Party from 40 seats just before the reactor strike to 37 just afterward. The percentage of undecided voters rose from 14.5 to 22.8 in the same period.  In a related matter, a Begin official said today that the Prime Minister, in misquoting a Baghdad newspaper to justify the Israeli attack, was the victim of ''poor staff work,'' and that the error was not a deliberate distortion.  At a news conference June 9, Mr. Begin read what turned out to be a nonexistent passage attributed to the Al Thawra newspaper of Oct. 4 saying that the Iraqi reactor was not designed against Iran, which was suspected of having bombed it Sept. 30, but against Israel.  Meanwhile, the Israeli radio reported that the head of Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, had complained to Mr. Begin about excessive publicity about details of the Iraqi reactor. The report asserted that the intelligence chief, whose name is a state secret, was concerned about jeopardizing sources and methods of gathering information. The Prime Minister's office denied the report. Summary: Israel today rejected the Security Council's condemnation of the bombing attack on an Iraqi nuclear reactor two weeks ago, and chided the United States for approving ''this unjust resolution.''

            "input": "text:The metaphoric relationship between dancing and sex is a two-way street, as in  rockin' and rollin'  and the euphemistic  horizontal tango , a term so cheesy it should turn all right-minded people into wallflowers. Latin dancing, in particular, we think of as a public analogue of intercourse. Inevitably The Simpsons has spoofed this idea with a dance called La Penetrada, which promises to make  sex look like church . In literary circles, Eros graces Jane Austen's dances, despite all the juvenile giggling over red breeches and the stubbornness of the leading man. One of the central cinematic examples of dance as erotic affirmation surely belongs to Saturday Night Fever, with John Travolta's exuberant pelvis nodding  Yes, yes, yes!  to all of life's propositions.  But dancing, especially when conducted with precision in dimly lit ballrooms, also has a ghoulish aspect, one that our innate cultural sensors immediately recognise. In fact, if people still dressed as skeletons for Halloween, rather than as someone from a viral internet video or a coquette with a smear of fake blood on her lips, then the parties thrown on 31 October would be less rock'n'roll and more evocative of that old medieval archetype, the danse macabre. This 15th-century scene was typically set in a graveyard and showed the personified figure of Death leading a troupe of the living intermingled with cavorting skeletons. It has since influenced all the major art forms, and from mid-November, London's Wellcome Collection will host an ensemble of pictorial danses macabres as part of its major winter exhibition, Death. The collection is the work of the Chicago-based former antique print dealer Richard Harris, and among this 300-piece tribute to mortality there is a sort of international championship of skeleton-weight dancing.  Emphasising the carefree spirit of the world beyond, the 19th-century Japanese artist Kawanabe Kyosai's Frolicking Skeletons shows a bony whorl of carcasses on a hillside. Walter Sauer's 1925 interpretation, a black-and-white woodblock print, is a more obvious cousin to our contemporary iconography of bats, tombstones, full moon and skulls, and was inspired by both European symbolism and Japanese printmaking. Otto Dix's Dance of Death 1917 is a sarcastic title for his battlefield etching of dismembered soldiers skewered on barbed wire, for there's no music in these splayed corpses. The soldiers are as evocative of a jig as a chalk outline is of a break-dancer. Tellingly absent in Dix's scene is the animating figure of Death. If war's monstrosities make collateral damage of God, then it seems that the Reaper, too, has no place in this evil world of men.  Traditionally the allegorical agenda of the danse macabre is to remind the vainglorious that all of life's roads, from the gold-paved to the potholed, lead to the final, spasmodic chorea of the deathbed. And yet dancing is a complex image through which to illustrate death's egalitarianism, since few places have traditionally shown less sympathy to democracy than the European ballroom. Courtly dances have always been animated by the violence of hierarchy. Silk fans open and close like barber knives, and even the slang of the dance is serrated: when nobles aren't cutting each other with their glances, they're carving happy couples apart by cutting in. It's therefore apposite that later versions of the danse macabre exchanged the graveyard for the aristocrat's party in order to emphasise the immoral decadence of the privileged classes. As an uninvited challenger to this opulence, Death hits the dancefloor bearing the largest and heftiest of the metaphorical blades.  In Edgar Allan Poe's story  The Masque of the Red Death , Prince Prospero holds a grand party in his mansion while around him his serfs are dying of plague. Prospero arrogantly believes that wealth ensures immunity from contagion, until the masked presence of Death gatecrashes the soir 00e9e and  with a slow and solemn movement, as if more fully to sustain its role, stalked to and fro among the waltzers . A visual equivalent to Poe's eerie massacre is Alfred Rethel's Death the Strangler  2013 The First Outbreak of Cholera at a Masked Ball in Paris,1831, which is also part of the Wellcome exhibition. In this wood engraving, Death is the sauciest allegory on the block, manifesting as a skeleton among the fresh corpses of partygoers, wearing something between a monk's hooded habit and a negligee. Jauntily playing the fiddle with a thigh bone, one severely well-turned ankle thrust forward, Death takes over from the band of musicians who are depicted fleeing in horror. Here Death targets the upper classes, and, as in Poe's tale, the music's tempo seems to catalyse the infection, making it an instant killer.  The great literary modernists used the danse macabre more subtly, rarefying it into a sort of dreadful fume, a felt but unspoken atmosphere that gave pallid overtones to otherwise convivial scenes. Modernism was in many ways a morbid enterprise, with keen instincts for investing the festive with the funereal. The relatively new invention of the X-ray  2013 science's realisation of memento mori  2013 offered a cutting-edge metaphor through which to explore our mortal fears. There's no shortage of sinister balls in Marcel Proust's In Search of Lost Time, and at one of them an X-ray image becomes a party-piece, eliciting one man's grave denial  at the sight of this rosary of bones labelled as being a picture of himself . Arguably this heightened awareness of what lies beneath prompts another of Proust's characters to compare an elderly guest to  a skeleton in an open dress .  Proust diffuses the heavy-handed allegorising of Poe and Rethel by working with the same ideas at the level of metaphor. His most chilling partygoer is a doctor by the name of Professor E, described as wandering around the gathering alone,  like a minister of death . But Proust also understood aristocratic vanity, and how the complex rituals of French social life were designed to suppress the possibility of death, just as Prince Prospero believes his palace gates will keep out the plague. In one of Proust's darkest and funniest party scenes, the dying Charles Swann tries to broach the subject of his impending demise with his hosts, the Duke and Duchess of Guermantes. Swann accepts their wilful evasion of his announcement, knowing  that for other people their own social obligations took precedence over the death of a friend . While his wife disappears to change her shoes, the Duke talks helplessly to Swann in morbid colloquialisms, displaying a Freudian compulsion that would make Basil Fawlty cringe. He tells poor Swann how his wife is  tired out already, she'll reach the dinner-table quite dead. Besides, I tell you frankly, I'm dying of hunger.   Virginia Woolf, an admiring reader of Proust, was interested in the dramatic potential of the party as a way of bringing to the fore that which the joviality of the occasion attempts to deny. In Mrs Dalloway's climactic gathering she describes one guest as a  spectral grenadier, draped in black . Death arrives here, too, not as a shrouded figure but in the form of gossip: a shell-shocked soldier, a patient of one of her affluent acquaintances, has that very evening flung himself from his window.  Oh! thought Clarissa, in the middle of my party, here's death.  The soldier's suicide is a textbook memento mori for Mrs Dalloway, who has been rendered blas 00e9 to the terror and beauty of living by the self-absorbed anxieties of social life. One of the cruellest moments in Stephen Daldry's film The Hours, based on Michael Cunningham's Woolf-inspired novel of the same name, occurs when a terminally ill character tells his friend and carer:  Oh Mrs Dalloway, always giving parties to cover the silence.   The Christmas party in James Joyce's  The Dead  is another attempt at the suppression of existential silence, and is perhaps the most concerted modernist interpretation of the danse macabre. The floors of the house creak and thump with waltzes and quadrilles, but this liveliness summons ghosts. Gabriel Conroy's wife Gretta stands on the stairs, transfixed by a song that reminds her of a dead love from her youth. After Gretta tells Gabriel about this memory, Gabriel becomes conscious of the decay he has felt all along. In his nervous speech at the party he describes his old aunt as being  gifted with perennial youth . However, once cuckolded by his wife's reminiscences, he thinks how this same aunt  would soon be a shade  2026 He had caught that haggard look upon her face for a moment when she was singing.   On a wall above the piano, Gabriel notices a picture of Romeo and Juliet's balcony scene hanging beside a needlework depiction of Edward IV's sons, presumed murdered in the Tower of London. Desire and death rub shoulders here, by now a familiar partnership in our post-Freud world. Richard Harris's collection reflects the dynamic between eroticism and annihilation in pieces such as Ivo Saliger's The Doctor, the Girl, and Death. In this muted etching on brown paper, a brawny doctor holds up a slumping, naked girl, his free hand jealously pushing against the skull of the crouching skeleton that grasps the girl's thighs and paws at her hair. A piece entitled  Au Revoir  is a French postcard displaying a black-and-white sketch of two lovers on the cusp of a kiss, their dark bouffant heads of hair doubling as the cavernous eyes of the skull into which their clinch is set. A photograph by the Czech photographer Franti 0161ek Drtikol, who often used professional dancers as his subjects, shows a female nude holding a skull. The erotic vitality of the model's strong, naked physique contrasts with her sobering prop, but the meaning of the image is made ambiguous by the careful balance of its symbolism: does the dwarfed skull's empty gaze wither the nude's fecundity, or do life's largeness and vigour ultimately overwhelm the smallness of death?  The Freudian notion that pleasure and destruction are our two principal motivations continues to fuel the potency of dancing as an ambiguous symbol long after its macabre medieval career. After the modernists, Eros and Death continue their waltz in Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa's The Leopard, a novel that is clearly alert to the decay woven into youthful romance. At yet another deathly ball, men wearing black are likened to carrion crows; the women are wrapped in dresses from Naples, sent to them  in long black cases like coffins . The party's beautiful young couple, Tancredi and Angelica, remind the Sicilian prince, Don Fabrizio, of actors playing Romeo and Juliet (them again) who are unaware of where the script will lead them. Melancholy with middle age, the prince watches them blithely sailing over the dance floor, sensing both their tenderness and self-interest, and how these complexities of love are in the end trumped by the unspoken fear of death,  by the mutual clasp of those bodies destined to die . Here Don Fabrizio is sick with the nostalgia portrayed in Alexander Pope's  Epistle to a Lady , which dramatises lost beauty as a sort of hag's jig:  Still round and round the Ghosts of Beauty glide,   And haunt the places where their Honour dy'd.   There is ironic power in coupling the vivacity of dance with the tomb's stillness. At their best, the artistic progeny of the danse macabre occupy that affecting region between archetype and clich 00e9, allowing the artist access to themes of hubris, decadence, ephemerality and sorrow. Dance being a temporal medium gives it a natural kinship with the idea of mortality. In Joyce's story, Miss Daly's waltz  made lovely time  but, while time may be many things, lovely isn't one of them. The waltz's three-quarter pulse produces a temporal circularity that attempts to defy life's linear diminishing.  Dance's temporal evasions and manipulations serve only to make the ineluctability of time more apparent, and it's arguably this curious inversion that has attracted the artistic imagination. It is harder to sense the frantic denial beating within free-style dancing's sheer exhilaration. But even young, rhythmic Tony in Saturday Night Fever feels the acceleration of all this exhilaration, as though disco, being life in fast-forward, is its own groovy kind of memento mori.  Dancing can't last for ever,  Tony says.  It's a short-lived kind of thing  2026 I'm getting older, you know?  Summary: From the cavorting skeletons of medieval danse macabre to Saturday Night Fever, the terror of mortality has always mingled with joie de vivre on the dancefloor. By Laurence Scott",

On top of that, a tipped employee's minimum wage in Seattle is set at $10 hour, compared to $11 for everyone else. While this helps employers meet the new costs, it's likely to turn out to be a triple whammy for the waiters and waitresses who rely on tips:  More taxable income. The current federal minimum wage for tipped workers is just $2.13 hour. In Seattle, the minimum wage for tipped workers even before this  increase  was much more than that, but it was still less than $10 hour. Either way, that first $10 in tips for workers will now become part of a more reportable and taxable income when it used to be a cash-in-pocket payment.  Lower tips. The dining public in Seattle is well aware of the minimum-wage hikes and is seeing this as a  raise  in tipped workers' pay as opposed to a de facto reduction in their income. Many restaurant workers are already reporting reductions in tips as customers take all of this into account.  Math. Employers now have a massive new burden of calculating volatile tip income for each worker and keeping very accurate records and making those gap payments when workers don't reach the $10 hour threshold.  Simply put, this makes it harder for even honest employers to pay their tipped workers accurately and in a timely fashion. And anyone who knows how the real world works knows that when you make it harder to do something, it often doesn't get done. This is not just a hypothetical scenario. All of the major labor activist groups across the country have long argued that tipped workers are more likely to be illegally underpaid. When business is down, they argue, there's a huge incentive for employers not to make up the wage difference for their employees. There are hundreds of documented cases of businesses doing just that.  Read MoreGwyneth Paltrow fails $29 food-stamp challenge  Meanwhile, that failed  we're from the government and we're here to help  reality in Seattle is now in danger of spreading to the much larger city of Los Angeles. L.A.'s restaurant owners are pushing hard for a similar tipped-income offset to the newly proposed $13.25 to $15.25 minimum wage the L.A. city council is currently considering. And the restaurant owners may win this fight because L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti is already on record supporting a California state assembly bill that would count tips toward meeting minimum pay requirements. In other words, the push to supposedly raise minimum pay in Los Angeles has a great chance of bringing down a long-standing California law that made working as a tipped employee much more lucrative.  And it's really a bad thing to mess with tipping, because tipping is one of the few remaining ways the customer and the actual person providing a service can relate to one another in a truly free market sense. It's empowering for everyone involved in the transaction. I may not have any control over what my waiter's minimum pay from his employer is, but tipping gives me the power to be the primary source of my waiter's income during the time he's serving me and my family.  Read MoreWant $70000 in minimum wages?  The waiter may not be able to improve his base salary more than once or twice a year no matter how well he works. But every time he serves a customer he has an excellent chance of being rewarded more financially for making an extra effort. It's an unwritten contract between the two of us that more often than not results in me getting very good service and the waiter getting a financial boost for doing so. It's a terrible thing to reduce the financial effectiveness of tips because of rules imposed by an outside party who is not the customer, the service provider, or even that service provider's employer. In this case, that outside party is the government.  Maybe we should make our elected leaders work only for tips from the real voters.

It's true that a small number of big cap-names are doing well in 2014:  Bank of America up 5.4 percent;  Goldman Sachs up 0.5 percent;  Morgan Stanley up 0.5 percent;  JP Morgan up 0.3 percent;  Some of this is clearly based on expectations of a steeper yield curve, and perhaps on more mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and leveraged buyout activity. Still, financial sector names had a good year, and much of this is already anticipated.  But it's a small group. Only 22 of the 81 stocks in the financial sector are positive. Most insurance companies are down, as are most regional banks. Outside of the large-caps above, there's a smattering of REITs in the green:  Boston Properties up 1.2 percent;  Simon Property Group up 1.2 percent;  Equity Residential up 1.1 percent;  Kimco Realty up 1.0 percent;  What do they have in common? They are the biggest companies in the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) space. In fact, they are 7 of the 10 largest REITs by market capitalization that is in the Vanguard REIT Index Fund.

But one trader says Twitter will make a full comeback by 2017.   In the short term, there's nothing really saying Twitter can reverse and go higher,  Andrew Keene of KeeneOnTheMarket.com said Monday on CNBC's  Trading Nation.   However, I think it's a great longer-term play.   The social media firm's first-quarter earnings report prompted a sharp drop of 18 percent in the company's share price. More recently, Twitter reported earnings that beat expectations in July, but the stock fell more than 14 percent on disappointing active-user numbers. The stock is down more than 18 percent year-to-date.  Without naming a specific catalyst for Monday's selloff, analyst Ronald Josey of JMP Securities said the stock's overall weakness is due to continued concerns over the company's growth, product launches and search for a new chief executive.  Read More Twitter closes at record low amid growth concerns  But Keene said the social media firm still has a lot of potential with its user base of 316 million monthly active users. He said the company will rebound once it fixes its monetization problems, or it could be a potential buyout target.   I think it will reverse and over time, I'm not talking about the next day, in the next week even, but I think it can recuperate to about the $45 dollar level,  Keene said.  For his trade, Keene is buying the January 2017 35-strike call option and selling the 45-strike call option for $2.50. Keene's price target is $45 by January 2017, and his trade is profitable if Twitter rises above $37.50 by that time.   I can be initially wrong because the price action and price momentum is to the downside on the daily and weekly chart,  Keene said.  For now, analysts aren't too positive on Twitter's outlook. Out of 40 analysts that cover the stock, 63 percent have a  hold  rating, with an average target price of about $40, according to FactSet.

A Stifel report from last week also expressed concern about dwindling users.

Whether verbally fencing with his department chair or ex-wife, or giving a hilariously inappropriate presentation to academic peers, Davis seems to be always performing. It 2019s a tap dance of wit, emotional evasion, and sloppy charm, and an act that has served him reasonably well in the past. But for all his face-saving bluster he 2019s reached middle age with only a contract-to-contract position as adjunct faculty, an unpublished book, and an unproduced screenplay to show for it.  As written by playwright Andrew Clarke  2014 who, yes, teaches playwriting at Emerson College  2014 Davis could come off as a preening boor. So it 2019s a tribute to Mathers 2019s lively performance that we understand his charm, and believe that he could have safely ridden his wave of bad behavior for a while, even if headed merely toward professional (and personal) mediocrity. Mathers is laugh-out-loud hilarious in a monologue that best showcases Davis 2019s disdainful hamminess.  Much of  201cAcademy Fight Song 201d feels very familiar. Characters like Davis pretty much occupy their own subgenre in literature and film. (Do I even have to mention that he has too much fondness for brown liquor, and a roving eye pointed toward graduate students?) As such, little about the play feels particularly urgent. But Clarke 2019s dialogue is so smart and funny  2014 and the four-person cast does so well with it  2014 that the play sustains itself over its 80-minute run time, and offers a convincing portrait of a man and his chronic self-sabotage.  What professional promise Davis once possessed is now exhibited more promisingly in Jonathan (Tyler Catanella), the whiz-kid prot 00e9g 00e9 turned competitor. He 2019s a former student who for mysterious reasons has become, in his mid-20s, an in-demand scholar and writer.  201cYou 2019re getting the life I trained for, 201d Davis says at one point, and it 2019s as much an objective observation as a cry of distress.  Jonathan is working on what seems to be a text-heavy graphic novel, and the play turns on the notion that he can stoke a bidding war among publishers in part by affecting  201cthe whole Salinger act 201d and disappearing from an obscure academic conference. Catanella is called upon to perform a huge personality shift between his two scenes, and while he 2019s convincing in both modes, Jonathan ends up feeling like two different people.  In fact, all the plot machinations, and the verbally circuitous ways in which they 2019re set up and then explained  2014 Davis 2019s drinking buddy and boss Greer (Richard Snee) talks at length about an offstage character who Clarke probably should have just saved for a different play  2014 are the least convincing elements of the piece. Since they are there only to put Davis in a moment of crisis so we can see him respond to it, they should be less cumbersome in the flow of things.  Clarke has loaded the play with very funny lines, and director Joe Antoun keeps things moving, particularly in a scene between Davis and ex-wife Liz (Tracy Oliverio) that reveals their relationship as one of the more interesting aspects of the play. ( 201cI didn 2019t enjoy myself nearly as much as you suspected, 201d he says by way of lame excuse for a past extramarital dalliance.)

Google 2019s previous attempts at creating a rival social network to compete with Twitter or Facebook have been unsuccessful so far. The company shut down its social network Orkut in 2014, and social and work communications tool Wave was also shuttered in 2010 2014only a year after its launch. Google+ was the search giant 2019s next big bet on social, but unfortunately Google+ didn 2019t take off either.  Get Data Sheet, Fortune 2019s technology newsletter.  With Spaces, Google is trying its hand at social conversations specifically for groups. Within the app, users can find and share articles, videos, and images without leaving the app as Google Search, YouTube, and Chrome are built into the app itself. Basically, you don 2019t have to leave the app to find a link or video to share because search tools for YouTube and Google 2019s general search engine are baked into the app. Users can also search their own Spaces (or conversations) by keyword to find past conversations.  Google said that you can invite friends to participate in conversations by messaging them or via email. Users could also initiate conversations with groups through Google 2019s chat and video messaging app, Hangouts.  For more on Google, watch:  It also appears the app is designed to be used broadly 2014not just for work communications. Google has suggested some examples of how users could use Spaces for everyday life events, ranging from planning a trip to just sharing an news article with friends.  Spaces, available for Android and iOS, is coming soon, but it is not yet in the Google Play store or Apple App Store yet. Summary: It's not just for workplace communications, either.",

            "input": "text:Do you think presidential candidates know what it sounds like to be on the other side of them? I am not sure. Do I even know what my voice sounds like? Do you?  Self-awareness is a competitive advantage. The problem with presidential elections is that every candidate is hamstrung by a bevy of handlers who analyze every word, nod, action, and response. Thus, candidates can come across as very disingenuous and even scripted. Maybe that is why Donald Trump has been such a big hit 2013he apparently tells it like it is.  And yet, in the end, the American voter is going to vote for an individual who displays two very important ideals: intent and vision. The success of how each candidate reveals these will directly affect their success or demise.  Consider this. If you have a boss who is against you, but is acting as if they are for you, can you read between the lines? Usually. In the same way, if this boss was for you, could you feel it? Would you know they were supporting you? Most likely yes, right?  In my history of working with leaders around the globe, I have found very few leaders who are against others, and very few who are for others. Most leaders are simply for themselves, focused on their preservation and success.  That is intent  2013 or rather the response to intent, the feeling that someone is either for you, against you, or for themselves.  And so, we ask the first question: Who are the presidential candidates for? Is Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump for us, against us, or for themselves? How about Bernie Sanders, or Marco Rubio, or Ted Cruz?  When you listen and observe each candidate, what words are they using and how does it feel to be on the other side of that person?  Intent is the true power test. You can just sense it. Now, don 2019t get me wrong, every candidate wants to win and some candidates are natural politicians. Yet, it is possible to get a sense of the real motive when spending time with leaders or observing them.  The presidential candidate who proves to the American public that they are for the American public will increase their chances of winning exponentially.  Some candidates have a hard time connecting because of their personality type. Introverts have a much more difficult time connecting with the public, and America is an extremely extroverted culture. (Could that be why some of the earlier candidates have had less staying power?) Proper intent, however, can be felt; the more authentic the person, the more success each person tends to have on the campaign trail.  The second ideal is the ability to communicate a compelling vision of where they want to go. This has been hard for Jeb Bush as many people see him as part of the past instead of the future, which led to his backing out of the race. The same is true for Hillary Clinton. So far in this presidential campaign, the outsider has benefitted much more than the insider.  My prediction is that the winner of the 2016 presidential election will be the person who conveys the clearest and most compelling vision to the American people.  One insight into this reality comes from Clotaire Rapaille, the author of the The Culture Code, a book about understanding people 2019s motivations in particular cultures. He writes that the code word for America is  2018dream, 2019 and the code word for the American president is  2018Moses. 2019 The candidate who is the most Moses-like and who most conveys a vision to take the American people to the promised land wins.  That 2019s an intriguing fact, that the most compelling visionary candidate has one over the other candidates. There is no better example than President Obama. He was the most Moses-like candidate in our recent history, as his  201cYes We Can 201d campaign compelled hundreds of thousands to vote for him across party lines.  A major issue in this election is the cynicism from past politicians from both sides who have used words to motivate, opening the door to outsiders to have a stronger position than ever in the past few elections. And yet, words must match actions in this election cycle. Intent must connect with vision. That is why the words are even more bold  2013 to make an impact where the normal political words won 2019t.  Intent and vision are the keys to this year 2019s election success. The most authentic, Moses-like character will win. Those who feel like a politician and preserve themselves with a relentless inward focus will lose the very things they are afraid of losing.  Consider your review of each candidate based on their intent  2013 are they for you, against you, or for themselves? Judge also on their vision for the future. Is their vision compelling, just a power play, or politics as usual? It is the candidates 2019 job to put themselves forward to be judged worthy. It is our job, as the voters, to vote on their intent and vision.  Jeremie Kubicek is the co-author of 5 Voices: How to Communicate Effectively with Everyone You Lead (Wiley 2016), by Jeremie Kubicek and Steve Cockram, about knowing what it sounds like to be on the other side of you.

That could change in the next few years as the telco upgrades its wireless networks to the next-generation technology known as 5G, Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam said on Tuesday.  About half the total cost of installing FiOS now is spent putting wires and equipment in a new customer 2019s home, he explained. But once the extreme high speeds of 5G wireless are online, those wired connections wouldn 2019t be necessary anymore.  In tests at a Verizon facility, 5G has reached two-gigabyte per second speeds 2014about 50 times the rate of fast 4G wireless connections today. Instead of tuning wires into a home, Verizon could just give the customer an inexpensive wireless router to connect to the 5G network with enough capacity to receive Internet and TV service.  Get Data Sheet, Fortune 2019s technology newsletter.  When asked if FiOS like services could be offered nationwide with 5G, McAdam was enthusiastic.  201cI don 2019t know why there would be any limitation on where we would take it, 201d he replied, speaking at the J.P. Morgan Global Technology, Media, and Telecom Conference in Boston.  201cThere 2019s no reason you need to be limited. 201d  Lawmakers and regulators have been trying to encourage traditional telephone and cable providers to compete more for the past few decades, but with limited success. Verizon 2019s FiOS provides direct competition to cable within the company 2019s limited, original service area. Yet Verizon has mostly scaled back expansion plans and sold off customers in three states last year.  Then last month, Verizon agreed to bring FiOS service to the city of Boston. The slow, six-year roll out will rely on 5G wireless, particularly for video services, however.  Verizon vz has expanded into owning some of the video content its customers watch, buying Intel 2019s intc On Cue product and then spending $4.4 billion for AOL. It is also on the running to buy Yahoo yhoo .  McAdam declined to discuss the latest with the Yahoo bid, but he did try to tamp down speculation that Verizon might go after even bigger producers, like a major Hollywood studio or cable network group.   201cWe 2019re not doing that, I don 2019t think we need to do that, 201d he responded when asked about a major content acquisition. Noting the telecom carrier prefers to partner with traditional content producers like Hearst and Dreamworks, McAdam admitted,  201cIt 2019s not exactly our strong suit. 201d  McAdam also repeated what Verizon CFO Fran Shammo said last week about the impact of the walk out by some 40,000 workers. Replacement workers have not completed as many installations of Verizon 2019s FiOS service in the second quarter as the now-striking regular workers did in the first quarter, McAdam said.   201cWe have pushed off installations, 201d McAdam said.  201cWe 2019re doing a lot of installations but we 2019re not doing the same volume that we had before. So we won 2019t be driving similar numbers in second quarter that we would in first from an installation perspective. 201d Summary: New wireless tech could cut costs and let FiOS go nationwide.",

            "input": "text:A cacophony of squeaks, clicks and whistles erupts from the frigid waters of Cunningham Inlet in the Canadian Arctic. Though reminiscent of squeaky bath toys, these squeakers are very much alive. Swimming at the surface are hundreds of icy-white beluga whale mothers, their small grey calves hugging their sides.  Nicknamed  canaries of the sea  by early whalers, belugas' squeaks and squawks are critical to their survival. It's their main form of communication, as they live in a habitat that is nearly pitch-black for half of every year.  They are navigating under ice, in dark waters, so they are completely reliant on sound,  says Valeria Vergara of the Vancouver Aquarium in British Columbia.  Their communication system is startlingly complex, and scientists like Vergara are beginning to unravel how it works. They can now eavesdrop on the belugas, revealing clues to what they are saying. But looming over all this is the threat posed by noisy humans, with our ships and the banging air guns we use to search for oil and gas. The question now is, will the belugas still be able to talk to each other when their homes are drowned in man-made sound?  Among whales, belugas are one of the most vocal. A group of belugas makes a noise a bit like a crowd of children shouting in the distance.  If you get close enough to hear individual calls, you will realise that they make a variety of strange sounds. Beluga calls variously resemble a cork being prized from a bottle or a creaking door, along with sounds described as clicks, squeaks, chirps, bleats, moans, groans, and whistles. In 2012, scientists reported that a captive beluga had learned to make what sounded like garbled human speech, presumably in an attempt to mimic its human neighbours.  Belugas can wiggle their melon  It's not just about communication: belugas also used sound for navigation.  Sound to them is like eyes to us,  says Vergara. Like other toothed whales and many bats, they use echolocation: they make a rapid string of clicks that bounce back from the environment, and interpret the echoes to identify objects such as food.  Belugas make all these sounds despite having no vocal cords. Instead they  speak  through nasal sacs near their blowhole. In essence, they talk through their noses.  They can also carefully direct their sounds, using a fatty deposit called a melon located between a beluga's blowhole and snout, on its  forehead . Unusually, belugas can wiggle their melon  2013 yes, really  2013 and this may help them fire sounds in specific directions.  To find out how beluga communication works, Vergara spent five weeks in the summer of 2014 in a leaky yurt perched on the edge of a cliff next to Cunningham Inlet. About 2000 beluga mothers and calves spend their summers there each year. Vergara found that they form kindergarten groups, with 10 to 15 young calves playing and socialising under the care of a few watchful adults. They all talk non-stop.  The youngsters must learn from their elders  It is not just the mothers that take care of the calves. They get lots of help from  allomothers ; a community of sisters, cousins, aunts, and grandmothers. Many of these females start producing milk when another female's new baby is born, even if they themselves have no nursing infant. So baby belugas have a veritable buffet of milk at their disposal.  Vergara's work suggests that baby belugas may learn to call in the same way human babies do.  Baby belugas are not born knowing this beluga repertoire of sounds, just as we're not born knowing how to speak,  says Vergara. The youngsters must learn from their elders.  What's more, it seems they learn in a similar way to human babies.  Vergara started by focusing on captive animals at the Vancouver Aquarium before testing her findings in the wild. Her research revealed that belugas make barely audible sounds within an hour of being born. The babies start making simple whistles within a few weeks.  It takes babies one to two years to develop perfect renditions of the contact calls  But as well as whistling, Vergara discovered that mothers and babies also use another kind of call, from soon after birth. It sounds a bit like running a finger rapidly along a plastic comb, and Vergara thinks it is a way of keeping in contact. In effect, mothers are saying  hello, I'm here, where are you?  and their babies are replying,  I'm here, I'm here  or  Mommy, come over .  Baby beluga vocal repertoire starts out simple and becomes more complex and varied over time. It takes babies one to two years to develop perfect renditions of the contact calls, Vergara has discovered.  In this, young belugas are similar to human babies, who babble and make rudimentary attempts at word segments before being able to fully form words, and then sentences.   Cunningham Inlet is one of the most pristine beluga watching areas in the world,  says Vergara. As a result its belugas appear to be holding their own. But elsewhere numbers are dwindling.  Scientists now suspect that noise is one of the factors contributing to their decline  Away to the south in Cook Inlet, Alaska, belugas head in from the Pacific to feast on salmon that swim up its rivers during the summer. A survey in the 1970s estimated there were about 1300 belugas in Cook Inlet. By 1994, there were 650.  Our most recent abundance estimate was 312 animals,  says Rod Hobbs of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  Scientists now suspect that noise is one of the factors contributing to their decline. Cook Inlet is a busy harbour for Alaska's largest city, Anchorage, so the waters ring to the high-intensity pile-driving noises of port expansion, shipping traffic, and seismic surveys for oil and gas exploration  2013 not to mention an airport, plus army and naval bases. For animals that navigate and communicate using sound, Cook Inlet is a noisy place.  Of course, the ocean has never been quiet. Belugas have always had to contend with noise like cracking ice, underwater earthquakes, and storms, but they've had thousands of years to adapt to these natural sounds.  The reason this [new human-caused] noise is so much of a problem today is that the animal has not had time to adapt to it,  says Robert Michaud of the Group for Research and Education on Marine Mammals.  When marine mammals are exposed at close range to a loud sound, such as navy sonar, they can be rendered temporarily deaf, just like humans who have been to a rock concert.  After you leave you don't hear as well for a little while,  says Aran Mooney of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, who identified the effect in dolphins in 2009.  When the problem is one of constant noise, belugas act just like humans at a cocktail party. If you're in a room with lots of people talking, you can change the pitch of your voice or speak up so that people can hear you. Belugas do the same. In the St. Lawrence River in Qu 00e9bec, belugas responded to boat noise by temporarily  speaking  louder.  Researchers scooped out floating whale poop with the aid of sniffer dogs  But there are limits. Once a certain noise threshold is crossed, whales can't compete, and their sounds are drowned out, a phenomenon called masking. In the St. Lawrence, noise is thought to be one of the contributing factors as to why this population, considered endangered, is in decline.  There is some evidence that noise stresses whales. In the immediate aftermath of 11 September 2001, there was reduced shipping traffic in Canada's Bay of Fundy. An opportunistic study of right whales revealed a short-term but detectable drop in oceanic noise levels, which coincided with a measurable reduction in the whales' stress levels. To show this, researchers scooped out floating whale poop with the aid of sniffer dogs, and measured levels of stress hormones within.  The belugas' plight is increasingly urgent. As Earth's climate warms up, thanks to humanity's greenhouse gas emissions, the Arctic ice is melting and passages are opening up.  There's going to be more shipping, more resource exploration and more human usage of the Arctic,  says Mooney. All those activities bring more noise,  so we want to know how sensitive or potentially sensitive belugas may be.  He is now giving them hearing tests to find out what they can and can't hear.  As we learn more about beluga calls and hearing, we can figure out exactly how they are threatened. If human activities make high-pitched noises, it might interfere with echolocation and disrupt the whales' ability to feed and navigate. However, if we make lower-frequency noises, Hobbs says,  it's going to affect their ability to communicate as a group or over long distances.   Many beluga populations are restricted to specific areas  Baby belugas may be at particularly high risk. Their calls are very low-energy, narrow-band sounds, says Vergara,  which means that they could be more easily masked by noise.  So mothers and calves could become separated in noisy environments.  Vergara's research site at Cunningham Inlet is one of the few beluga habitats not affected by man-made noise. That means Vergara is eavesdropping on  normal  mother-calf communication, which should help her colleagues understand what is happening to belugas in noisier places.  With that information to hand, she hopes to figure out what we might do to minimise the effects of our din. But according to Mooney, the solution might be quite simple. Many beluga populations are restricted to specific areas, he says.  So maybe we need to make those areas noise-free zones.   Otherwise, our noise might eventually drown out the squeaks of the belugas. Summary: Beluga whales talk to each other constantly by whistling, chirping and bleating. But man-made noise threatens to drown them out",

So, at the age of 31, Ma started his first internet company called  201cChina Yellow Pages. 201d The company made around $800,000 in the three years it was in business.  At 35, he founded Alibaba. Like Amazon, Alibaba didn 2019t make any profit in its first three years, but we know how the story ended.  Interestingly, Jack Ma has never written a line of code. Perhaps he should be a speaker at Hustle Con?  After starting his first company at 33, Ben Horowitz was often on the brink of bankruptcy.

            "input": "text:Ensnared in a  201clow-growth trap 201d, the world economy will meander along at its slowest pace since the financial crisis for a second year in a row in 2016, the OECD forecast on Wednesday, urging governments to boost spending.  With businesses wary of investing and consumers cautious about spending, the global economy will grow only 3.0 percent this year, the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimated.  That would be no better than last year (already the worst since 2009), although growth would pick up modestly to 3.3 percent next year, the OECD forecast in its biannual Economic Outlook.  Growth at those levels deprives youths of job opportunities and means old people will not get the healthcare and pension benefits they expect, OECD Chief Economist Catherine Mann told Reuters.   201cWe are breaking promises to young people and old people. Therefore policymakers have to act to break us out of the low growth trap, 201d Mann said in an interview.  With OECD countries growing on average at half their estimated potential, it would take 70 years to double living standards, twice the rate of two decades ago.  Mann warned against counting on central banks alone to lead the return to higher growth rates, saying there are now more risks than benefits in their exceptionally loose monetary policies.  Therefore, governments should not hesitate to plough money into growth-boosting initiatives like education and infrastructure, financing higher spending thanks to rock-bottom interest rates in many countries.   201cThe low interest rate environment created by the central banks opens up fiscal space to governments and we are saying that you should use it, 201d Mann said.  Though the OECD did not lower its global growth forecast from the last time it updated its estimates in February, it said the U.S. outlook had dimmed.  It cut U.S. growth for this year to 1.8 percent from its previous forecast of 2.0 percent, with weak foreign demand and a dearth of investment in the oil and mining sector being mainly to blame.  The OECD reiterated a warning that Britain would suffer a sharp slowdown in growth if voters opted in a referendum this month to leave the European Union.  In light of the political uncertainty surrounding the vote, OECD cut its forecast for 2016 British growth to 1.7 percent from 2.1 percent previously, assuming voters opted to stay in the E.U. But a vote to leave could shear half a percentage point off British growth annually in the following years, the OECD estimated.   2018Brexit 2019 aside, the outlook for the euro area had improved, with the OECD raising its growth estimate to 1.6 percent this year from 1.4 percent in February on an improved outlook for the French and German economies. Both turned in better-than-expected figures for the first quarter, although analysts warn that the rest of the year is likely to be tougher.

            "input": "text:Martha Stewart, who used her image of domestic perfection to build a multimillion-dollar company, was found guilty by a Manhattan jury yesterday of lying about the reasons she sold shares of a biotechnology company more than two years ago.  Ms. Stewart,62, is the latest and most prominent executive to be convicted since a wave of corporate scandals unfolded with the collapse of Enron.  Ms. Stewart, the founder of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, who had proclaimed her innocence from the start in public statements and through a carefully orchestrated image campaign, showed little emotion as the verdict in her trial on federal criminal charges was read aloud about 3 p.m.  ''Guilty,'' intoned the judge, Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum. Three times she would repeat the word in connection with each of the charges against Ms. Stewart, and four times again for Ms. Stewart's co-defendant, Peter E. Bacanovic, a former Merrill Lynch stockbroker who was cleared on just one charge.  A gasp went up from the crammed spectators' section as the judge spoke. Ms. Stewart's daughter Alexis, who has watched from a front-row seat since the trial began six weeks ago, slumped and began to weep. One of Ms. Stewart's lawyers, John Cuti, wiped tears from his eyes. The jury of eight women and four men sat stone-faced as each said that he or she agreed with the verdict.  Ms. Stewart, who had seemed jubilant only a week earlier when the judge threw out a securities fraud charge against her, issued a statement in which she said she was ''obviously distressed'' by the results, adding that she planned to appeal. She is scheduled to be sentenced June 17, and unless her case is overturned on appeal, she faces a punishment of up to 16 months in prison, lawyers who have dealt with the sentencing guidelines said.  The outcome raised questions about the strategy of the defense team. Ms. Stewart's lawyers spent less than 20 minutes questioning her only defense witness. [News analysis, Page C1.]  The verdict comes at a time when many former executives have pleaded guilty or have found themselves facing trial, from companies that have come to represent the excess of the 1990's stock market boom: WorldCom, Adelphia, Tyco, HealthSouth, Enron.  While those suspected crimes resulted in some of the largest bankruptcies and investor losses in history, it was Ms. Stewart's trial in a downtown Manhattan courtroom, focused on a stock sale that netted her about $45,0, that grabbed much of the spotlight.  The verdict is also a tremendous blow to the fortunes of Ms. Stewart, who rose from humble working-class roots in Nutley, N.J., to create a catering company that came to embody her clean-cut, vaguely patrician style. She would turn that into a conglomerate of publishing, television and merchandising businesses, all of them bearing her name and, usually, her photograph as well. She took her company public in 1999, as the Internet excitement peaked, and overnight became a billionaire, at least on paper.  All that seems jeopardized with yesterday's verdict, at least as far as Ms. Stewart's signature control is concerned. She will almost certainly be required to step down as an officer and director of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, although she could continue to hold the majority of the voting shares, as she does now.  Trading in her company's stock, which has plunged and rebounded several times since the investigation into her ImClone trade began, was halted as news of the verdict spread, but when it resumed a few minutes later the share price fell more than 22 percent. In a conference call on Thursday, executives from Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia said they had arranged contingency plans in case Ms. Stewart was convicted.  The outcome was a spectacular victory for prosecutors from the United States attorney's office, who had wrung a guilty plea in late 2002 from Samuel D. Waksal, the founder of ImClone and a friend of Ms. Stewart, on an assortment of charges, including securities fraud.  By the accounts of two jurors, the jury got along well and worked fairly quickly. Ms. Stewart's charges were the first they agreed on, while Mr. Bacanovic's came last, according to one juror, Chappell Hartridge. Mr. Bacanovic was cleared of a charge of false documents, after jurors concluded they could not tell when a notation on a list of Ms. Stewart's stockholdings was made.  Their quick decision also calls into question the bare-bones defense strategy of Ms. Stewart's lawyer, Robert G. Morvillo, who called only one witness and questioned him for just 20 minutes.  According to Mr. Hartridge, the decision was especially influenced by the testimony of Ms. Stewart's assistant, Ann E. Armstrong, who cried on the stand but also told the court that she had taken a particular telephone message about ImClone from Mr. Bacanovic on Dec. 27,2001, one that did not match what Mr. Bacanovic told investigators he left. The same message, ''Peter Bacanovic thinks ImClone is going to start trading downward,'' was later partly erased by Ms. Stewart after a telephone conversation with her lawyer, Ms. Armstrong said.  Ms. Stewart and Mr. Bacanovic had maintained since scrutiny of her trade first began, in early 2002 for the two of them, that they had an existing agreement to sell her ImClone shares if the price fell below $60 a share. There was no automatic sell order entered into Merrill Lynch computers, and no record of any other kind of formal agreement.  In an interview with investigators from the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Bacanovic said he had tried hard to persuade Ms. Stewart to sell the stock, and she reluctantly agreed on the $60 price. Of course, she never thought it would, he said in the interview, which was tape-recorded and played for the jury at several points during the trial. Summary: Martha Stewart is found guilty by Manhattan jury of lying about reasons she sold 3,928 shares of ImClone Systems over two years ago; Peter E Bacanovic, her former Merrill Lynch stockbroker, is also convicted; Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum sets sentencing hearing for June 17; Stewart says she plans to appeal; outcome raises questions about strategy of defense team; Stewart's lawyer Robert G Morvillo called only one witness and questioned him for just 20 minutes; photos (M)",

Get ready to follow Bionka, Nya, L.A., Xristina and Bambiana as they maneuver through their love lives, find success and are presented with a major opportunity by an influential neighbor.  Here are five things you need to know about two of  's finest, Nya and Bionka.   I knew I was trans at 6, but when I started transitioning it wasn't until 16 or 17 when I started dibbling and dabbling in dressing up,  Bionka tells PEOPLE, adding she went into being trans wearing baggy clothes because she was  depressed  and  that was all my father would give to me because he had really good relationships with the people from Cross Colours.   Nya, on the other hand, transitioned with pop culture:  I was wearing girls clothing in kindergarten and then I kind of went back and forth,  she says.  I went back to boys clothes because all the girls were wearing boys clothes  2013 like TLC, MC Lyte, Aaliyah  2013 so I was like,   Caitlyn definitely has opened the door to show what happens when someone from upper class America decides to transition, but I've seen a change happening in general,  says Bionka of the progress in the trans world since Jenner  .  Just from being on Facebook and what not, the type of guys that hit me up now are these 18-, 19-, 21-year-old guys who know I'm trans and don't care, and then you're battling these 30-, 40-, 50-year-old guys that ask if I've had bottom surgery yet and don't know if they could go there.   She continues,  Just seeing how accepted you are from youth in general goes to show, and also shows how people who are older are set in their ways.   On June 25 and 26, the women of AsiaSF will be taking the San Francisco streets by storm as the celebrity Grand Marshals for SF's Pride parade and festival.  We have five BMW convertibles and then we will be at the VIP party at City Hall,  says Nya.   Both Xristina and I were homeless and living in a shelter at one point,  Bionka says about moving from Los Angeles without a dime in her pocket.  I owe a lot to my trans sisters and people I surrounded myself with because at the time [I was transitioning], I was homeless and I was overcoming drug addiction.   She continues,  I was around all these older trans women who were telling me it's okay to be who you are, so being around them I felt comfortable transitioning.   Bionka, who is also trained in modern dance, recently recorded her debut single,  Lift Mah Shirt.    This is a newfound talent,  she says.  I know nothing about music, so going in the studio was crazy. I have two songs down.   After being named Miss Gay United States 2016 in May, she hopes to working in film and on Broadway, and she would someday love to be a professional stylist.  premieres Wednesday at 11:30 p.m. ET on Fuse.

            "input": "text:Women who consume excessive amounts of vitamin A during the early months of pregnancy can cause serious birth defects in their unborn children, a large new study has shown.  The babies of women who consumed more than 10,000 international units of vitamin A daily -- nearly four times the recommended amount -- from supplements or food or both were more likely to be born with malformations of the head, heart, brain and spinal cord.  The amounts that place babies at risk are currently found in a single pill in some vitamin preparations and can be readily obtained if more than one vitamin supplement is taken daily. In fact, one of the researchers said he and a colleague recently bought single-nutrient supplements containing 25,000 international units of vitamin A.  Although high doses of vitamin A are known to cause birth defects in laboratory animals and the vitamin's chemical relatives have damaged human infants, the new study is the first to quantify the risk of prenatal vitamin A in a large population and to establish what doses might be harmful. The study showed that 1 baby in 57 born to women taking doses of vitamin A above 10,000 international units daily was damaged as a result.  The higher the doses consumed, the greater the risk, the researchers found. Babies born to women who consumed more than 10,000 international units of the vitamin daily were 2.4 times as likely to be born with such defects as babies exposed to 5,000 international units or less. But babies exposed to 20,000 international units during the first three months of gestation were about four times as likely to be born with defects that included cleft lip, cleft palate, hydrocephalus and major heart malformations.  The study was conducted by Dr. Kenneth J. Rothman, an epidemiologist, and his colleagues at Boston University School of Medicine among 22,748 pregnant women in the Boston area who were identified between October 1984 and June 1987 and questioned in detail about what they ate and what supplements they took. The overwhelming majority of the women studied, 98.6 percent, consumed less than the amount of vitamin A identified as potentially hazardous.  Vitamin A, when taken during pregnancy, is helpful in cell differentiation and is an essential nutrient in a baby's development. But Dr. Rothman said in an interview that national surveys had indicated that 2 percent to 5 percent of women of childbearing age consumed more than 10,000 international units daily.  The findings, which are to be published on Nov. 23 in The New England Journal of Medicine, were released yesterday because of their public health importance. The researchers urged women to avoid taking supplements that exceed 4,000 to 8,000 international units daily, the amount now commonly found in prenatal multivitamins. They made a similar recommendation for women who may become pregnant.  Because vitamin A is stored in the body for long periods, women who take large amounts even during the months before becoming pregnant could place their babies at risk of malformations, the researchers suggested.  In addition to supplements, vitamin A is found in most animal foods, and in especially large amounts in liver. A three-ounce serving of cooked beef liver, for example, may contain more than 30,000 international units of it. Even if women took no supplements, those who frequently consumed liver could exceed safe levels of vitamin A, the researchers said. Other foods containing vitamin A include dairy products, eggs, meats, poultry, fish and fortified foods like certain breakfast cereals.  The researchers pointed out that beta-carotene, which the body can convert into vitamin A, is not associated with an increased risk of birth defects. Dr. Rothman said that women need not be concerned about eating too many vegetables and fruits that are rich in beta-carotene or about taking supplements that contain beta-carotene. The body converts beta-carotene into vitamin A in amounts that do not exceed safe levels.  The Council for Responsible Nutrition, an association of nutritional supplement producers, said that in 1987 it recommended that supplements supply no more than 10,000 international units of vitamin A when sold as a single nutrient and no more than 8,000 international units in prenatal multivitamins. The council also advised that products be labeled to warn women who may become pregnant not to exceed 10,000 international units daily of supplemental vitamin A.  The Boston researchers and the industry council pointed out that since the 1987 recommendation, most multivitamin producers reduced the amounts of vitamin A in each tablet or capsule and that many companies now substituted beta-carotene for vitamin A in some or all of their products. Summary: Women who consume excessive amounts of vitamin A during the early months of pregnancy can cause serious birth defects in their unborn children, a large new  study has shown.         The babies of women who consumed more than 10,000 international units of vitamin A daily -- nearly four times the recommended amount -- from supplements  or food or both were more likely to be born with malformations of the head, heart, brain and spinal cord.",

A multidisciplinary team of researchers decided to investigate the practice whereby new mothers buy breast milk from strangers online and feed it to their infants. It 2019s a practice the researchers conclude is growing 2014and fastest in the U.S. Some women unable to breastfeed see it as a healthier alternative to formula, and online breast milk is often cheaper than the kind you find at a regulated milk bank, where the milk is screened, collected, pasteurized and stored according to strict protocol, the authors say.  MORE: I Bullied Myself Into Breastfeeding  But the online market for breast milk is almost entirely unregulated and it can put young children at risk. There are no requirements to test sellers for diseases that may transmit by drinking breast milk, like HIV and hepatitis B and C, the piece says. In one 2013 study, a different group of researchers discovered that 21% of milk samples bought online tested positive for cytomegalovirus, a type of herpes virus that spreads through secretions and can have a long-term impact on the immune system.  The health concerns extend beyond hidden viruses, the researchers point out. Another study found that of 101 breast milk samples bought online, 92 of them had detectable bacterial growth 2014partly because they weren 2019t pasteurized, and partly because a quarter of them shipped so poorly that they arrived unfrozen or damaged. And breast milk, like most other liquids for which people pay a premium, seems to be a magnet for fraud. Cow 2019s milk, water and even soy milk are sometimes added as adulterants to dilute breast milk and increase its volume, says editorial co-author Sarah Steele, lecturer at the Global Health, Policy and Innovation Unit at Queen Mary University London.  MORE: 2,500 Tons of the Food We Eat Is Fake   201cAs our research has revealed, 75% of mothers go online when they have an issue with infant feeding, 201d Steele says.  201cThey resort to the internet to find out the information, usually because they 2019re embarrassed, or because they feel like they 2019re failing their infant, or because they 2019re exhausted. 201d But even though mothers are readily discovering this alternative feeding source, doctors aren 2019t talking about it, Steele says.  Infants aren 2019t the only ones drinking breast milk. Some bodybuilding websites tout it as a  201cnatural superfood 201d for adults or a drink for  201cpost-workout recovery, 201d Steele says 2014but the same risks for virus transmission apply.  In the piece, Steele and her co-authors call for more regulation of the industry.  201cEven healthcare professionals aren 2019t entirely aware of just how dangerous it is and just how many samples are contaminated, 201d she says. Despite these risks,  201cIt 2019s not a small industry, 201d Steele says.

Cleanliness, therefore, is of the first importance -- both of your persons and of your houses -- particularly your yards, sinks, privies and cesspools, where fresh chloride of lime should be daily sprinkled, and the adjoining walls and fences surrounding them repeatedly whitewashed.  Be careful that there is no stagnant water either in your cellars or yards, and if your basements are damp use fires in them frequently, to burn up the foul air and cause a more perfect ventilation.  Remove all garbage at least once a day, and twice if possible, and permit nothing to remain on the premises to undergo decomposition.  Keep your houses well ventilated.  Be temperate in all things, both in eating and drinking. Be temperate in exercise, in labor, both physical and mental. Keep good hours. Take proper food, in reasonable quantities, at proper times. Plainly cooked meats, with boiled rice, bread, and thoroughly cooked potatoes, should form the ordinary base of diet.  Abstain from all unripe fruits, and stale or partially decayed vegetables. But above all, avoid excess in intoxicating drinks of every kind.  Wear flannel next the skin, and at all times maintain the natural temperature of the body by a sufficient amount of clothing. Avoid all exposure to sudden changes of temperature, and if accidentally exposed to a storm, remove your wet boots and clothing as soon as possible.  The cholera is not the necessarily fatal disease which it is commonly believed to be, but is a disease that is both preventable and curable. It Is always preceded by symptoms of languor and debility, with diarrhea, and in this stage is almost always curable; but if neglected at this period, and the diarrhea permitted to continue until collapse comes on, it is then almost always fatal.  At the very commencement of the disease go to bed, and stay there until you are well, with warm flannel around the body, warm bricks or bottles of hot water to the feet, if necessary, and if there is a tendency to vomit, apply a mustard plaster over the stomach. If you have not got a bed, lie down on the floor and keep yourself warm; but by all means retain the horizontal position all the time -- not even getting up to attend to the evacuations, but use a bed-pan or other convenience for that purpose; and immediately send for some qualified physician for advice. But, above all things, abstain from taking any of the advertised nostrums that will flood the city, and swallow no medicine unless prescribed by a competent physician.  The Commissioners of Health are doing all in their power for the purification of the city and the protection of the people; but it must be evident to all that they cannot do everything, and would therefore respectfully call upon their fellow-citizens to cooperate with them in every possible way in their power.  Sources of filth and impurity may exist without the knowledge of the public authorities, and every citizen should feel the necessity of keeping a watchful supervision over his own premises; and when individual efforts are inadequate for their removal, they should call upon the board for aid and assistance.  Fear and despondency are the great sources of danger in all epidemics, but more especially in cholera than any other.  While, therefore, we would urge upon all our citizens the use of every prudential and precautionary measure, let them preserve a calm and composed state of mind, a cheerful heart, and dispel all fear -- and by a confiding trust in an all-wise and merciful Providence, we can reasonably hope to escape this scourge, if we implicitly obey His laws.

Now, heading into what is expected to be a tough general election with presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, Trump appears to be getting serious about raising campaign cash. Since securing the nomination, Trump has begun encouraging donations, attending several organized fundraisers, and on Thursday, he held a meeting with donors in New York.  Here 2019s a look at some of the key members of Trump 2019s campaign finance apparatus:  While it is not the first time Mnuchin will work alongside Trump, the GOP candidate 2019s national finance chairman is tasked with bringing his  201cexpertise 201d in finance to operate an  201cextremely successful 201d joint fundraising entity with the Republican National Committee.  Mnuchin, the former chairman and CEO of Dune Capital Management LP, a private investment firm, has a history of donating to both Republican and Democratic candidates. He donated repeatedly to Hillary Clinton for her Senate run and first presidential campaign -- and also holds business ties to some of Clinton 2019s mega donors.  Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets, may be headed to the playoffs of the election  2013- as he joins the Trump train. The now-vice chairman of The Trump Victory Committee was previously the finance chairman for Jeb Bush and Trump once chastised him for it.   201cWoody Johnson, owner of the NYJets, is @JebBush 2019s finance chairman. If Woody would 2019ve been w me, he would 2019ve been in the playoffs, at least! 201d Trump tweeted back in January.  But Johnson and Trump have since patched things up.   201cI think they confuse his persona with the kind of person he actually is, 201d Johnson said.  201cYou have to see him through his kids, in a way, and his wife. 201d  Washburne, a Dallas investor and newly-appointed vice chairman of The Trump Victory Committee fundraising partnership between the RNC and the Trump campaign, is running Trump 2019s finance committee.  The former RNC finance chairman, who stepped down last year to lead New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie 2019s finance team, recently laid out an ambitious fundraising goal.   201cIt 2019ll be $1 billion plus, 201d Washburne said in an interview with the Dallas Morning News, adding,  201cthere 2019s only one team to be on at this point. 201d  Barrack, a real estate investor, announced his support of Trump in February and, ahead of the California primaries, held the first fundraiser for Trump at his home in the Golden State.  Barrack threw his financial backing to Rebuilding America Now, the new Donald Trump super PAC, which in an interview with CNN, Barrack said had raised $32 million.  The Rebuilding America Now PAC also spent $1.1 million in national airtime in targeted states starting June 8 with its first ad attacking the Clintons.  Hendricks, a Wisconsin businesswoman who was a top financial contributor for Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, has been chosen to join Washburne and four others as vice chairs of The Trump Victory Committee.  The billionaire co-founder and chairman of ABC Supply contributed $5 million to Unintimidated PAC, a super PAC created to support Walker 2019s failed presidential campaign.  Sheldon Adelson is a member of America 2019s mega-rich. The owner of the casino company, Las Vegas Sands, Forbes estimates his net worth at $26.9 billion.  A source within the Trump campaign confirmed to ABC News that Adelson, who endorsed Trump last month, will contribute a substantial amount of money to Trump's campaign. The New York Times reported that Adelson is willing to fish out $100 million or more to Trump.  In the 2012 election, he single-handedly funded Republican candidate Newt Gingrich's campaign, and once Gingrich dropped out, gave millions to GOP nominee Mitt Romney.  ABC 2019s Shushannah Walshe, John Santucci and Meghan Keneally contributed to this report. Summary: During the primary season, presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump boasted of self-funding his campaign.But, he accepted some individual contributions too.Now, heading into what is expected to be a tough general election with presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, Trump appears to...",

            "input": "text:Mia Hamm has been a role model for girls since she established herself as one of the greatest female athletes of all time. Hamm held the record for most international goals scored by a soccer player  2014 male or female  2014 until 2013, when fellow American Abby Wambach broke her record. She won FIFA world player of the year twice.  Since her retirement from soccer, Hamm has been active in other pursuits: participating in an ESPN documentary about the 1999 American soccer team that won the Women 2019s World Cup, heading up the Mia Hamm Foundation and raising her twin daughters.  But now she 2019s teaming up with LeapFrog to promote the LeapBand, a fitness tracker for kids that lets them play games while staying active. Last weekend, Hamm and LeapFrog met with 400 kids and families in Santa Monica, Calif., to promote family activities. The group set three Guinness World Records for most people making sand angels (292), most people hopping on one leg (321) and most people performing a swim dance (318).  TIME caught up with Hamm to talk about controversy surrounding the upcoming Women 2019s World Cup, what it was like to race against Michael Jordan for a Gatorade commercial and how to get more kids to be active.  There 2019s been a lot of renewed interest in America in soccer after the World Cup this summer. Do you think people are going to be as invested in this upcoming Women 2019s World Cup as they were in the Men 2019s ?  I think so. I think with this World Cup what made a huge difference is that people have access that they didn 2019t have 10 years ago or 20 years ago. I could go home right now and find four channels that have something about soccer going on, and I definitely could not have done when I was playing. I believe Fox Sports 1 has all the coverage [of the Women 2019s World Cup], and they are taking it very seriously in terms of the reach that they want to obtain. In the end that 2019s how you get to the masses is with that type of coverage.  With regards to the U.S. team and the tournament, it 2019s going to be the best soccer that 2019s been played to this date. The game 2019s naturally evolving and getting better.  Some of the women 2019s players in the U.S. and elsewhere have expressed concerns about playing on turf for the next world cup. What are your thoughts on the turf vs. grass debate?  I would much rather play on grass. I 2019ve played on turf, and it is a different game. I completely understand why certain venues have turf because of the amount of play, the wear and tear, the weather. But I would love for this tournament  2014 it 2019s the best of the best in the world, it 2019s senior players, it 2019s not a youth world cup  2014 for FIFA to remain consistent, and right now that means playing the game on grass, on a natural surface.  My favorite commercial growing up was the Gatorade commercial that you did with Michael Jordan  2014 the  201cAnything You Can Do I Can Do Better 201d commercial  2014 and several female athletes I 2019ve interviewed since have cited it as an inspiration as well. You were one of the first women to send the message,  201cI can compete with the boys. 201d Were you aware that you were a female role model at the time?  Definitely. I took every opportunity as a responsibility to not only help our sport grow but also to support female athletics. I felt it was important. And it was also a way for me to say thank you to all the people that invested in me and who, whether I knew them or not, made changes to compete at this level  2014 whether it was playing in college and the birth of Title IX and making sure that not only did I have access to being able to play in college but I had access to an education.  What was so wonderful was during the taping of that, I wanted to be better than he was at whatever we were doing. It was actually very intense. There was a natural competition. And I love the fact that he was accepting and open to that. We had a blast making it.  You 2019ve done a lot to encourage young girls in athletics. Why has that been an important cause for you?  I just know how it empowered me. I was a really young, shy kid who was also from a military family, so we moved every 2-3 years. And sports was an easy way to make a connection when we moved to a new base, a new town to people with similar interests. And I think it really helped give me confidence not only with that move but with feeling that I could contribute.  We 2019re finally starting to see more attention paid to women 2019s sports. Do you think we will ever reach point where there 2019s as much encouragement for young girls to play sports as young boys and as much interest in women 2019s sports as men 2019s?  I hope so. You just look at women in high-powered positions in top 500 companies and a lot of them will attribute their time in organized sports as something that really made a difference and had an impact in their lives. And I see the confidence it has built in my daughters when they work really hard at something, let 2019s say it 2019s soccer. They 2019re working really hard on passing or shooting or a certain move, and then all of the sudden it just clicks, and you just see this big smile come on their face.  And to see that confidence grow in a young girl is so important because I think boys are naturally encouraged to do those things, and the opportunities to do it for our daughters is so important.  I know that your 1999 World Cup win had a huge impact on my generation in terms of the number of girls it inspired to play soccer. But soccer 2019s continued to grow in popularity in the U.S. for boys and girls. Why do you think that is?  I think kids who grew up playing and it was part of their everyday lives are now parents. I would probably say if we hadn 2019t lived in Italy when I was 2 or 3, my dad would have been like,  201cWhat is this game? What are these kids playing? 201d because he didn 2019t grow up around it. We 2019re parents now, we understand the game, and our kids are playing.  I also know when I was younger, it was a relatively inexpensive sport to play. You didn 2019t need a lot of equipment. I was one of six kids in a military family, so it was perfect. Times have changed with club soccer and all the traveling and high-level coaching, but it 2019s still a sport you can play on a field used for many different sports  2014 football, lacrosse or even the outfield of a baseball field, which is what my daughters do here in California when they play in their little AYSO league.  Obviously you and your husband [former baseball player Nomar Garciaparra] are athletic people. Have you passed those genes to your kids? What do you guys do to stay active?  We want them participating in some type of activity. And they 2019re motivated to be with their friends. Whether it 2019s dance or playing soccer or softball. At home, we want it to be fun. We 2019re not standing over our kids saying  2018give me ten pushups! 2019 Two days ago, my daughter wanted to play two square, so we put that in the space between our family room and kitchen. And we did that for 20 minutes, just laughing and I think she was talking a little trash at one point. So just having fun with them.  Why did you team up with LeapFrog?  Seventy-five percent of kids aren 2019t gettingthe 60 minutes a day of physical activity, whether it 2019s due to cutbacks in their school 2019s physical education programs, and you know childhood obesity rates are skyrocketing. We just really want to help families and kids understand that physical activity is not necessarily about work. LeapBand is not a calorie tracker or counter. It 2019s little bursts of activities like jumping in place and popping like popcorn. I know for my kids, they 2019re always laughing while doing it.  Have you tried any fitness trackers?  Yeah, the Nike FuelBand, I 2019ve used that. I was more curious: how many steps do I take in a day? I kind of had an idea of my calorie burn when I was playing, but I have no idea right now. I do a camp with a couple of my teammates, and we 2019ll go out and motivate each other, see what we can do.

A New York artist drives nails into Barbie, calling it sculpture.  What 2019s going on here? How did Barbie, history 2019s most popular doll, celebrating her 50th year as a beloved plaything for girls worldwide, become an object that females of all ages cut, burn, bend, spindle and mutilate? And what does it all mean?  Let 2019s start with girls. Barbie is, after all, supposed to be a toy. In 2005, researchers at England 2019s University of Bath, conducting a study of how children play, were surprised at what girls do to their Barbies.   201cThe types of mutilation are varied and creative, and range from removing the hair to decapitation, burning, breaking and even microwaving, 201d writes Dr. Agnes Nairn.  201cThe girls we spoke to see Barbie torture as a legitimate play activity, and see the torture as a  2018cool 2019 activity in contrast to other forms of play with the doll. 201d  The study 2019s conclusion 2013that the abuse means that Barbie is a  201chate figure 201d among 7- to 11-year-old girls 2013sparked debate all over the world.  Some felt that Barbie was merely getting her due as a poor role model; others argued that battering a Barbie is no different than, say, battering a red wagon 2013only with a cultural touchstone like Barbie, we notice.  The study 2019s conclusions  201csmack of academic overanalysis, 201d Anastasia de Waal wrote in The Guardian,  201cof grown-ups getting too excited about the symbolism of child 2019s play.  2026 Testing the versatility and robustness of one 2019s toys is neither new nor sinister. 201d  While the study emphasized the hostility suggested by hacking something apart, the girls actually told researchers they didn 2019t despise Barbie so much as feel they had outgrown her.   201cThe most readily expressed reason for rejecting Barbie was that she was babyish and girls saw her as representing their younger childhood out of which they felt they had now grown, 201d said Nairn.  When you turn to adults, however, the contempt behind the violence is undeniable. Barbie is not just the most popular doll of all time, she is also a large-busted, slim-waisted, impossibly proportioned ideal that has long inspired odium among feminists.   201cWomen my age know whom to blame for our own self-loathing, eating disorders and distorted body image: Barbie, 201d Chicago Tribune columnist Amy Dickenson wrote.  One of the more memorable Barbie mutilations happened in 1993 at Christmas time. Dozens of girls whose parents purchased  201cTeen Talk 201d Barbies were surprised to hear their new dolls growl phrases such as  201cdead men tell no lies 201d and  201cvengeance is mine. 201d Meanwhile, boys pressed the buttons of their new  201cTalking Duke 201d G.I. Joe and heard him coo,  201cLet 2019s plan our dream wedding. 201d  A group of Manhattan parents, dubbing itself the  201cBarbie Liberation Organization, 201d had purchased a number of the dolls 2013they claimed 300 2013and  201csurgically 201d switched their voice box devices, giving Barbie her bellicose outlook and Joe his sudden interest in shopping.  The prank echoes the sense of humor often seen in Barbie mangling. Montana artist Dawn Duane Evans 2019  201cI Hate Barbie 201d calendar photos aren 2019t so much malicious as mocking, with Barbies splashing in cans of paint and labeled a  201cPop Tart, 201d peeking, smoldering from toasters.  Of course, most women are not angry artists. When you talk to adult women who abused their Barbies, their motives were inevitably benign.  Ginny Voedisch, who works for the Art Institute of Chicago, did put her Barbie in an oven, but not out of spite 2013she thought the heat would turn her early 1960s bouffant hairdo into a then-hip late 1960s afro (it didn 2019t). Marj Halperin, a media consultant, stuck straight pins into her Barbie 2019s head, true, but she was attaching sequin earrings.   201cOooh! I loved Barbie and would never ever have mutilated her! 201d said Amy Latreille, a customer service manager.  201cHowever, cutting her hair, reversing her arms and even changing their heads was totally okay. 201d (Several women said that swapping heads on the identically bodied dolls was far easier for a girl to do than changing their elaborate outfits.)  Even those who said they disliked Barbie were acting more from indifference than hostility.  Sharon Allen, a mechanic, melted her Barbie and seemed surprised at the idea she wouldn 2019t.  201cIt seemed the obvious thing to do, 201d she said.  201cBarbies were just so boring. I never really liked them. You couldn 2019t really do anything with them 2013except, of course, melt them. 201d  Altering your Barbie could also be a way of bringing her with you on your latest life change. When Kirsten Curley, now a senior corporate manager, went through her rebellious high school fashion phase, her  201clast surviving Barbie came along. 201d   201cShe got a Mohawk hair-do, black lipstick, torn clothes and a safety pin through her ear, 201d said Curley.  The way the adult world can impose meaning on Barbie mutilation is demonstrated by Susan Ginsberg 2019s (now a Chicago mother of two herself) alarm at finding a Ziploc bag of hair in her daughter 2019s drawers.   201cI was mortified, 201d she said.  201cIs one of my kids partaking in witchcraft?

The changes are designed by the Government to encourage investment in network improvements, amid concern that the uncertain cost of building new masts is holding back coverage.  Under the new rules, mobile operators and independent mast owners such as Arqiva and Wireless Infrastructure Group, will be able to apply to the courts to force land owners to sell space for a mast at the same price any other buyer would pay.  The industry has complained that in situations where there are few suitable sites for infrastructure in an area it can be held to  201cransom 201d by the landowner and charged multiples of the market rent. In such circumstances operators and mast companies sometimes elect not to build, leaving coverage blackspots that the Government is seeking to eliminate.  While the legislation mostly targets rural areas, it could also apply in cities.  Whitehall sources said the new powers would put the mobile industry on more level terms with water and power companies, who have long been able to make compulsory purchases to provide essential services.  It is hoped by senior industry figures that the powers will be used rarely and act as a backstop to encourage landlords to enter commercial negotiations on reasonable terms. Problems are already quite rare, one mobile source said.  The new legislation, part of a new digital economy bill, is likely to prove controversial but comes after the Prime Minister said politicians had been wrong to stand in the way of mobile mast building.  Ed Vaizey, the communications minister, said:  201cWhat was once seen as a luxury is now a basic need, and people expect to have access to fast broadband at home, irrespective of where they live, and use their mobile devices anywhere they go. 201d  The new power could also aid plans to expand BT's EE network so it is capable of replacing the emergency services radio system, a contract the Government claims will save taxpayers  00a31m per day.  The digital economy bill is also expected to make it harder for telecoms companies to sue Ofcom.  The tougher legal hurdles could help the regulator set the terms of forthcoming sales of mobile spectrum to help Three and O2 with less fear of a legal challenge from BT and Vodafone. Three 2019s owner CK Hutchison said its low allocation was a key motivation behind its failed attempt to buy O2, which Ofcom opposed and was blocked.  The regulator has since said it will aim to support competition in the market via auctions of mobile airwaves.

            "input": "text:Olympic gymnast John Orozco is determined to make 2016 his best year yet.  A medal-less performance at the 2012 London Olympics and months of grueling rehab for a torn Achilles heel haven't deterred the 23-year-old from chasing gold in Rio  2013 he's working harder than ever in preparation for the Games this summer. But the extra hours Orozco puts in at the gym aren't just for himself. He trains to honor his mother, who died suddenly in 2015.   It's a new me,  Orozco tells PEOPLE.  I've changed as an athlete and as a person and I hope it shows through my gymnastics, that's what I'm looking forward to at these next Olympic Games  00e2 0080 00a6 My mom will definitely be watching over me in Rio, cheering me on.   After a pause, he adds,  I have a different demeanor. I'm a little more positive, easier on myself. It takes the stress away and that allows me to do my job.   Orozco grew up in the Bronx in New York City and from a young age his mother, Damaris, recognized the potential for greatness in her son. Damaris would drive him to a training facility an hour away in Chappaqua, New York, for the kind of coaching necessary to become an Olympian  2013 and she often did it twice a day.  On trips to meets, the mother and son would sleep in their car  2013 as the family often didn't have enough money to stay in hotels. The devoted mother also stood up for her son as he endured bullying from friends and schoolmates in their neighborhood.  Orozco says his mother was his number one fan and fully believed in his goal to one day compete in the Olympics. And to win gold.  Today marks one year since I lost my Mom,my friend,my biggest fan, and my hero. I know you're always watching over me, but I wish I could have just one more hug, one more laugh, one more dance,one more conversation, or just have you by my side. The very last thing I said to you was that I was proud of you and I really meant it. I miss you so much sometimes it's unbearable, but you taught me how to be strong and fight through the pain no matter what and to never ever give up till the very end. I'd give anything to ask you for five bucks so I can go to the corner store to buy a roses, chocolates, and cut out a piece of red pink construction paper to write you a poem like we use to when I was little. Happy Valentines Day ma. I love you, Siempre. R.I.P.  A photo posted by John Orozco (@johnorozcousa) on Feb 14, 2016 at 10:26am PST  After a disappointing performance for the frontrunner at the 2012 Olympics  2013 the U.S. men finished fifth in team finals and the favored Orozco failed to medal  2013 he decided to put the past behind him.   I don't think about 2012 at all,  he says.  Everything that happened in 2012 happened. I'm so grateful for the experience, and now it's on to bigger and better things.   And then the unthinkable happened. Orozco's rock, his motivation and  best friend  died suddenly in February 2015.   I knew [competing] would be hard without my mom. I thought to myself, 'You have to be strong like she was,'   says Orozco.  I picked myself up ... I thought 'I can get through this and be okay.'     I know what I need to do. I took some time to be sad and cry and say, 'Why me,' and after those few weeks I think it was necessary to acknowledge that life isn't fair,  says Orozco.  I believe that you have to pick yourself up however you can and tell yourself these are the cards I was dealt with and I have to make the best of my situation.   Overcoming nearly insurmountable grief, Orozco decided to continue his gymnastics career in honor of his late mother.   When I have my moments of weakness, I remember her and her strength and that helps me get through times when I feel weak or when I can't handle anything,  he says.  I have a rosary that I always travel with ... it helps me feel a little closer to her because she had it blessed by the priest at my church in the Bronx. I bring it everywhere because it makes me feel safe and closer to her.   Whenever I feel like I need some faith I pray with it and ask her for advice ... I'll bring it with me to Rio.   Orozco starts every morning rehabbing the right Achilles heel he tore in June 2015 ( I competed seven months after getting injured, which is like  the time it usually takes,  he says) at the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado. From 9:00 a.m. until noon he works on events and half routines. When morning practice is done, he puts on compression pants to take the swelling out of his legs.  For lunch he has a chicken burger, turkey breast and plain lettuce ( I know I need veggies! ) or if he's short on time, he heads to Chipotle and orders a burrito with brown rice and double chicken.  Afternoon practice starts at 3:30 p.m. and lasts until 6 p.m. Orozco and his teammates take ice baths afterwards.   I'm training smarter,  he says.  I go into the gym and focus and have a plan and train with quality over quantity.   When he gets back to his dorm-style room at the training center he sits at his computer and pulls up GarageBand.   I love to make music... sometimes I'll start off creating R&B and then all of a sudden it goes into an electronic EDM sound. I also sing on my own tracks,  says Orozco, who is featured in Gym Class Heroes' video for  The Fighter.   The elite athlete explains that music  2013 amidst all of the pressure he faces during gymnastics training  2013 is a way for him to relax.   Maybe one day I'll go to Broadway!  he jokes.  But for now, Rio is all I see.  Summary:  My mom will definitely be watching over me in Rio, cheering me on, 00e2 0080 009d John Orozco tells PEOPLE of his late mother",

            "input": "text:Another day brings another new electric automaker. Call them  201cTesla rivals. 201d Maybe, if you 2019re feeling especially bold,  201cTesla killers. 201d All of these new ambitious ventures demonstrate the growing interest in electric transportation. But they also reveal a collective amnesia about just how difficult it really is to build a new automotive startup from scratch.  The newest one comes courtesy of a Reuters report, which describes a brand-new, Shanghai-based startup called NextEV backed by a group of Chinese Internet entrepreneurs. The company says it will launch an electric supercar in 2016.  Investors in NextEV reportedly include Hillhouse Capital, which also backed Uber, and Chinese Internet giant Tencent. The company appears to have hired executives from Ford F , Tesla TSLA , and BMW BAMXY .  And that 2019s just the latest company aiming to compete on some level with Tesla. A couple of months ago the new  201cTesla rival 201d was Faraday Future, a startup based in Gardena, Calif. That company was reportedly founded last year, and already has 200 employees 2014including some from Tesla. The plan is to launch their first electric car in 2017. It 2019s unclear who 2019s funding the venture.  At one point battery startup Boston Power was also dubbed a Tesla rival, largely due to its plans to build a sizable battery factory and partner with Chinese automakers to build a low-cost electric car. Boston Power was originally founded in the U.S., but moved to China in 2011 when the funding for battery tech in the U.S. got difficult.  Boston Power has been funded by GSR Ventures, a venture firm that funds businesses to grow in China. Boston Power chairman Sonny Wu (who 2019s also a managing partner with GSR Venures) told the Wall Street Journal at the time of the last funding round that the firm funded the company because  201csomebody 201d had to compete with Elon Musk.  Last year Bay Area startup Renovo Motors emerged from stealth after four years in development with a really high-end electric supercar called the  201cRenovo Coupe. 201d With Silicon Valley backers, and the use of lithium-ion batteries, it 2019s like a racing-version of a budding Tesla.  There 2019s also Fisker Automotive, which despite it 2019s spectacular crash and burn two years ago, still has plans to re-launch under its new owner Chinese auto-parts giant Wanxiang. The company has plans to build a factory in Moreno Valley, Calif. that will employ 150 workers. Another 240 people work at the company 2019s headquarters in Costa Mesa, Fisker says.  There are a variety of reasons why this group of new startups is attempting to follow in the footsteps of Tesla and tempt fate by launching an electric car out of an independent car company.  Many of these startups have no doubt been encouraged by the successes of Tesla. The company has made its founder and early employees wealthy, and its Model S sedan has been so well-received that it aced its Consumer Reports rating.  But launching a new car requires, on the very low end, hundreds of millions of dollars. On the higher end, it requires more than a billion dollars. The business is naturally at odds with the type of financing a tech startup can raise. That 2019s partly why Tesla made it through the hard times, because Musk already had money to support the company when it needed it.  The list of car companies that haven 2019t worked in only the past few years include Aptera, Coda Automotive, Think Automotive, Wheego, and Fisker. (Am I forgetting anything?)  Tesla 2019s success overshadows that the company spent over a decade beating all odds. The company almost died several times. It almost sold to Google GOOG during hard times two years ago. It almost went out of business as it was preparing to produce its first vehicle, the Roadster.  Tesla will also likely go through some hard times ahead. It continues to borrow and raise money to get its next cars, the Model X and Model 3, out the door and its massive Gigafactory battery factory up and running. Tesla is still operating like a startup and taking on the risks of a startup. When Tesla hits some hurdles, which is no doubt will, will it scare off some of these eager startups?  Meanwhile, it 2019s not surprising that new electric car startups would emerge out of China. China is very interested in building domestic electric car tech, offering support for battery and auto companies that are willing to build factories in China. The country also discourages vehicles that burn gasoline in certain regions, and is trying to cut down on car driving to reduce its infamously bad air pollutions.  As the country did with solar panels, China is willing to heavily over-support domestic technology and markets that it wants to get into. This leads to a constant boom and bust cycle. There will likely be a bunch of Chinese electric car startups that will gain fame and potentially crash and burn.  Reuters reports that the Chinese government has recently decided to encourage investment in the sector from non-automotive companies. The Chinese Internet investors in NextEV are just one group backing a new electric car startup, says Reuters.  Alibaba and Xiaomi Technology are also considering investments in electric car companies, according to the report. Encouraging specifically non-automotive companies to invest in the sector will likely only heighten this boom and bust cycle.  Chinese Internet companies could also partly be interested in backing electric car startups as a way to try to compete with electric car tech that Apple and Google are reportedly building. If you believe the reports, Apple is aggressively developing an electric car with the project name Titan.  But overall, the trend of new entrepreneurs and investors becoming interested in electric car tech shows how the tide around electric transportation could slowly be turning. Electric cars make up only a fraction of cars sold in the U.S., but that 2019s ever so slowly starting to change. In certain countries, like Norway, electric cars make up an already large portion of new cars sold.  When better and cheaper electric cars hit the market, more people will no doubt buy them. The reality is that there really are no Tesla competitors currently out there. The technology is at its very earliest stage, and is being pushed forward by Tesla.  Real electric car competition will eventually be a very good thing. It will mean consumers and companies have embraced electric cars as a thriving and substantial market.  But it could very well take a big auto maker with deep pockets to fund cars that could truly rival Tesla. The big auto companies just have to take the market seriously enough.

In all the time Trump had been gone, political media has obsessed over Melania Trump 2019s apparently plagiarized paragraph in her speech to the Republican National Convention. It should have been a one-day story, or even just in the press for a few hours. But the Trump campaign 2019s inability to admit error ensured it had at least a three-day lifespan. Finally they admitted the obvious Wednesday afternoon, that portions of the speech had been lifted from Michelle Obama 2019s, saying an aide was responsible. This comes after a series of denials and lies from the campaign and Republican surrogates that nothing was wrong, as Republican Party officials shook their heads at the Trump campaign 2019s hard-headedness.

            "input": "text:The summer solstice is June 20, the longest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. But do the extra hours of sunshine make you happier?  In general, people are more cheerful in the summertime, according to Philip Gehrman, associate director of the Behavioral Sleep Medicine Program at the University of Pennsylvania. Light serves as the strongest cue to regulate circadian rhythms, which include the sleep cycle, hormonal fluctuations and body temperature and follow a roughly 24-hour pattern.   201cPeople tend to feel better in summer months, 201d Gehrman said.  201cThere 2019s a slight elevation in our mood. More positive emotions are reported. 201d  But the effect isn 2019t uniform 2014circadian rhythms vary from person to person, so the amount and timing of sunlight means different things to different people, said Dr. Irina V. Zhdanova, a neuroscience professor at Boston University. For example, morning sunlight can irritate people who wake up late. On the other hand, for people who rise early, morning sunlight can have a positive effect, but sunlight may irritate them in the evening.  It 2019s similar to meal habits, Zhdanova said.   201cSome like three meals a day, others like 10 small meals a day, 201d Zhdanova said.  201cSometimes sunlight is good and uplifting during a certain time of the day, while for others, it 2019s neither uplifting or positive and can induce mild irritation. 201d  The extra sunlight also entrains the circadian rhythm, a process in which the internal biological clock aligns itself to external cues, like the light-dark cycle. Now that the days are longer, in general, the circadian rhythm is entrained much better, Zhdanova said. In other words, the circadian rhythm is better aligned with natural sunlight and darkness, which can affect people 2019s sleep and moods.  However, Gehrman said, it is unclear whether elevated moods come from more entrained circadian rhythms and better sleep, or if the happiness boost is directly attributable to the sunlight.  On the flip side, experiencing less sunlight in the winter can pose a challenge, said Frank Scheer, director of the Medical Chronobiology Program at Brigham and Women 2019s Hospital.   201cThe lengthening or shortening of the light period during the day does have a clear effect, 201d Scheer said.  201cIn wintertime, when the days are shorter, we are more likely to wake up when it 2019s still dark outside and before the circadian system stimulates wakefulness and improved mood. 201d  So, enjoy the longest day of the year while it lasts 2014the days will start getting shorter again from here.

            "input": "text:It was the most significant news conference in Baltimore in decades. Marilyn Mosby, the Baltimore City state 2019s attorney, stood on the steps of the city 2019s War Memorial Building on May 1,2015, and announced that the six officers involved in the arrest of Freddie Gray, a black man who died in police custody, would be criminally charged, including one with second-degree murder.  That day, National Guard troops were still roaming the streets following riots not seen in this majority black city in half-a-century. Officials had struggled to maintain order in the days following Gray 2019s death. Businesses had been looted and set on fire. Police officers had been injured. But with one news conference, Mosby did what other officials could not: Give black residents who routinely complained of discrimination from law enforcement the hope that justice may be coming.  On Wednesday, that hope vanished. The Freddie Gray trials resulted in zero convictions more than a year after Mosby 2019s dramatic announcement of charges. Three officers have been acquitted, and the charges pending against three other officers were dropped this week.  For Mosby, the lack of any guilty verdicts comes after a dramatic rise that made her a national figure and a symbol of the Black Lives Matter movement. But her future in the city now is uncertain. While she still appears to have the support of black communities who cheered her decision to criminally charge Baltimore police, her critics said that coming away empty-handed proves she was too inexperienced for the job and rushed to judgment in charging the officers.   201cThere 2019s a vulnerability there, and it could play out in the next election, 201d said John Bullock, a Towson University political science professor.  201cClearly she 2019s young and that was questioned by some. But at the same time, others will say that she did her best, she brought charges, and due to the justice system working the way it has, they didn 2019t get justice. 201d  MORE Inside the Fight to Change Baltimore 2019s Police Department One Year After Freddie Gray  There have been calls for Mosby to resign over her handling of the trials. A law professor has filed a complaint against Mosby in an attempt to get her disbarred in Maryland, and five of the officers charged have sued Mosby, alleging they were falsely arrested and imprisoned. In an interview with Baltimore 2019s WJZ, Mosby adamantly refused to step down.   201cWhat I can say is that I was elected by the people of Baltimore City, and there 2019s no way 2014absolutely no way 2014that I will ever resign, 201d she said.  Mosby was elected state 2019s attorney in 2014 at age 34, becoming the youngest big-city top prosecutor in the U.S. After just months on the job, Gray died in police custody from a severe spinal injury after being arrested by Baltimore police, pushing Mosby into the national spotlight. Within weeks, her office had issued unprecedented criminal charges against the six officers involved in Gray 2019s arrest.  The charges quickly made Mosby a divisive figure, praised by black communities but criticized by police for appearing to side with protesters, especially after her statement that she had heard demonstrators 2019 calls of  201cno justice, no peace. 201d  Even with the lack of convictions, however, Mosby does not appear to have lost the support of black residents still angry over Gray 2019s fatal arrest. During Mosby 2019s brief remarks Wednesday in Sandtown-Winchester, the predominantly black neighborhood where Gray was arrested, the state 2019s attorney received vocal support from many nearby while Gray 2019s step-father said the family stands by her.  Baltimore political experts said they still expect Mosby to run for re-election in 2018, but she may be challenged in ways she wasn 2019t two years ago.   201cI think she still has a future, but it 2019s not as bright, 201d said Matthew Crenson, a Johns Hopkins University political science professor, adding that it would be a  201cstretch 201d for Mosby to run for mayor or statewide office.  201cShe has very little of a constituency outside of Baltimore. 201d  David Jaros, a University of Baltimore law professor, said Mosby 2019s political future may not hinge on the outcome of the Gray cases.   201cBaltimore is struggling with a variety of issues that urban America is struggling with, 201d he says.  201cAnd her future may be shaped by what happens in Baltimore 201d regardless of the Freddie Gray cases.  Mosby reached the state 2019s attorney 2019s office in part because she was able to get support from across the city in both white and black neighborhoods, said Bullock of Towson University. But after the trials, that will likely be much more difficult.  201cThe question is whether neighborhoods that don 2019t look like Sandtown will still be responsive to her message, 201d he said.  201cBut I believe her core supporters will be there. 201d Summary: Marilyn Mosby faces an uncertain future",

Zulawski, who began shooting with the support of the Polish government, was ordered to cease production in 1977, a fact referred to in voice-over that was added 10 years later, when the filmmaker patched together a final version of what he referred to as his  201cmurdered 201d masterwork.  It is that version  2014 150 minutes of passionate and complicated science fiction, interspersed with documentary footage of ordinary Poles going about terrestrial business in the final days of Communism  2014 that reaches North America in a digital restoration on Friday. (An excellent account of the film 2019s curious history, by the critic Zach Lewis, can be found at the website mubi.com).  To say that  201cOn the Silver Globe 201d is unlike anything else being released this summer is a drastic understatement. Zulawski, who died in February, was one of the last great renegades of European art cinema, a wildly inventive, madly ambitious artist who infused his films with the spirit of experimental theater, avant-garde literature and speculative philosophy. He also filled them with sex, absurdity and flights of melodramatic emotion.   201cOn the Silver Globe 201d is based on parts of a trilogy of novels by the director 2019s great-uncle Jerzy Zulawski, an early-20th-century writer and thinker. It is thick with incident and dense with sometimes murky ideas about the fate of mankind, the nature of love and the contradictory human desires for power and freedom. The extraordinary opening shot, of a horseman galloping through a snowy, mountainous landscape, evokes westerns and samurai movies. The horseman arrives at a decrepit cluster of buildings  2014 they look like 19th-century factories or government offices  2014 where two astronauts await him. They have been on this planet a long time, and the nature of their mission takes a while to emerge.  If, that is, it ever does. A chronologically fragmented narrative takes shape, one that spans generations of human habitation on this strange and hostile world. Later scenes take place in caves and on a windswept seashore. An earlier group of space travelers from Earth settled and bred there. Later generations would fight wars with the bird-creatures and also have sex with them, begetting a hybrid species and further conflict.  All of this is conveyed in phantasmagoric, low-tech compositions and long following shots of people expostulating on matters that are not always clear, even to them. A certain amount of work is required to stitch together a sense of the plot, but as is often the case in Zulawski 2019s films, the story is less the point than an excuse, a loose temporal conceit holding together flights of visual invention, verbal extravagance and male and female nudity.  That  201cOn the Silver Globe 201d does not really hold together is surely the fault of the long-gone government that prevented its completion. The most intriguing thing about watching it now may be the daydream it provokes of an alternative history. Imagine if Zulawski, who returned from exile in the West to undertake this project, had brought it to full fruition. What would the critics have thought? What would its legacy have been? What wonderful hybrid monsters in our midst would claim it as an ancestor?   201cOn the Silver Globe 201d is not rated. It is in Polish, with English subtitles. Running time: 2 hours 46 minutes.

            "input": "text:They process language differently According to a 2008 study of young learners at Northwestern University, girls and boys process language differently. The study revealed that, when learning language, girls 2019 brains show greater activity in the areas used for language encoding.  Boys 2019 brains, on the other hand, show activity in the areas associated with visual and aural functions. This means that while girls can process an abstract piece of language more efficiently, boys need some sensory reinforcement to process the data.  For males, the most effective way to study language is to learn visually (seeing a written word or illustration) as well as orally (through listening and repetition).  They use more study strategies According to the language journal Porta Linguarum, studies from Europe, East Asia, and Latin America have all concluded that female foreign language learners tend to use more varied study methods than their male peers.  Female learners engage more skills (speaking, reading, etc) and elements of language (vocabulary, pronunciation, etc), than males, who tend to stick with only a handful of study methods.  A variety of review methods and subjects helps language learners build their skills holistically while preventing boredom.  For learners who may be stuck in a rut, there 2019s no shortage of language study apps, workbooks, podcasts and websites, all targeting different skills.  They converse more Language learning site Busuu has reported that female users of the site are four times more likely to chat with native speakers of their target language.  This finding reinforces the popular notion among linguists that women are socially conditioned to build connections through talk, and are therefore more used to asking questions and propelling conversation.  Making connections with native speakers of a language helps learners practise listening and speaking skills, improve pronunciation, reinforce grammar and vocabulary, and pick up colloquialisms.  The social connections and friendships that can stem from conversation are also motivators in language study.  Of course, this is a very broad diagnosis of male and female habits, and there are certainly many timid females or sociable males who are exceptions to the rule.  For learners who are timid about face-to-face conversation, online forums (like Busuu) are a low-risk way to socialise.  They are more motivated in school According to the Canadian Journal of Applied Linguistics, girls tend to be more motivated to study languages than their male classmates. Studies in Canada, the UK, and Hungary all show that female students are more likely to continue their foreign language studies in school, even when the language class isn 2019t mandatory.  The rationale behind this pattern is highly disputed among linguists. Some theorise that both girls and boys perceive language study as a female domain.  Some claim that, since language teachers are typically women, girls in the classroom can connect to their instructor as a role model.  Again, these findings are broad trends with many individual exceptions. When it comes to language learning, particularly with adults, motivation can take many forms.

Here's how these planes break down in terms of availability.   2022 Fraser Nelson: Strikes in Syria are meaningless if we keep slashing our military  The Ministry of Defence can be coy about exact figures for security reasons, so figures like how many unmanned aerial  Reaper  drones there are rough estimates. However, some are already conducting strikes in Iraq and surveillance operations in Syria, so they're already proving their use.  Despite the number of Eurofighters available for use, and their capability for air-to-ground warfare, they wouldn't be quite as useful as the other types of aircraft.  Justin Bronk, a research analyst at RUSI, explains:  The Typhoon would be less flexible than the tornado because it can't use the brimstone missile, which is both extremely accurate and has low collateral.   If Britain started air strikes on Isil in Syria, Bronk suggests it would expand where its existing airplanes were operating - looking at Tornado aircraft and Reaper drones - rather than devoting scores of new aircraft.    It would be a huge change for the RAF at the moment to significantly uplift what they're doing in the region.   The figures show that Britain has around 126 Eurofighter Typhoons in operation, with 40 of those available to be called up swiftly. 32 of those are based in the UK for domestic defence, while 4 of them are patrolling the Falklands, and a further 4 helping Nato's air-policing mission over the three Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.  The Ministry of Defence has paid for 160 Typhoons in total, so it has yet to get its hands on estimated 40 more planes.  What about the numbers of Panavia Tornado aircraft? The figures suggest Britain has around 104 of these planes, which it first used to back in the 1991 Gulf War. Some of them are now based in Cyprus, being used to conduct strikes on Isil extremists in Iraq.  The Tornado fleet at RAF Marham, including those employed on operations overseas are organised in an aircraft pool from which air craft can be drawn, rather than permanently allotted to specific squadrons  If Britain decided to devote less manpower, it could use its fleet of Reaper drones to carry out air strikes on Isil in Syria. RUSI estimates we have around 12 of the drones, with 6 quickly availiable at any moment.  Here is a longer list of the RAF's range of airpower, as released by ministers in a parliamentary answer back in 2012 . Summary: Britain could carry out air strikes in Syria - but with what aircraft?",

            "input": "text:It is a stunning fact  2014 the biggest social revolution of our lifetime  2014 that far more women than men are now receiving what is in theory an elite academic education. When I was at university 20 years ago, the figures were almost exactly the other way round, with the ratio 60:40 in favour of males. Far more female graduates are coming out of our universities than male graduates  2014 and, in 30 years' time, when these people reach the peak of their careers, the entire management structure of Britain will have been transformed and feminised.  Speaking as an ardent feminist, I expect that this will have many wonderful results: a culture that is more feng shui and emotionally literate and altogether nicer, and an economy that benefits from unleashing the phenomenal energy and talents of British women who are  2014 if GCSEs, A-levels and university entrance results mean anything  2014 currently giving the male sex a good old intellectual thrashing.  Obviously a neanderthal corner of my heart worries about some aspects of the coming feminisation. Will we all become even more namby-pamby, elf-n-safety-conscious, regulation-prone and generally incapable of beating the Australians at anything than we already are? Hmm? And even if the feminist revolution is good and unstoppable (and it is both), we should perhaps consider some of the downsides  2014 and the most interesting is that greater equality between the sexes is actually leading to greater division between the classes. Here's how.  Since the emergence of our species, it has been a brutally sexist feature of romance that women on the whole  2014 and I stress on the whole  2014 will want to mate procreate with men who are either on a par with themselves, or their superior, in socio-economic and intellectual attainment. A recent study shows that if a man's IQ rises by 16 points, his chances of marrying increase by 35 per cent; if a woman's IQ rises by 16 points, her chances of getting hitched decline by the same amount.  Now look at those university entrance figures again, feed in that basic human prejudice, and some recent social phenomena become intelligible. If you have a sudden surge in the number of highly educated women  2014 more women than men  2014 then it is not surprising that you have a fair few Bridget Jones-type characters who are having a tough job finding Mr Darcy. It is a gloomy truth that 40 per cent of female graduates born in 1970 are likely to enter their forties childless.  As a result of the same instinct  2014 female desire to procreate with their intellectual equals  2014 the huge increase in female university enrolments is leading to a rise in what the sociologists call assortative mating. A snappier word for it is homogamy. The more middle-class graduates we create, the more they seem to settle down with other middle-class graduates, very largely because of the feminine romantic imperative already described. The result is that the expansion of university education has actually been accompanied by a decline in social mobility, and that is because these massive enrolments have been overwhelmingly middle-class.  It is one of the sad failures of this Government that relatively few bright children from poor backgrounds have been encouraged to go to university, partly because of weaknesses in primary and secondary education, partly because of the withdrawal of the ladder of opportunity provided by academic selection. Once they have failed to go to university, the boom in the number of middle-class female students only intensifies their disadvantages.  Let's put it bluntly: nice female middle-class graduates are either becoming permanent Bridget Joneses, or marrying nice male graduates, and they seem on the whole to be turning up their nice graduate noses at male non-graduates. And when the nice middle-class graduate couples get together, they have the double income to buy the houses and push the prices up  2014 and make life even tougher for the non-graduates.  The result is that we have widening social divisions, and two particularly miserable groups: the female graduates who think men are all useless because they can't find a graduate husband, and the male non-graduates who feel increasingly trampled on by the feminist revolution, and resentful of all these hoity-toity female graduates who won't give them the time of day.  What is the answer, my friends? I don't know. We could try fiscal incentives for heterogamy. We could have plotlines in soap operas, in which double first girls regularly marry illiterate brickies.  But the only long-term solution for the  uselessness  of young men, as complained of by my twentysomething colleagues, is to get serious with the education of males in primary schools. And if the Equal Opportunities Commission wants to say something sensible for a change, it should start campaigning for more male teachers. Summary: If the feminist revolution is good and unstoppable (and it is both), we should perhaps consider some of the downsides, muses Boris Johnson.",

            "input": "text:Portraits, from gritty Lucian Freuds to the fatuous kitsch perpetrated by street artists, are such a constant presence in our visual landscape that it's hard to remember that the genre's history is far from continuous. For centuries, throughout the ancient world 2014in Mesopotamia, Egypt and Greece 2014human beings were depicted according to strict, near-abstract conventions, except for a short-lived period of relative naturalism during the reign of the renegade monotheist pharaoh, Akhenaten. The Romans, of course, excelled at memorial portraits, sculpting heads uncannily like people we still encounter on present-day Italian streets and, in the further reaches of the Empire, painting those astonishing, liquid-eyed face-panels for Roman-era Egyptian mummies.  Medieval manuscripts sometimes include images of donors, but essentially as emblems of kingship or duchesshood rather than as reports on the particularities of recognizable persons. Aristocrats, in the Middle Ages, are depicted no more specifically than peasants performing labors appropriate to the seasons; they're just better dressed. It's not until the Renaissance that we again find representations as sharply characterized as those of ancient Rome, evidence not only of what the 19th-century Swiss cultural historian Jacob Burckhardt called  the revival of antiquity,  in his seminal work  The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy,  but also of, in Burckhardt's terms,  the development of the individual  and  the awakening of personality.   These new attitudes come to life in the delectable survey  The Renaissance Portrait: From Donatello to Bellini,  a collaboration between the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Gem 00e4ldegalerie, Berlin. More than 150 paintings, sculptures, reliefs and drawings trace the development of the likeness, mainly during the 15th century, from stylized profile images, inspired by antique medals, to three-quarter views of convincing personages who turn easily in space and coolly appraise us. It's a stunning show, with a checklist that reads like the iconic collection of an ideal museum of the quattrocento, plus compelling works by less familiar Italian artists and a few splendid Netherlandish portraits for comparison.  Organized both chronologically and thematically, the exhibition begins with a Donatello  speaking reliquary  (c. 1425): a gilded bronze bust designed to house a skull fragment of St. Rossore, the image denoting the type of relic enclosed. Somehow, Donatello transforms a traditional devotional form into a potent evocation of an individual, pointing the way to the vividly personal paintings and sculptures of demure women and powerful men in subsequent galleries.  The Donatello bust is accompanied by early quattrocento paintings of male profiles by Masaccio, Paolo Uccello and (probably) Domenico Veneziano, all of them with red cappucci 2014long-tailed hoods 2014piled on their heads. Despite their robust modeling, they seem schematic, as do many of the images of young blondes that follow, paintings by such masters as Filippo Lippi, Sandro Botticelli and the Pollaiuolo brothers, and suave marble busts by Desiderio da Settignano and Andrea del Verrocchio. So it's no surprise to learn that the men may be posthumous portraits, made as symbols as much as truthful likenesses, or that the women, with their elaborate hairstyles, opulent jewelry and piquant profiles, are better interpreted as idealized embodiments of modesty and chastity than as accurate records of particular people.  Yet as we move through the exhibition, we are increasingly surrounded by specific individuals with particular attributes. Portraits of the Medici and their associates announce what Burckhardt called  the modern idea of fame,  a concept further explored, later on, in medals, busts, drawings and paintings of assorted (mostly male) notables, from clerics to humanist poets to merchants. Some are corpulent and jowly, others are lean and bony, still others have impressive noses or stubborn chins; all have had their most distinctive features emphasized, as if to ensure immediate recognition or confirm relationships. We note, for example, the long, narrow d'Este face, captured by Pisanello in his portraits of Leonello, the marquess of Ferrara, in a Rogier van der Weyden portrait of Leonello's  natural son.  We see how the erudite, hard-bitten humanist-warrior-duke of Urbino, Federigo da Montefeltro, and his small, blond son Guidalbaldo share an overbite and a sturdy chin.  The Medici section includes multiple versions of Botticelli's commemorative portrait of Giuliano de' Medici, Lorenzo il Magnifico's brother, murdered in 1478 in the  Pazzi Conspiracy.  Supporters of the family commissioned images of the long-nosed, dark-haired young man with downcast eyes as signs of solidarity and loyalty. Lorenzo himself appears many times, in different mediums, most unforgettably in a fierce death mask. (The identification of the subject of a fresh little drawing by Leonardo da Vinci is disputed.)  We can learn a lot about the conventions and the development of Renaissance portraiture from this absorbing exhibition. We can compare drawings, sometimes made from life, with finished paintings or medallions. We can measure Benedetto da Maiano's preparatory terra-cotta bust of the tough-minded Florentine banker Filippo Strozzi against the finished marble version (both 1475). Mostly, we can revel in such superb works as Giovanni Bellini's 1515  Fra Teodoro of Urbino as St. Dominic,  a sympathetic portrait of an elderly ascetic, holding a lily, that prefigures the entire Pre-Raphaelite movement. There's Antonello da Messina's skeptical young man with thick curling hair and a black cappuccio (1478) and Laurana's nuanced marble of the introspective bluestocking Beatrice of Aragon (c. 1474-75). And much more. These glimpses into history, these interesting faces, gorgeous clothes and richly worked jewelry, come to us via incisive drawing, subtle modeling, glorious color and seductive surfaces. That's a lot.  Ms. Wilkin writes about art for the Journal. Summary: For centuries up until the Renaissance, portraits adhered to strict, near abstract conventions that smoothed over individual attributes.",

A flexible exchange rate, foreign reserves around $177 billion and a recently renewed flexible credit line with the International Monetary Fund leave Mexico relatively well positioned to manage external shocks, Moody 2019s added.  Moody 2019s rates Mexico A3, a notch higher than Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor 2019s, but changed the outlook to negative at the end of March after the slump in oil prices cut into government revenue and strained the finances of state oil company Petr 00f3leos Mexicanos.  Moody 2019s forecasts that the Mexican economy will expand 2.5% this year, and is now slightly more optimistic than the consensus which foresees 2.3% growth, according to the latest central-bank survey of private economists.   201cWhen we started the year at 2.5%, we looked conservative, 201d said Moody 2019s senior analyst Jaime Reusche.  201cWe 2019re maybe a bit higher now. We expect some kind of pickup in the manufacturing sector, while services could lose some momentum. 201d  Gross domestic product contracted 0.3% in the second quarter from the first, although output rose 2.4% from a year earlier, according to preliminary data from the National Statistics Institute.  Consumption has been the main driver, supported by wage and job growth, while manufacturing has lagged on sluggish external demand despite the weaker peso making Mexican exports cheaper.  Moody 2019s concern with slower growth is that it could limit the government 2019s ability to reduce fiscal deficits. In the case of Mexico, the benefits of government spending cuts to reduce borrowing slightly outweigh the negative impact on growth, Mr. Reusche said.  Fitch Ratings last week affirmed Mexico 2019s sovereign rating at triple-B-plus, citing the country 2019s diversified economic base and  201ctrack record of disciplined economic policies. 201d  Fitch expects the economy to grow 2.4% this year, speeding up to 3% on average in 2017 and 2018 thanks to a competitive peso, improved external conditions and some positive impact from recent overhauls such as the opening of the energy sector to private investment.

At an evening ceremony in the famed Maracana soccer stadium, Brazil will declare open the 31st Summer Olympic Games and the first ever in South America. They will run until Aug. 21.  Organizers are hoping the start of the Games will erase months of bad publicity for Rio - from polluted water to faulty plumbing at the athletes village to worries about the Zika virus - all against the backdrop of a brutal economic downturn.  SEE MORE: Everything you need to know about the Summer Olympics  Security challenges in the sprawling beachside city are at the forefront of many people's mind, not only because of Rio's decades-old reputation for violent street crime, but also after a spate of deadly attacks at big and small celebrations from Europe to the United States.  With many of the Games' 11,000 athletes and dozens of heads of state in attendance, the first major test of preparedness comes at Maracana, where the biggest security operation of the Games will be deployed.  Some 50,000 spectators are expected while more than 3 billion people tune in around the world as Brazil hosts its second major sporting event in two years, after the 2014 soccer World Cup.   I think it's going to be great,  said Braulio Ferreira,38, who runs a small shop in the Jardim Botanico neighborhood, near the lagoon where rowing and canoeing races will be held.  Like the World Cup, it'll be great to throw a good party and mix with the people from all over.   Like many in Rio, however, Ferreira said citizens had not received benefits like better transport and sanitation promised in the Olympic bid:  It cost a lot of money, but I don't see much of the legacy that was promised.   Brazil's political crisis could crash the party as interim President Michel Temer opens the Games. In a bitterly divided country, protesters are encouraging spectators to boo Temer, who took over after the Senate voted to subject leftist President Dilma Rousseff to an impeachment hearing this month.  Brazil won its bid for the Games back in 2009, when the economy was booming and Rio's coffers swelled with royalties from its offshore oil.  The economy is now on track for its worst recession in a century and Rousseff is expected to be permanently ousted this month.  In what organizers have called a low-tech ceremony constrained by the dire economy, Brazil will showcase its natural treasures and the cultural riches created by one of the world's most diverse nations.  Samba, Carnival and the famously fun Brazilian spirit are expected to play heavily into the three-hour ceremony, as will a call to save the planet from climate change.  One of the most anticipated moments will be seeing which famous Brazilian will light the Olympic cauldron. The odds-on favorite is soccer legend Pele.  Spokesmen for Pele said he had received the green light from his sponsors and doctor, but the 75-year-old was waiting to see if he felt well enough.  Before the ceremony, the Olympic torch will travel to some of the most well-known landmarks of the  marvelous city  - from the Christ the Redeemer statue atop the lush green mountains to the striking Pao de Acucar or Sugar Loaf rock formation on Guanabara Bay.

Mr Thompson said the plan - named Project Barcelona - would enable the purchase of programmes to own for a  relatively modest  fee.  He added that the digital archive would stay open for good, and shows would remain available to licence fee payers.  The plans will be put before the BBC Trust later this year.  Mr Thompson, who was speaking at the Royal Television Society (RTS) in London, said that the UK's producers would also need to give their support to the project.  He said that the BBC intended to open up a  digital shop  for programme downloads, but that other existing providers would also be able to buy the content.  Mr Thompson added that more and more programmes from the archive would be added to the service.  He described the scheme as the  digital equivalent  of people buying a DVD of their favourite programme for a permanent collection. Many of the programmes would not have previously been available to own.  The BBC's boss also said that the project would provide a source of income to support independent programme production in the UK, and denied it was a  second licence fee by stealth .  Media commentator Steve Hewlett said:  Other broadcasters could be concerned about the service's impact.   When it launched, iPlayer was extremely disruptive to emerging paid-for content models because it was free at the point of use. People will be asking whether Project Barcelona will have a similar effect on the market.   Mr Hewlett added:  The BBC's archive programmes - like Fawlty Towers and Doctor Who - already represent a significant commercial revenue stream in the form of DVDs and downloads on services like iTunes.   If it is going to open up the broader archive, then it would naturally expect people to pay for access.   Project Barcelona is viewed as another part of a strategy to give access to the BBC's programmes, which the corporation has been pursuing for the past decade.  It follows on from the iPlayer and YouView - a free-to-air, web-based service joining the BBC with other providers including Channel 4 and ITV.

From the roller coasters at Hershey Park to the butterfly conservatory at Hershey Gardens, Hershey, Pa., was literally built on the generosity of its founder, the iconic chocolatier Milton S. Hershey.  Seven decades after his death at the age of 88, the maker of Hershey 2019s Kisses and Reese 2019s Peanut Butter Cups still employs 4,500 people in a close-knit community surrounded by farmland. The related entertainment company draws 8,000 more full- and part-time workers into the town of 14,200 people.  No wonder, then, that Hershey residents fret the tap might run dry if Hershey Co. HSY 1.73 % is sold or merges with a suitor such as Mondelez International Inc., MDLZ 0.73 % the Oreo cookie maker that offered on June 30 to buy Hershey for $23 billion. Hershey 2019s board rejected the bid.   201cWho knows what happens to all that if the company is sold? That 2019s what worries people, 201d said Ken Rawley, who grew up in Hershey, where his father was a sales and marketing executive at the company. Mr. Rawley has since moved to New York and works for a boat company.  Hershey is a holdout from a bygone American era, when some 2,000 towns sprang up to serve one particular coal mine, textile factory or slaughterhouse. Many have faded as factories moved overseas and technological advancements led to job cuts.  The coal-mining town of Lynch. Ky., built by U.S. Steel X -0.56 % in 1917, saw its population start to plummet in the 1950s from a peak of 10,000 as the industry mechanized. As of the 2010 U.S. census, there were 747 people left in Lynch. Archer Daniels Midland Co. ADM 0.37 % recently left its longtime home of Decatur, Ill. for trendier pastures in Chicago, hurting fancier restaurants and hotels that catered to the commodities giant 2019s executives and white-collar visitors.  Belgium-based InBev BUD 0.43 % purchased Anheuser Busch in 2008. The beer giant had cut some 2,000 jobs in the St. Louis area 2014AB 2019s headquarters 2014by the end of 2011, and started a yearslong squabble over who would operate a beloved local nature reserve.

The same fate hasn 2019t befallen Hershey, where Kisses-shaped lamps burn bright above the downtown intersection of Chocolate and Cocoa Avenues.  201cHershey seems as prosperous and welcoming as ever, 201d said Hardy Green, author of  201cThe Company Town: The Industrial Edens and Satanic Mills That Shaped the American Economy. 201d He added,  201cPeople in the town of Hershey are reluctant to say anything bad about the company because they 2019re afraid of what will happen. 201d  Hershey 2019s resilience is due largely to the unusual strength of Hershey Trust Co., a secretive body of about 10 members that oversees a $12 billion endowment, charitable and entertainment institutions across Hershey, and 81% of the chocolate maker 2019s voting shares.  Milton Hershey founded the trust over a century ago, mainly to look after the Milton Hershey School for some 2,000 underprivileged children. It still does that, but today the trust also owns a resort and spa, an amusement park and a real-estate company in town.  The trust enjoys an unusual relationship with state leaders. Pennsylvania law requires the state 2019s attorney general to oversee the trust 2019s major investment decisions, including a possible sale. Democrat Josh Shapiro and Republican John Rafferty are running for the open state attorney-general seat, and Hershey has become a campaign issue.  201cI will vigorously protect Hershey 2019s continued success in Pennsylvania, 201d Mr. Shapiro said.  The latest offer from Mondelez, formerly Kraft Foods Inc., included concessions to call the combined company Hershey and make the town its chocolate headquarters. That hasn 2019t stifled concerns in Hershey that jobs would leave.  Mondelez told worried Britons that its acquisition of Cadbury in 2010 would preserve a local factory that had been slated for closure. After inking the deal, Mondelez closed the factory after all.  Hershey Co. has also disappointed its citizenry in the past. A few years ago, Hershey closed its original factory, built under smokestacks that still proclaim the company 2019s name, indicating to visitors that they 2019ve come upon  201cthe sweetest place on earth. 201d A more mechanized facility nearby employs 500 fewer people than the old plant.  John Foley, a Milton Hershey School alumnus who sits on the town 2019s board of supervisors, said despite downsizing, Hershey residents still see the company as their  201cgolden goose. 201d   201cThey should never sell it. Even if the headquarters stayed here, we 2019d lose our power, 201d he said.  Brad Reese, the grandson of the creator of Reese 2019s Peanut Butter Cups, which Hershey bought in 1963, spent his early years in what he calls  201cthis very insular town. 201d He swam in the pool at the Hershey-built community center, and drank milk from the Hershey-owned dairy.   201cIt 2019s a honey pot, 201d said Mr. Reese,  201cthe hand that feeds. 201d  Write to Annie Gasparro at annie.gasparro@wsj.com Summary: Hershey, Pa., runs on chocolate and has enjoyed many benefits over the years.

The students have occupied the top floor of the administration building at Callan Park since 2pm on Monday to protest Sydney University's plan to reduce the number of courses on offer and cut staff numbers by more than half.  The university also hopes to close the Callan Park campus in Sydney's inner west.  The students, who plan to stay barricaded inside until the university responds to their demands, have already developed a nifty way of getting supplies.   We have a bucket people keep sending stuff up with, like cookies, cake and pizza,  student and protest organiser Suzy Faiz told AAP on Tuesday.

Despite her light-hearted comments, Ms Faiz and the other students are determined to stay put until the university responds to their grievances.   Until they're willing to sit down and talk we're not leaving,  fellow organiser Dylan Griffiths told AAP.  Sydney University appears unmoved by the protest, saying it  supports students' right to protest peacefully but its plans for changes to the SCA will remain unchanged .  The proposed changes include staff cuts of up to 60 per cent, an end to ceramics, jewellery, and glass classes and studios, and the closure of the Callan Park campus, which is attended by about 700 students.  The announcement came just weeks after the university backed down on plans to merge its visual arts school with a rival campus following student and staff opposition.  Painting and sculpture lecturer Mikala Dwyer said the occupy movement had inspired her and other arts staff.

Residents of the hill town estimated that up to 10 people were still missing and emergency services said they had located three corpses in Amatrice's Hotel Roma, which, like much of the historic centre, was wrecked by Wednesday's quake.  Deputy Mayor Gianluca Carloni said his uncle's body had still not been recovered from the hotel, which was particularly busy at this time of year because of a food festival.  Museums across Italy donated proceeds from their ticket sales on Sunday to help the rebuilding effort, while top flight soccer teams held a minute's silence before their weekend matches out of respect for the victims.  Pope Francis led prayers for the dead in his weekly address in St Peter's Square in Rome, saying he wanted to go to the earthquake zone to bring comfort to the survivors.  Priests in the quake zone held their regular Sunday services in large tents.  Amatrice's municipal website said the town had 100 churches, but every one was damaged by the disaster and many would have to be demolished.  With aftershocks continuing to rattle the region, including a magnitude 4.4 quake centred on the nearby city of Ascoli Piceno, residents were still struggling to absorb the disaster.   It took me 20 years to get my house, and then, in just 10 seconds, it was gone, like so many others,  said Ascenzio Attenni, who lived in the hamlet of Sant'Angelo outside Amatrice, where eight people died.  Rescue operations in most of the area were halted two days ago, but teams were still combing Amatrice, which is 105 km east of Rome.  The fire service said it was trying to remove some of the fallen masonry at the Hotel Roma and create a safe path to retrieve the three bodies as soon as possible.  The Civil Protection Department lowered the official death toll on Sunday to 290 from a previously given 291.  Italy has promised to rebuild the shattered communities and has said it will learn from the mistakes following a similar earthquake in the nearby city of L'Aquila in 2009, where much of the centre is still out of bounds.

For all the complaints about Obamacare, hospitals don 2019t want to see it entirely dismantled. The law needs changes, industry executives say, but the kind of do-over Trump has promised is seen as costly and disruptive. Also high on the radar are fast-rising drug costs and a willingness to spend federal dollars to study public health threats like the Zika virus and Ebola, as well as gun violence research, which Congress has refused to fund.  Almost anyone in finance will tell you they feel aggrieved by the Dodd-Frank overhaul following the 2008 financial crisis. They see Clinton as likely to continue the Obama administration 2019s policies and think Trump is their best chance for rolling back regulations. Republicans also want to defang the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  The multibillion-dollar investors in big deals who backed Mitt Romney in the last election now are worried about Clinton eliminating the tax deductibility of interest on corporate debt. Trump, whose businesses carry considerable debt, would be less likely to get rid of this tax benefit.  Both Trump and Clinton have suggested doing away with the favorable tax treatment private equity and hedge fund firms get with their own earnings, called  201ccarried interest. 201d But there 2019s a feeling in the industry that Trump might back away from policies that private equity executives oppose.  Business leaders will be training a close eye on the economic policies and plans of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.  Turns out the free tuition platform championed by Bernie Sanders and largely adopted by Clinton may be popular with parents and students but not so much with this region 2019s private colleges and universities.  Specialists in the sector say too much money pouring into public colleges could have the unintended impact of crowding out students with lower incomes and test scores. On the other hand, Clinton has pledged to lower interest rates on student loans and increase grants, moves that would help students at private schools too.  The medical schools and research universities in Massachusetts want to see an increase in the $2.5 billion in federal research funds that come here annually, money that Clinton may be more willing to earmark than Trump.  For a crowd that used to steer clear of politics, tech and venture finance folks have been unusually vocal in opposing Trump 2019s immigration policies. In an arena that 2019s devoted to innovation and new ideas, limiting who can come into the country and stay here to work and start companies is highly unpopular.  A sector that 2019s under pressure to embrace women and racial diversity also sees little affinity with conservative social policies.  Clinton also has pledged to invest in digital infrastructure.  Top on their list is funding for the National Institutes of Health, to promote research and development at the region 2019s hospitals and universities. And unlike their cohorts in finance, this group perennially wants more funding for their regulator, the Food and Drug Administration, to get new drugs through the pipeline faster. Both of those efforts have historically been pushed by Democrats.  Clinton has appeared in campaign ads criticizing the pharmaceutical industry for the high cost of drugs. On the other hand, she says she 2019d support development of new drugs.  Another big concern is trade deals, and protecting drugs invented in the United States from being copied overseas.

            "input": "text:A composite image of the scroll. (Commons)  An extremely fragile, ancient Hebrew scroll has been digitally unwrapped for the first time, revealing the earliest copy ever found of an Old Testament Bible scripture, researchers said Wednesday.  Known as the En-Gedi scroll, it contains text from the Book of Leviticus, and dates at least to the third or fourth century, possibly earlier, according to the report in the journal Science Advances.  The deciphering of its contents is described in the journal as a  significant discovery in biblical archeology.   The scroll is not the oldest ever found -- that honor belongs to the biblical Dead Sea Scrolls which range from the third century BC to the second century of the common era (AD).  Radiocarbon analysis has shown that the En-Gedi scroll dates to the third or fourth century AD.  Some experts think it is older than that. An analysis of the handwriting style and the way the letters are drawn suggests it could be even older, dating to the second half of the first century or the beginning of the second century AD.  Its contents were long thought to be lost forever, because it was burned in a fire in the 6th century and was impossible to touch without dissolving into chunks of ash.  The scroll was found by archeologists in 1970 at En-Gedi, the site of a large, ancient Jewish community dating from the late eighth century BC.  Its fragments were preserved by the Israel Antiquities Authority for decades.   Each fragment's main structure, completely burned and crushed, had turned into chunks of charcoal that continued to disintegrate every time they were touched,  said the study.  The charred remains of scroll. (Israel Antiques Authority)  So researchers used advanced digital scanning tools to  virtually unwrap  the scroll and see its contents.  A micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) scan was able to pick up traces of metal in the ink.  Before the scroll was virtually unwrapped, experts believed the artifact may have been a Torah scroll.  But a look at the images showed it was the Book of Leviticus, from the third book of the Book of Moses.  This makes it the earliest Pentateuchal book -- relating to the first five books of the Jewish or Christian scriptures -- ever found.   We were amazed at the quality of the images,  said Michael Segal, head of the School of Philosophy and Religions at Hebrew University of Jerusalem.   Much of the text is as readable, or close to as readable as actual unharmed Dead Sea Scrolls or high resolution photographs of them.   The scroll shows 18 lines of text in each column, which were originally 35 lines long.  Like other ancient Hebrew scrolls, it contains only consonants and no vowels.  Symbols for vowels were not introduced in Hebrew until the 9th century.   We were immediately struck by the fact that in these passages, the En-Gedi Leviticus scroll is identical in all of its details both regarding its letter and section division to what we call the Masoretic text, the authoritative Jewish text until today,  said Segal.  The En-Gedi Leviticus scroll  is the most extensive and significant biblical text from antiquity that has come to light  since the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, he added.  Researchers hope the techniques developed to read it will be used on other scrolls, including some from the Dead Sea Scroll collection, which have remained undecipherable until now.   Damage and decay is the natural order of things, but you can see that sometimes you can absolutely pull a text back from the brink of loss, said co-author Brent Seales, professor and chairman in the department of computer science at the University of Kentucky.   The En-Gedi scroll is proof positive we can potentially recover whole texts from damaged material, not just a few letters or a speculative word,  said Seales.

That's what we're proud of,  he said.  So, for him to question that, that's disqualifying.   Trump's remarkable comments came just hours after his running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, said on CNN  that we'll certainly accept the outcome of this election .  Trump's daughter Ivanka, arguably his most influential adviser, also said earlier on Wednesday her father would  do the right thing  when she was asked if he would concede after a defeat.  The debate answer left his own team scrambling in the aftermath. Kellyanne Conway, his campaign manager, at first responded to questions about the comment by saying he  would accept the results because he'll win the election .   So, you know, absent widespread fraud and irregularities, then, we'll see,  Conway said.  What he's saying is we have to see what happens.   She later rejected the outcry over Trump's comment, saying it's  not fair  to suggest Trump is undermining the prospects of a peaceful transfer of power.   You've got to listen to everything he said,  she argued.   Al Gore did not accept the results of the elections and he said he would. He actually conceded to George W. Bush on election night in 2000 and then called and retracted his concession.   Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, another of Trump's top allies, said the Republican nominee had good reason to be suspicious about potential fraud.   There are indications of a lot of fraud around by the Clintons,  Giuliani said. Summary: Condemnation of Donald Trump's refusal to say whether he'll honour November's election result should he lose, has come from Republicans and Democrats alike.",

            "input": "text:A disagreement between two respected Canadian academics is raising some fundamental questions about when a disputed scientific issue has been studied long enough.  The debate centers on whether it 2019s still valid  2014 or even ethical  2014 to do research on products called nosodes, which are marketed as homeopathic  201cvaccines. 201d  Homeopathy is a controversial arm of complementary medicine. It is based on the belief that conditions can be cured or prevented by giving a person a substance that induces the same symptoms, but in highly diluted form. Though it has hordes of adherents, homeopathy is dismissed as quackery by traditional medicine.  Dr. Mark Loeb, an infectious diseases researcher at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, is seeking volunteers for a study that he thinks will show nosodes don 2019t activate an immune response and therefore cannot protect against diseases.  Tim Caulfield, a professor of health law and policy at the University of Alberta in Edmonton and a zealous debunker of quack science, argues there 2019s no need to run such a study. Science already knows the answer, said Caulfield, whose most recent book  2014 on the impact of celebrity culture on health  2014 is entitled,  201cIs Gwyneth Paltrow Wrong About Everything? 201d   201cIt is com-pleeeeeeeete scientific nonsense, 201d Caulfield said of homeopathy, drawing out the word for added emphasis.  201cThere is no need to study it . . . I don 2019t need to run a physics experiment to demonstrate that flying carpets don 2019t fly. 201d  The alternative medicine system, devised in the late 18th century in Germany, is based on two theories scientists insist simply cannot work. One is the notion that  201clike cures like 201d and the other is that diluting a substance actually increases its potency.  Even the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health  2014 the part of the National Institutes of Health expressly charged with researching alternative medicine  2014 appears skeptical about homeopathy.   201cA number of the key concepts of homeopathy are not consistent with fundamental concepts of chemistry and physics, 201d the center 2019s website notes.  201cFor example, it is not possible to explain in scientific terms how a remedy containing little or no active ingredient can have any effect. 201d  And yet Americans spent nearly $3 billion on homeopathic remedies and $170 million on visits to homeopaths in 2007, according to the National Health Interview Survey, a regular survey of the American public 2019s health conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics. The 2012 survey estimated that 5 million adults and 1 million children used homeopathy in the previous year.  In both the United States and Canada, homeopathic remedies are sold with the acceptance of the federal drug regulatory agencies.  In the US, manufacturers of homeopathic remedies are allowed to make health claims on their labels  2014 even though the Food and Drug Administration does not require them to submit proof that the products can meet those claims.  In Canada, homeopathic remedies are licensed as natural health products. After taking a great deal of criticism over its handling of the products, Health Canada changed its rules regarding nosodes last year, requiring makers of the products to make clear they are not vaccines, should not be viewed as alternatives to vaccination, and haven 2019t been proven to prevent infection. The new labeling rules went into effect in July.  Critics on both sides of the border think the regulatory agencies should go further. And Loeb is hoping to provide solid evidence to make that case.  His plan is to test whether nosodes activate the immune system to protect against the diseases they purport to fend off.  He and colleagues will randomly assign about 150 people aged 18 to 24 to one of three groups. One group will get fake nosodes plus the two booster vaccines people in this age group are supposed to get. The second will get fake nosodes and fake vaccines  2014 sterile saline solution. The third will get commercially sold nosodes and fake vaccinations.  That means researchers will be testing whether the immune system is stimulated by vaccines versus placebo versus nosodes.  The purpose of giving each group both vaccines and nosodes (real or fake) is to ensure no one knows who gets what while the study is underway. Randomized trials that are double-blinded  2014 neither recipients nor researchers know  2014 produce the best quality evidence.  The researchers will draw blood samples from the recipients before they receive their therapy and again three weeks later. They will be looking to see if volunteers produce increased levels of antibodies, T-cells, and B-cells  2014 key players in an immune response.   201cOf course our hypothesis will be that [nosodes] will be no different than placebo, 201d Loeb said.  But Caulfield argued that people who believe in homeopathy will not be dissuaded, even by a well-done study. Further, he said the fact that a reputable university is studying nosodes will add to their cachet among people who believe they work.   201cThe concern is that just by running the trial you are legitimizing it, 201d he said, pointing to the fact that someone on Twitter sent him a link to McMaster 2019s advertisement that it was looking for volunteers as proof homeopathy isn 2019t, as Caulfield had denounced it, bunk.  When he learned that Loeb  2014 who has a reputation for doing terrific research  2014 was leading the study, he reached out and the two men spoke.  Both described a civil conversation. But they didn 2019t change each others 2019 minds.   201cThis invites an interesting debate about how we  2014 the scientific community, the research community, the academic community  2014 should respond to pseudoscience, 201d Caulfield said afterward.   201cDo we legitimize it by doing research on it? Or do we  2014 as I think we should do  2014 speak in one voice, one clear voice, and say: This is scientific bunk. 201d  Further, Caulfield argued that conducting the study may be unethical. His rationale: Research ethics require that there is what 2019s known as equipoise  2014 scientific uncertainty  2014 if a question is to be studied. There is no scientific uncertainty about nosodes, he insisted.  Loeb said he could find no previous study looking at whether nosodes triggered an immune response. And his arguments satisfied McMaster 2019s Institutional Review Board, which approved the study.  Dr. Ross Upshur, an ethicist and a professor at the University of Toronto Dalla Lana School of Public Health, disagreed with Caulfield on the issue of the study 2019s ethics, but agreed that regardless of the outcome of the study, it would not change the thinking of people who believe nosodes work.  Would he have approved the study if he had been on the McMaster review board? Upshur, who has conducted research with both Loeb and Caulfield in the past, said he could argue both sides of this debate, but said if pressed to make a call, he probably would have argued that the study wasn 2019t worth doing.  Dr. Peter Palese, a renowned influenza researcher at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in Manhattan, also understands Caulfield 2019s concern. He calls homeopathy  201chogwash. 201d But Palese noted that Loeb conducts first-rate research, and there has been little of that done on homeopathy.   201cIf a guy like Mark Loeb does it, it is a service to the rest of us, 201d he said.

As soon as our own species stepped away from the teeming continuum of the surrounding world, we started talking to its variousness and began trying to deduce what other species might be saying. For more than 30,000 years, from the first known cave paintings of lions and wild horses, to the most recent  201csci-art 201d works featuring transgenic organisms, the multifarious histories of our attempted conversations with nature have had one thing in common. All describe our separation from it, and at the same time our attempts to bridge the gap. Our talking to the animals has mostly been one-sided, domineering at times, cloth-eared at others and frequently plain wrong, but it continues, richly reflecting our evolving beliefs about the 8.7m or so other species on Earth.  Orpheus had a similar project to Dr Doolittle. His singing in Ancient Greece was said to be so charming that animals and plants gathered to listen. But what happened next? The stilling of the wild was the thing; what the lion or the dandelion made of what they 2019d heard isn 2019t recorded. Nor could it be. If a lion could talk, Wittgenstein advised, we wouldn 2019t be able to understand it. The outward-facing openness of animals 2019 looks, as described by the Orpheus-infatuated poet Rilke (and taken up by Heidegger and others including John Berger in his Why Look at Animals?), is closed to us.  How, in the absence of any intelligible crosstalk, we have scientifically and imaginatively processed the planet 2019s other occupants is the concern of the Wellcome Collection 2019s exhibition Making Nature. The show 2019s curator, Honor Beddard (working with natural history consultant Jack Ashby), has brought together more than a hundred objects from literature, film, taxidermy and photography and organised them in four sections: Ordering (mostly about taxonomy and systematics from Linnaeus onwards), Displaying (about museums and collecting specimens), Observing (animals and their capture in zoos), and Making (about genetic manipulation, artificial selection and the unstoppable urge humans have to interfere with all levels of life).  Included here are world consciousness-altering enterprises, such as a first edition of Linnaeus 2019s whole Earth catalogue, the Systema Naturae, from 1735. But there are also telling jokes, such as the fake apeman that the maverick naturalist Charles Waterton assembled around 1825. Nearby are first-time groupings of specimens and artefacts: various remains of Count Raggi 2019s birds of paradise, with an intact body (a study skin) put alongside another with its feet and wings removed (looking like a flaming carrot, it perplexed early European curio-hunters who deduced the bird lived without touching the Earth); there are also the feathers of other birds fashioned around 1910 into a chic Parisian hat at the height of the plume boom, and other feathers from birds slaughtered on their home ground in the 19th century to make a headdress for a Torres Strait Islander. Here too are freshly incarnated dreams: a selection from the Pittsburgh Center for PostNatural History of various organisms that have been intentionally altered by humans, including dried and preserved E coli bacteria assembled in an acrylic block to spell out the words  201cHello World 201d.  In the biblical account of creation, the separation of humans from other animals needed to be asserted. Adam was given an Eden project of his own: the job of naming every beast of the field, every fowl of the air:  201cWhatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof. 201d  201cNaming the Animals 201d, a poem by Anthony Hecht, develops the story. Adam, new  2013 understandably  2013 to the game, is bewildered by his task. Shyly addressing a cow, he ventures to call it Fred.  Fred the cow and Adam 2019s efforts underline the paradoxical effect of naming nature. Organising the world with words, representations or manmade symbols brings wildlife closer to us. Differentiating every hummingbird in the Americas by a scientific and a common name raises each hectic blur of metallic colour into a humanly graspable object: the birds exist and now we know them to exist. To know that there are 340 species of hummingbirds, where once there were thought to be just 20, enlarges both our perception of biodiversity and our minds. But, as we discover quite how profuse life is, we also learn that each bundle of feathers most likely cares little for our taxonomical attentions. Naming gives us some purchase, but it also teaches that nothing in nature is for sale, that nothing beyond us  2013 animal, vegetable or mineral  2013 can be truly ours to have. We are having to learn to read over and over again as we discover more and more species; our naming, therefore, can only be a holding measure, the truth for now.  Naming gives us some purchase, but it also teaches that nothing beyond us  2013 animal, vegetable, mineral  2013 is ours to have  Look out of your window and think how every blackbird you might see is unaware it is a blackbird, not one tree cares whether it is an oak, an ash or a lime. And yet the blackbird lives as a blackbird, not as a blackcap; the ash is an ash and not an alder. We are right to tell the difference because the difference is telling. And this truth is imaginatively stimulating as well as intellectually invigorating. How much better to know that, instead of generic little brown things flying away from us, there are rock pipits and water pipits and tree pipits and meadow pipits. What a good day it was when Gilbert White 2019s repeated walks around his parish at Selborne in Hampshire in the 1770s prompted him to realise that there wasn 2019t just one but three kinds of leaf 2011green warblers among the spring leaves: chiffchaffs, willow warblers and wood warblers.  Careful-looking lies behind this enlarging of life. Our species has been doing this for a long time: one of the wonders of cave paintings is the accuracy of their depictions. We may not know whether the lions or the horses represent a shopping list, or a field note, or a frieze of totemic animals to inspire shamanic dreaming, but we can immediately recognise precisely what the creatures are. They are named in ochre. Such diligent attention to the real and translations from it have remained a human trait ever since, throughout art and science history. One of my favourite stories about Charles Darwin has his son asking another boy,  201cWhere does your father do his barnacles? 201d, assuming all dads were like his: organising geniuses intent on peering down microscopes and infatuated with life in all its forms.  Not everyone would agree. Some think naming is a quasi-colonial action, a possessive anthropo-something grab after other species; some think that attempts to organise life and to understand it lose sight of its deeper truth and dilute its organic magic. The early 19th-century poet John Clare was an extraordinary field naturalist. His poems and prose writings comprise a remarkable 65 first bird records for his home county of Northamptonshire. Their names brightly mark all of his writing but he was hostile to the idea of scientific study:  201cI love, 201d he wrote,  201cto see the nightingale in its hazel retreat and the cuckoo hiding in its solitude of oaken foliage and not to examine their carcasses in glass cases. 201d Another poet, William Blake, was furious with Isaac Newton for, as he put it, unweaving the rainbow.  Let me try to convince the doubters. In the last few years the DNA of the large gulls of the northern hemisphere has been scrutinised. What I grew up thinking were herring gulls and lesser black-backed gulls have been closely studied. These two species had populations all around the planet that more or less merged with one another in a continuous grey and white flight of feathers. Geographical races or subspecies were known, usually defined by having separate breeding colonies every thousand kilometres or so. But  201cherring gull 201d was what I 2019d call any bird like it that I saw in the Mediterranean, or the Black Sea, or off the west coast of Ireland, as well as on my local reservoir, where I 2019d been birdwatching since I was a child. It was the same for the lesser black-backed gull. Then suddenly  2013 for me at least  2013 the two species became about 10. The herring gull survives but what were previously thought of as subspecies have been promoted to species. There are new birds to twitch: Caspian gulls and yellow-legged gulls moving north and west from their breeding grounds, and American herring gulls and Azorean gulls displaced around the Atlantic.  The birds themselves haven 2019t changed. They are as they were before the ornithological journals published papers splitting the species apart. My eyes are the same, too  2013 straining through lenses and watering in cold winds and frosty dusks. But what is now known has changed everything: the gull world has got larger. There seems to be more life on the planet. That must be a good thing.  It is, of course, a question of terms. But, language being what our thinking lives by, these new terms have gone in deep. Taxonomy is an unfashionable discipline in the sciences today but should be valued as a key building block for understanding biological processes. All understanding of the species interactions on which life depends relies on knowing what a species is, even if the boundaries, as declared by us, are arbitrary, and nature doesn 2019t care where one species ends and another begins.  I said just now that it is my way of seeing that has changed, not the gulls themselves. But that isn 2019t quite true. Contemplating the findings and decisions of taxonomists and other organisers of the wild is a good way to keep fresh in our minds the fact that evolution is far from finished. The process did not come to an end when Darwin and those other bearded Victorians described it in the 19th century. Nothing is fixed in the world of the gulls of Britain, nor of any life on the planet. We are living our own evolution. It is as relentless as ever. And the extraordinary collection of texts and illustrations and artefacts and skins in Making Nature show how our single species has grown up  2013 enamoured and provoked, troubled and fascinated  2013 as we have tried to work out what on Earth is going on.   2022 Making Nature is at the Wellcome Collection from 1 December. wellcomecollection.org.

Abdul Rashid Dostum, phoned an urgent request to the U.S. general in charge of the air campaign. Gen. Dostum explained to his American counterpart, Maj. Gen. David Deptula, that a Taliban leader in the city had just called him to boast that he had put his headquarters in Gen. Dostum 2019s own house.  201cYou should bomb my house immediately, 201d Gen. Dostum said.  201cIt 2019s the only house within miles with a swimming pool and tennis court. 201d  In a few minutes 2019 time, Gen. Deptula obtained overhead imagery of the house and ordered a B-1 bomber to drop two precision-guided bombs on it. But then the staff at U.S. Central Command intervened, putting the strike on hold until it could verify the target. Geospatial intelligence personnel faxed a satellite photo of the house to Uzbekistan, from which the photo was flown by helicopter into Afghanistan, where a Special Forces soldier carried it on horseback to Gen. Dostum. By then, of course, the Taliban leader had left.  201cIf you want to bomb my house, go ahead, 201d Gen. Dostum informed Gen. Deptula.  201cBut there is no one there anymore. 201d  This episode is one of many in James Kitfield  2019s  201cTwilight Warriors 201d that will be new to observers of America 2019s wars against Islamic extremism. Mr. Kitfield, a veteran national-security reporter whose earlier book,  201cProdigal Soldiers 201d (1997), deftly narrated the U.S. military 2019s revitalization after Vietnam, here provides an enlightening tour of 21st-century counterterrorism 2014its successes and failures, its evolving technologies, and its ever-festering rivalries among national-security agencies. Along with voyaging through the Greater Middle East, he covers parts of Africa and Latin America, where U.S. agencies have combated terrorists and drug traffickers.  Unlike many such accounts,  201cTwilight Warriors 201d does not dwell on Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama or their cabinet officials. Rather it focuses on the leaders at the next level down 2014those who prosecuted the wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and other distant lands. Some of these individuals, like Gens. David Petraeus and Stanley McChrystal, are nearly household names, owing to their battlefield accomplishments. Two who are less familiar 2014Gen. Martin Dempsey and Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn  2014are presented more fully than before through Mr. Kitfield 2019s expansive interviews. Both are shown to be leaders who routinely overcame bureaucratic parochialism and hidebound thinking.  The figure who is least known to the public is Brian McCauley, whose agency 2014the FBI, where he rose to become deputy assistant director 2014has played the least-heralded role in overseas counterterrorism operations. Few Americans, indeed, had ever heard of Mr. McCauley until two weeks ago, when news organizations publicized his assertion that he had rebuffed a State Department request to reclassify a Benghazi email so that it was  201cnever to be seen again. 201d  Mr. Kitfield traces FBI counterterrorism from the late 1990s, a period when the FBI and CIA strenuously resisted cooperation.  201cWhenever the two agencies were forced to work together . . . , 201d Mr. Kitfield says,  201cCIA and FBI agents clashed openly and often, with the former playing to type as tweedy Georgetown intellectuals, and the FBI agents coming across as blue-collar beat cops. 201d Even after 9 11 the tensions remained. The FBI sent its expert interrogators to question terrorist suspects who had been detained abroad, but they were elbowed aside by the CIA, which insisted on  201cenhanced interrogation techniques 201d that the FBI judged to be ineffective.  Mr. Kitfield explains how Mr. McCauley cultivated personal contacts at his foreign postings to break down barriers between agencies. He expanded the FBI presence in Afghanistan from a handful of agents to more than 100 to track down insurgent suicide-bomb cells. By demonstrating the value of the FBI 2019s technologies and techniques, he persuaded skeptical Special Forces soldiers to lend a hand with security.  While  201cTwilight Warriors 201d is filled with success stories, it also illuminates shortcomings and setbacks. In one instance, Mr. McCauley looked into a senior Afghan official after noticing that he was reaching the site of every terrorist bombing before anyone else. Mr. McCauley learned that the man controlled the ramp at Kabul airport, where opium was exported and that he was meeting with Pakistani intelligence figures. But the FBI never gathered enough information to bring charges against him.  Other failures were self-inflicted. The Obama administration chose to rely on surgical strikes against enemy leaders as its principal counterterrorism tool despite opposition from top experts.  201cIn the wrong circumstances targeted killings were like a narcotic, 201d Mr. Kitfield writes, summarizing Gen. McChrystal 2019s views,  201clulling decision makers into a false sense of accomplishment where showy gestures were confused with solving root problems. 201d  According to Mr. Kitfield, veteran counterterrorist officials concluded in 2012 that the Obama administration was seeking to suppress intelligence on Islamic extremist threats in order to justify walking away from Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and other countries that had fallen apart on his watch. Several senior intelligence officials, he reveals, objected vociferously when the National Intelligence Council drafted an estimate asserting that al Qaeda no longer posed a threat to the United States. The uproar compelled the council to withdraw the assertion.  Many of these officials have since moved out of government. From the sidelines, they have watched the Obama administration 2019s retrenchment from international affairs with sorrow and dismay.  201cThe brotherhood of soldiers, spies, and special agents, 201d writes Mr. Kitfield, has come to realize that  201cthe administration had confused walking away from a fight with ending one. 201d  Mr. Moyar is director of the Center for Military and Diplomatic History at the Foreign Policy Initiative.

            "input": "text:Donald Trump was supposed to take over the Republican Party, but the question going forward will be whether the Republican Party takes over him.  So far, the early legislative agenda of Republicans after the Trump revolution is shaping up to be exactly what you would 2019ve expected prior to the Trump revolution. It 2019s a cookie-cutter GOP program that any Republican who ran for president in the past 40 years would feel comfortable signing, with its prospective centerpiece another round of across-the-board tax cuts.  It 2019s not that Trump didn 2019t campaign on all of this over the past year. His candidacy combined utterly conventional Republican positions with a few signature policy heterodoxies and a flame-throwing populist message. If it 2019s comforting that he doesn 2019t seem intent on going to war with his own party in Washington, the opposite risk is that he loses some of his political distinctiveness in the grinding legislative wars to come.  This is why the Democratic approach to Trump so far, besides being insane, is wrongheaded. The Democrats are preparing to fight what they consider a kleptocratic handmaiden of Vladimir Putin in the Oval Office, an unprecedented threat to the American republic that justifies cockamamie schemes like calling for the Electoral College to ignore the results of the election.  There is no doubt that Trump is unlike any prior president. But if Democrats begin thinking and acting a little more rationally, they will in all likelihood find their opposition to Trump running in a reassuringly familiar rut  2014 Republicans are heartless tools of corporations and the wealthy. They don 2019t care if people lose their health insurance. They are cutting taxes for the rich. They are deregulating bankers. Etc., etc.  This is the critique that Hillary Clinton didn 2019t make of Trump, opting instead to emphasize his outlandishness and try to separate him from his party. In this vein, liberals are now resisting  201cnormalizing 201d Trump, when they should be perfectly content to normalize him  2014 specifically, to make him a normal Republican.  It 2019s possible to see the case already building. The candidate who issued thunderous jeremiads during the final weeks of the campaign against a globalized elite that had literally stolen from small-town America has assembled a cabinet that by and large could have been put together by Ted Cruz  2014 or, for that matter, Mitt Romney.  Then there 2019s the congressional agenda. The early indications are that Republicans will pass a partial repeal of ObamaCare out of the gate that could further destabilize the law 2019s rickety exchanges and lead to people losing their insurance.  Congressional Republicans tell themselves that they can blame the misconceived law itself for any negative fallout, but this will be a hard sell. For the first time in the course of the long ObamaCare debate, they will be the ones responsible for disruption in the health care market.  Next, congressional Republicans want to move on to large-scale tax reform. The starting point will likely be House Speaker Paul Ryan 2019s already well-developed plan for across-the-board income tax cuts and a lower corporate tax rate. For all its merit, Ryan 2019s reform could 2019ve been incubated by any conservative think tank before anyone imagined Trump might run for president, let alone win.  What 2019s the point in having a populist Republican in the White House if congressional Republicans can 2019t find a way to couple some replacement measures with their ObamaCare repeal to give people other options for getting health insurance?  Trump actually talked of  201ctaking care of everybody 201d when he was asked about health care during the campaign. That will be thrown back at him like President Obama 2019s promise that you can keep your plan if you like your plan.  Or if congressional Republicans can 2019t make their tax plan more oriented toward the middle class, perhaps including a cut in payroll taxes?  All of this is subject to change, and Trump can potentially blow up the best-laid plans of congressional Republicans with one tweet or a swipe in a TV interview or at a rally. Of course, Trump will be heard from on infrastructure, trade and immigration, where he is in a different place than much of his party.  Neither wing of the GOP may like it, but the Reaganites and the populists are now in an uneasy alliance. It behooves the champions of a highly traditional Republican platform to think about what Trump 2019s victory means and to be more mindful than in the past of the interests of working-class voters.  And it behooves Trump the firebrand to consider the responsibilities of governing (as he has by, for instance, jettisoning the crowd-pleasing call to lock up Clinton).  There is a balance to be struck. The Republican establishment may welcome a more  201cnormal 201d Trump, but so, in the end, will Democrats. Summary: Donald Trump was supposed to take over the Republican Party, but the question going forward will be whether the Republican Party takes over him. So far, the early legislative agenda of Republicans  2026",

Dyn, whose customers include some of the world 2019s most widely visited websites, said it did not know who was responsible for the outages that began in the Eastern United States, and then spread to other parts of the country and overseas.  The outages were intermittent, making it difficult to identify all the victims. But technology news site Gizmodo named some five dozen sites that were affected by the attack. They included CNN, HBO Now, Mashable, the New York Times, People.com, the Wall Street Journal and Yelp.  Dyn said attacks were coming from tens of millions of internet-connected devices  2014 such as webcams, printers and thermostats  2014 infected with malicious software that turns them into  201cbots 201d that can be used in massive distributed denial of service attacks.  The US Department of Homeland Security last week issued a warning about this powerful new approach, noting it was concerned about the potential for new attacks after code for malware used in these attacks was published on the internet.  Dyn said late Friday that it was fighting the third major wave of attacks, which were being launched from locations spread across the globe, making them harder to fight.   201cThe complexity of the attacks is what 2019s making it very challenging for us, 201d said Dyn 2019s chief strategy officer, Kyle York.  The US Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation said they were investigating.  The disruptions come at a time of unprecedented fears about the cyberthreat in the United States, where hackers have breached political organizations and election agencies.  Dyn said it had resolved one morning attack, which disrupted operations for about two hours, but disclosed a second a few hours later that was causing further disruptions.  Dyn said early Friday that the outage was limited to the Eastern United States. Amazon later reported that the issue was affecting users in Western Europe. Twitter and some news sites could not be accessed by some users in London late Friday.  PayPal Holdings Inc. said that the outage prevented some customers in  201ccertain regions 201d from making payments. It apologized to customers for the inconvenience and said its networks had not been hacked.  Amazon Inc. 2019s web services division, one of the world 2019s biggest cloud computing companies, also reported a related outage, which it said was resolved early Friday afternoon.  Dyn is a Manchester, New Hampshire-based provider of services for managing domain name servers (DNS), which act as switchboards connecting internet traffic. Requests to access sites are transmitted through DNS servers that direct them to computers that host websites.  Dyn said it was still trying to determine how the attack led to the outage but that its first priority was restoring service.  Attacking a large DNS provider can create massive disruptions because such firms are responsible for forwarding large volumes of internet traffic.

            "input": "text:Monday, October 7th 1996, 2:01AM  LIA WILLIAMS MUST HAVE THE CLEANEST hair on Broadway since Mary Martin in  South Pacific.  Every night in  Skylight  twice on matinee days she takes a bath and washes her hair.  Not onstage, however. The tub is not in the part of her London flat that's seen in the play, but when the doorbell rings and she answers it, she's just come from it, dressed in a robe with a towel covering her wet head.   It's a proper bath all right,  the long-haired, blond Brit explained.  All plumbed in and all. And I have to strip down and get my hair all wet. Do it fast, too, so I can make the next scene.   She's making more than a splash in a bathtub these days.  Skylight,  which arrived last month at the Royale Theater, is one of the hottest tickets around and it's not even one of those glitzy musicals. It's funny and it's sad and provocative, a story of two quite different people who once were lovers, trying to rekindle the flame after being apart for three years. And Williams, making her Broadway debut, was unanimously praised by the critics. Both she and Gambon know these roles well by now they were in the show in London for 12 weeks.  Her  Skylight  co-star is the formidable English actor Michael Gambon. He has a long and impressive list of credits on the British stage, as does Williams, but this play, by David Hare, is the first time for both of them on Broadway.  His reputation, however, is considerably longer than hers he had the leading role in the BBC production of  The Singing Detective,  which was a big success on public television. So, was she intimidated taking a role in which she has to hold her own against him?   Intimidated?  she answered.  How about terrified? He was my hero. He gave the most fantastic performance in a play called 'Man of the Moment.' It was absolutely brilliant. I remember the first day I walked into the rehearsal room, all I could see was this little person huddled inside a cloud of smoke.   Then the little person stood up and up and up and a hand reached out from the cloud and a voice said, 'Pleased to meet you.' From then on, we got along fine. The play is scary you feel like you're walking on razor blades. It has to be the biggest test of raw nerves that either of us had ever experienced.    You know, this is my first time ever being in the United States, first time ever being in New York, and I'm loving it. But then, my greatest wish has always been to appear on Broadway. Doing this play is a dream-wish fulfillment.   Her 6-year-old son, Joshua, loves New York, too. Particularly on Saturdays when, during matinee performances, he gets to play with Patti LuPone's son. LuPone is next door to Williams in  Master Class.    I wouldn't mind staying in this city, but I would have to think about Joshua's schooling,  says Williams.  It's a big city, and I thought I'd be homesick, but I did feel instantly at home here. It's a wonderful place; the energy is so exciting. I've never experienced anything like it.

            "input": "text:BY GEORGE RUSH AND JOANNA MOLLOY with Baird Jones  Friday, February 14th 1997, 2:01AM  James Brown ought to be singing  I Feel Bad  today. The so-called Godfather of Soul was AWOL Tuesday night for the Muhammad Ali benefit for starving refugees in Zaire at which B.B. King, the Fugees, Zelma Davis, and rappers Busta Rhymes and Q-Tip performed to a packed Radio City house for free.  A source associated with the event, where Oscar-nominated producers Leon Gast and David Sonenberg premiered the documentary  When We Were Kings,  told The News that Brown demanded $50,000 for hotel and transportation for him and his ba nd alone.   He demanded a presidential suite with two marble bathrooms, and a white or black Lincoln or Cadillac limousine, 1995 or better,  said the source.  Brown also demanded a $12,500 fee to sing just one song  Funky Good Time  while all the other performers waived their fees. The event's organizers reluctantly agreed to some of Brown's demands, and his manager, Lisa Ross, signed a contract, and the performer's name was used in all the advertising.  But six days before showtime, says a source, Brown contacted producer Scot McCracken and demanded to be paid $75,0, a source claims.   B.B. King, he canceled a paying gig in San Diego to come,  said the source.  He's in his 70s, and he drove two hours to some dinky airport and changed planes to get here by 10 p.m. the night before. Then he rehearsed till 1:30 a.m.   Brown's spokesman, Larry Friday, claimed,  He was not contracted to perform or appear.   It's not known whether Ali was offended, but Brown had better do a reality check. Not one ticket-buyer complained to Radio City about his absence.  Christopher Reeve continues to amaze. When the disabled actor was met by a subdued audience Wednesday at a sneak-peek of his wrenching new HBO NYC movie, which airs in April, no one spoke for an awkward minute. So Reeve started cracking jokes.   When I used to do the `Superman' movies, I used to get into everything, checking out the lighting, the sound, the editing,  Reeve said.  Recently I told the producer that I was directing now. He said, `So what else is new? '   In the Gloaming,  Reeve's directorial debut with Glenn Close, Whoopi Goldberg, Robert Sean Leonard, Bridget Fonda and David Strathairn, is a story of a young man with AIDS coming home to his wealthy but unhappy parents, and the emotional healing that happens among them. In an inspired move, HBO's Colin Callender and producer Fred Zollo asked Reeve to lens the flick, based on Alice Elliott Dark's story in The New Yorker. But there were adjustments to be made.   The sound of my vent would ruin the soundtrack,  said Reeve.  So I stayed in a different room with a two-way speaker. There was a video assist on my viewfinder, and I can see the shots and adjust them as they're being shot. It's amazing. I think one day Steven Spielberg will stay at his house in East Hampton and direct actors in California.   The process was not without its frustrations, Reeve allowed.  There was a scene where I wanted Glenn and Robert to sit on a bench a certain way. It took me 20 minutes to explain it. If I could've stood up, I could've shown them in one minute.   But there are pluses for actors, too, not the least of which is that Reeve, an actor, respects their craft.  And I'm not in a position to storm around and rant and rave and carry on,  said Reeve.  That energy level makes for a relaxed set.  Speaking of Leonard's character, Reeve said,  This man already knows he's not going to live. I said to him, `The key thing is acceptance. This character is somebody you really respect and somebody you really admire for his courage. '  The amplified sound of Reeve's breathing apparatus filled the room. He could have been talking about himself.  Mick Jagger is said to be trying to talk his fellow Rolling Stones into offering stock in the group. Jagger, who went to the London School of Economics, was obviously impressed by the $55 million that David Bowie's bond offering raked in last week ...

Viewers have reached out to help, from left, Courtney, Shawn and Erica, three children featured in Diane Sawyer's special,  A Hidden America: Children of the Mountains.   CLICK HERE for the complete list of charities and CLICK HERE to watch the full show.  Shawn, the 18-year-old football player from Flat Gap, Ky., who believed he had to move away from home to keep his dreams on track, received scholarship offers from three local universities. He's chosen the respected Union College, the school he has always wanted to attend. His dorm room is ready, and he starts classes on Monday. He's also received several employment offers, ranging from coal mining to a position at UPS to a management training job at a supermarket in New York. He says it's an amazing second chance at his dreams and  an opportunity to go for it.    A lot of people are trying to help me right now, and I really appreciate everything everyone is trying to do for me,  he said.  I want to tell everyone who has helped me and responded to this thank you, and I hope they can help anyone else that is in my position.   Jeremy,19, who was shoveling coal six days a week and will soon become a father of two, received a surprise from a viewer.   They're giving us a baby shower and we really appreciate it,  he said.  Eleven-year-old Erica's mother Mona, who has struggled with drug abuse, said the ABC News report was a wake-up call, and she hopes to find work soon. A local tutor stepped in to help Erica with her studies, and an education fund has been established for her by the UNITE Foundation, an anti-drug organization whose founder became a mentor to Erica. Neighbors have also volunteered to help Erica's family repair the fire damage to their Cumberland, Ky., home.  A viewer drove all the way from Nashville, Tenn., to Inez, Ky., to see 12-year-old Courtney and donate clothes to her family. And a California family is sending her the Hannah Montana boots she wants so much. Courtney's mother Angel, who lost all her teeth, received a surprise from Dr. Edwin Smith, who will give her a new set of teeth for free.   I've waited a long long time for this,  Angel said.  It's almost real now.   Smith has received donations for his mobile dental clinic, and PepsiCo has reached out to Smith to work with him on dental health initiatives and to provide a second van for his work.  Kentucky's leaders are hopeful that the stimulus bill signed this week will bring help to their region.  We're getting money to build roads and bridges,  said Gov. Steve Beshear.  And part of that's gonna be done in eastern Kentucky. There's money in there for water and sewer projects. And, that's in demand in eastern Kentucky.   Lawyer and community leader Steve Cawood said that the stimulus money for train improvements is ideal for the skills of the mountain residents.   We have hundreds and hundreds of men and women who could be the welders, be the mechanics, be the tradesmen that could build that equipment,  he said.  Many spoke about green jobs to replace the options of Wal-Mart, fast food and the drug trade, and also about helping to get computers for kids in rural communities.  Eighty-one-year-old Eula Hall, who's been driving the sick out of the hills and into her clinic for 36 years, said, I wish there was a clinic like ours in every county in Appalachia so the people would get the kind of heath care they need and deserve.   Most of all, Kentuckians said that the beauty of the Appalachian mountains should call on everyone to restart a conversation about a region in crisis that began more than 40 years ago.   I think many times some of us turn a blind eye to the things that are painful,  said Neil Middleton, the vice president of news at Kentucky television station WYMT.  Truth hurts sometimes.    There are ways to think about the future in the mountains, in different kinds of ways than we've thought about it in the past,  said Ron Eller, the author of  Uneven Ground: Appalachia since 1945.   We just need to be willing to dream.   A number of viewers expressed interest in contacting the children featured during the show. We cannot provide the families' personal information, but ABC News encourages anyone who wants to help the children in the story to go through the Christian Appalachian Project (CAP), which is in contact with the families and has set up special funds for each child. This includes a college fund for Shawn. CAP can also collect items such as clothing, food and toys for delivery to the families.

This article is adapted from the book. By Kim Chernin  The locker room of the tennis club. A tall woman enters, removes her towel; she throws it across a bench, faces herself squarely in the m irror, climbs on the scale, looks down.  ''I knew it,'' she mutters. ''Up or down?'' I ask, hoping to suggest that there might be lands and cultures where gaining weight would not be considered a disaster. ''Two pounds,'' she says, ignoring the suggestion. ''Two pounds!'' Then she turns, grabs the towel and swings out at the mirror, smashing it violently, the towel splattering water over the glass. ''Fat pig!'' she shouts at her image in the mirror. ''You fat, fat pig!''  The Harvard Medical School Health Letter estimates that some 20 million Americans are on a ''serious'' diet at any given moment. According to the sociologist Natalie Allon, these dieters are spending $10 billion dollars a year in the process, much of it at hundreds of spas and health farms that charge from $185 to $3,000 a week. Diet books enrich their authors - ''Never-Say-Diet Book,''for example, out just a year, has spent 35 weeks of that time on the best-seller list and sold 560,000 copies.  Two facts make the current obsession with weight extraordinary. One is the scope of it. Throughout history, there have been dieters, including Roman matrons, who were willing to starve themselves. But there has never been a period when such large numbers of people have spent so much time, money and emotional energy on their weight. Weight Watchers, for example, holds more than l2,000 individual classes every week and has enrolled 13 million members since its founding in 1963.  The other extraordinary aspect of today's diet phenomenon is the degree to which it is focused on women. The nation has its share of fat men, of course, and many American men seek to lose excess weight. But interviews with physicians and psychologists make it clear that the truly obsessive dieter is almost inevitably female. Representatives of diet organizations acknowledge that 95 percent of their members are women. According to Dr. Hilde Bruch, professor emeritus of psychiatry at Houston's Baylor College of Medicine and an expert on eating disorders, more than 90 percent of those suffering from anorexia nervosa, an personality disorder that leads to self-starvation, are female. Bulimia, a condition in which periods of heavy eating are followed by self-induced vomiting, is almost entirely limited to women.  Why? Why have so many millions of American women, over the last decade, become so concerned about their weight? The subject has not received much attention, except on a superficial level. It deserves better.  There is, for example, the medical explanation: Women diet because of the long-proclaimed correlation between obesity and ill health. Yet that fails to cover the intense upset many women experience because of two or three pounds of overweight. And in any event, medical opinion has changed dramatically in recent years. Dr. Reubin Andres, clinical director of Baltimore's National Institute on Aging, has found, for example, based on his review of 40 worldwide studies involving six million people, that ''there's something about being moderately overweight that's good for you.''  The psychological explanation tends to be shallow, to trivialize the problem, as though women go on periodic binges of eating and dieting simply to relieve the standard frustrations and unhappinesses of their lives. ''Food is so fundamental,'' writes James Hillman, former director of studies at the C.G. Jung Institute of Zurich, ''that it is astounding to realize the neglect of food and eating in depth psychology.''  Even more astounding, perhaps, is the neglect of the modern woman's obsession with weight by today's feminist leaders - this despite the fact that the weight-watching movement and the women's liberation movement both developed during the l960's. Indeed, in my view, this obsession involves some of the most fundamental questions feminists themselves have raised - core issues of women's identity, of the child's relationship to the mother, of the society's response to women's claims for power.

            "input": "text:Feb 22nd 2012, 18:36 by J.L. , NAIROBI  ON TUESDAY night, when the news broke that Kenya's environment minister, John Michuki, had passed away in the Aga Khan hospital in Nairobi, Kenyans reacted with sorrow. Here was a big man who had actually done something for them. It was true, in a way. Mr Michuki served his country from before its independence and throughout his sickness. Those who worked with the 80-year-old politician on environmental issues were amazed at his energy and ferocity. Mr Michuki set out to save the Nairobi river from the sludge of human waste and to preserve the Mau forest for future Kenyans. As transport minister took on the anarchic minibus industry. He forced minibuses to use speed regulators, and the so-called Michuki rules 2014proper seats and seat belts 2014saved many lives.  But as the country's internal security minister, his hands were covered in blood. He was implicated in mass extrajudicial killings in 2007, in which hundreds of young Kenyan men were shot in the back of the head or bludgeoned to death for their alleged involvement in the Mungiki organised crime gang. And in 2006 Mr Michuki made a fool of himself by bringing to Kenya a pair of Armenian gangsters to shut down newspapers and television critical of the government. Since then, the country's media have operated more or less freely.  To many Mr Michuki was a bridge to an older Africa. The space between tribal traditions and the palatial Windsor Golf Club, which Mr Michuki built at the north end of Nairobi, can be measured in his life span. He was born in 1932 into a large polygamous Kikuyu family. Orphaned as a child, Mr Michuki left his rural home for Nairobi. He found work in a uniform shop sewing on buttons before battling his way through primary and secondary school. He was loyal to the crown in its bloody hammering of the Mau Mau insurgency. Choosing the British over his countrymen set him at odds with the founding myth of Kenya, but Mr Michuki was too intelligent and  no nonsense  to let it hinder his career. He won a scholarship to Oxford, and became a district commissioner. He was put in charge of newly independent Kenya's treasury. He ran the Kenya Commercial Bank and got involved in politics. Like the then attorney-general, Charles Njonjo, Mr Michuki had an Anglophile sense of things  being done properly.   To Mr Michuku, that meant keeping his buttons polished and being on time, but it did not mean transparency. He was part of the cabal of Kikuyu and Meru politicians, intelligence officers and businessmen who ran a state within a state and turned a blind eye to dodgy land and business dealings. President Mwai Kibaki yesterday called Mr Michuki a  true family friend and a dependable ally.  The shame was that his acuity and vigour were not more often put at the service of the common man. Historians will study his legacy, but Baobab readers can weigh in immediately. Summary: ON TUESDAY night, when the news broke that Kenya's environment minister, 00a0John Michuki, had passed away in the Aga Khan hospital in Nairobi, Kenyans reacted with sorrow.",

It's the first time since 1977 that has happened and the 11th time since Columbia University began the prestigious awards in 1917.  Manning Marable, who died last April, just as his 'Malcolm X' biography was about to be published, is the Pulitzer winner for non-fiction.  Manning Marable, who died last April, just as his 'Malcolm X' biography was about to be published, is the Pulitzer winner for non-fiction.  Don't blame the three-person fiction jury: novelist Michael Cunningham and critics Maureen Corrigan and Susan Larson.  After reading 341 books, they nominated three titles to the 18 voting members of the Pulitzer board, which  could not determine a winner,  says Pulitzer Prize administrator Sig Gissler, who sits on the board. Its members include prominent journalists such as TheNew York Times' Thomas Friedman. Its only fiction writer is novelist Junot Diaz.   None of the three books could get a majority of votes,  Gissler says.   2022Train Dreams by Denis Johnson, a novella set in the old American West.   2022Swamplandia! by Karen Russell, a debut novel set in the Florida Everglades about a failing theme park.   2022The Pale King by the late David Foster Wallace.

            "input": "text:Here are highlights of some of the city's newest and nicest playgrounds. Bring the fogscreen and don't forget the goldfish.  Where: Diamond Heights Boulevard at Digby Street.  Who's there: Noe Valley and Glen Park kids and moms; weekend dads; teens with hoop dreams; Diamond Heights dog owners.  Description: With separate play structures for younger and older kids and showstopping skyline views, the renovated Walter Haas has caused many a Douglass Park and Day Street loyalist to jump ship.  Best features: The varied-level climbing poles, the waterplay sand area and an undulating bicycle path that's great for beginning riders.  Downside: No bathrooms; slippery drifting sand on the rubber mats.  Bonus points: Showstopping views of downtown and the bay.  Where: Hoff Street between 16th and 17th streets.  Who's there: Families with young children from the Mission District.  Description: This new (2004) pocket playground was the result of months of lobbying by neighborhood children to turn a rundown parking lot into a kid-friendly space, and its name is a testament to their perseverance. Tucked into a sunny little alleyway in the heart of the Mission and enclosed by wrought-iron gates, it features a large fountain surrounded by wooden tables and benches, and arbors festooned with fanciful sculptural flowers. On one side, a brightly painted structure has cargo nets and baby teeter-totters; on the other side, there's a giant spiderweb climbing dome. Both sides have wall-to-wall soft flooring.  Best feature:  Our Children,  a soaring three-story mosaic-mural by Josef Norris that flanks the south side of the park.  Downside: No bathrooms. No sand feature.  Bonus points: You can park across the street in a secure garage -- a big asset in a neighborhood where parking is scarce and often a little sketchy.  Where: West Pacific Avenue near Arguello, in the Presidio.  Who's there: Marina, Pacific Heights and Richmond District moms, nannies and grannies.  Description: After its overhaul in 2003,  JK  became the  it  playground for Pacific Heights and Richmond District moms and their nannies. It's one of the loveliest settings for a playground in all of San Francisco, if not the Bay Area: sunny and sheltered, surrounded by softball and soccer fields, with the verdant Presidio as a backdrop. On the playground itself, a mini-climbing wall, spinning cups, and a spiderweb dome are a few of the highlights.  Best feature: The canal fed by a slow-drip water spigot, where kids create dams and rivers and build sand castles.  Downside: Can get seriously crowded on sunny days.  Bonus points: The clubhouse has arts and crafts classes for kids.  Where: Vicente Street and 26th Avenue.  Who's there: City softball and kid soccer leagues; anyone under the age of 7 seven who lives in the Sunset.  Description: Sitting on a knoll above Stern Grove, surrounded by ball fields and basketball courts, Parkside is one of the city's largest playgrounds, and the only one that is fully ADA (handicapped) accessible for people with disabilities. Two colorful play structures include long ramps, tube slides, and swinging bars. There's a giant spiderweb climbing dome, a sand area with water fountain, and unique see-saws and swings.  Best features: The bottom of one of the play structures is designed like the bow of a pirate ship with a cargo net. At the top, there's a spy glass for spotting yer mateys.  Downside: While the kids seem impervious, to the fog and wind, they can turn mom's lips blue.  Bonus points: In the summer, you can hear the music from the Stern Grove concerts below.  Where: Highland Avenue at Bocana Street.  Who's there: Kids in the 'hood (Bernal Heights, Holly Park, St. Mary's).  Description: Before 2004, most parents would have looked at you blankly if you asked them about Holly Park. Though it's one of the city's oldest green spaces, it had a reputation for being a bit rough and the playground was, well, lame. A dedicated community effort brought about a $2 million makeover, complete with colorful playhouses, slides, swings, cargo ropes and a lovely little picnic area off to one side. At the top of the hill, there are basketball and tennis courts, and spectacular views.  Best feature: A new-fangled stretchy-rope merry-go-round.  Downside: The wind can whip around here something fierce.  Bonus points: Its grassy hillside location makes this one of the best spots in town for barrel rolling.  Where: 20th and Vermont streets.  Who's there: A nice blend of new hipster parents, old-time Potrero Hillers and nannies.  Description: It's hard to beat the location of this park -- a bucolic, balmy square set atop snaky Vermont Street (the real  crookedest street in San Francisco ). Surrounded by gorgeous Victorians and pretty pocket gardens, the park feels a million miles away from the concrete jungle. McKinley features two play structures for big and little kids, and an all-sand floor (its 1999 renovation preceded some of the current high-tech playground materials). A full spectrum of slides -- corkscrew, tube, wavy -- offers nice variety, and there's a grassy area outside the fence for kicking a ball around.  Best feature: The old-fashioned cement-wall sandbox is great for keeping toddlers entertained ... and corralled.  Downside: No bathrooms, plastic play structures.  Bonus points: As my Texas Street compadres say,  It's always sunny on Potrero Hill.   Where: Lenox Way between Taraval and Ulloa streets.  Who's there: A regular round-up of the neighborhood 5-and-unders, and spillover from the yard at adjacent West Portal Elementary School.  Description: Reopened last year with a refurbished clubhouse, spruced-up bathrooms and new picnic tables, West Portal is a longtime parent favorite for its intimate feel and gently sloping grass field where kids chase balls and swing bats (equipment is often provided by the rec center).  Best feature: The wooden stationary train (BYO engineers).  Downside: It's on a steep hill atop the streetcar tunnel, and parking can be challenging.  Bonus points: The expanded clubhouse, which offers a full slate of music, arts and crafts and even cooking classes for kids.

            "input": "text:I first meet Dasha Zhukova in June, at the launch of her latest project - the Garage Centre for Contemporary Culture (GCCC), an enormous new art gallery in Moscow, housed in a disused Soviet bus depot. She is dressed like something out of Breakfast at Tiffany's, complete with Audrey Hepburn headband, and spends much of the evening holding hands with the man his friends call  Roma : Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich.  The evening itself is a spectacle. Most of the guests seem bamboozled by the generous hospitality: a feast of piri piri prawns, roast sirloin and cherry trifle flown in from London; a selection of cigarettes and vodkas and limitless Ruinart champagne, which is still flowing when I leave the after-party at 6am. Amy Winehouse plays a set that is rumoured to have cost  00a31m - a sum that Zhukova later denies - and although the singer is emaciated and definitely not sober, the appreciation of the 300-strong audience lifts her, and vocally she performs well. Zhukova unveils a stunning installation by Mexican artist Rafael Lozano-Hemmer - an interactive tree made up of thousands of lights, which pulsates in time to the beat of her heart. Abramovich looks on proudly, and, later, the couple dance.  The crowd represents the international art set: collectors, gallerists, artists including Jeff Koons, Marco Perego (Dolce & Gabbana's favourite artist) and British sculptor Conrad Shawcross. Although Charlotte Casiraghi (daughter of Princess Caroline of Monaco) turns up, Paris Hilton is a rumoured no-show. Not all of these people are Zhukova's friends - many at the launch have never met her. But they are part of the circle she is now keen to cultivate.  With the launch of GCCC, which officially opens in September, Zhukova,27, a Russian heiress, is increasingly intriguing. Born in Moscow and raised in Los Angeles, she has already been a homeopathy student, fashion designer and international It girl - although her most famous role is as Abramovich's girlfriend. And now, all of a sudden, she has turned arts mogul.  How does she describe herself, I ask, when we meet again for breakfast at the Berkeley Hotel in Knightsbridge, London, a favourite hang-out for wealthy Russians.  I generally don't like this question,  she says, wrinkling her perfect nose,  because it's so hard to answer. I have many interests and I like keeping busy and working on several projects at the same time. Right now I'm developing an arts centre. I don't see myself as a person who just does one thing. I understand that sometimes that might sound a bit unprofessional. But I disagree.   Whether she is a Renaissance woman or a wealthy dilettante, Zhukova, who is based between London, Moscow and Los Angeles, is keen to style herself as a serious force in the contemporary-arts world. As well as fronting Garage, as GCCC has already become known, she has dug deep into her own pockets to sponsor this year's Serpentine Gallery summer party in London on September 9 (the invitation reads:  With Dasha Zhukova, GCCC Moscow ). This is no small gesture: the party is one of the biggest events on the social calendar; previous sponsors include Yves Saint Laurent and Swarovski.  She already runs a successful cult fashion line, Kova & T, which is famous for its  00a375 Dasha Skinny jeans, and is beloved by the likes of Drew Barrymore. (The line is stocked by 50 outlets in the US, and sold in 12 other countries.) So why open a museum of contemporary art as well?  You know, I have no clear explanation,  she says in her Valley Girl drawl.  It is a bunch of things. I like to create, to do something new, something that does not have a predictable outcome. I love art and this project excites me and it has an incredible potential to be immensely challenging and satisfying. Of course, everyone wants to make a difference and help people or provide things they would be happy to see . . .  She trails off.  I have had an interest in art since childhood. I loved to draw as a child and still do. Though,  she makes a rare attempt at a joke,  my biggest admirer is my grandmother.   In her defence, she seems tired and slightly confused. She has come straight from a meeting at the Serpentine and, only hours before, more meetings at art galleries in New York. For the past few months she has been on a quest to educate herself in all matters concerning contemporary art.  I won't pretend to be the biggest connoisseur of the contemporary artists of today,  she says, awkwardly,  though I know and love it quite a lot.  She heads for the breakfast table and returns with a plate of tomatoes, croissant and ham. She orders still water. Up close, her skin is as dewy as a 16-year-old's and she has the most mesmerisingly flawless teeth. Her speech is peppered with Clueless expressions:  Or whatever . . .    Oh, cool ,  Yuh, yuh.  But she comes across as oddly middle-aged and serious.  She is more comfortable speaking American English than Russian and even pronounces her own surname with a hard Z and a long  oh  like an American (Zoo-kohva) instead of the Russian way (Zhuk-ova, with the accent on the first syllable). She dresses demurely: black leggings and cardigan, white ballet flats, no makeup, hair tied loosely back - a sort of anti-Victoria Beckham. She aims for anonymity, especially in London:  Sometimes you see photographers in places you would not expect, but overall it is pretty calm.   Her Moscow art project is, in many ways, a surprising turn of events. Having spent her early years in Russia, she went to live in the US at the age of 10 with her mother Elena, a molecular biologist and authority on diabetes, who took up jobs first in Houston, then Los Angeles. Her parents had divorced when she was a small child, - her father Alexander is an oil magnate and business associate of Abramovich's. Both her parents remarried and went on to have twins, so Zhukova is in the unusual position of feeling like an only child while also being the eldest of five siblings. She lived in the US for 12 years before returning to Russia.  The lonely transition to American life cannot have been easy. She went straight to school the day after her arrival, knowing no English. For the first few weeks she sat reading Pippi Longstocking in Russian at the back of the class.  When you're 10, you don't realise it's difficult. It's an adventure. When you're in a situation that is foreign to you, you just have to pull yourself together and adapt.   She will be needing this can-do attitude to launch Garage. The space is an avant-garde constructivist masterpiece designed in 1926 by the architect Konstantin Melnikov, and is reminiscent of Tate Modern's Turbine Hall. The centre will be privately funded by international sponsors, understood to include Abramovich, although Zhukova is also wealthy in her own right, thanks to her family's money. The director of the project is the aristocratic curator Mollie Dent-Brocklehurst, with the Tate's Sir Nicholas Serota rumoured to be joining the advisory board. GCCC's first exhibition, a retrospective of the work of New York-based husband-and-wife installation artists Ilya and Emilia Kabakov, is eagerly anticipated. Labelled  non-conformist  during the Soviet era, Ilya Kabakov is well-known in the west as one of Russia's greatest conceptualist artists - especially since his emigration from Moscow in the late 1980s. He has collaborated with his curator wife Emilia (a distant cousin: they met in Moscow during childhood) since their marriage in 1992, and together they create powerful, imposing installations such as The Palace of Projects, a 40-foot spiral structure that had its debut at the Roundhouse, in London, 10 years ago. The Kabakovs' work has rarely been seen in Russia and this opening is regarded as something of a coup for Moscow's fledgling contemporary arts scene.  It is difficult to measure how much Abramovich is investing in the project, but in May this year, around the time of Zhukova's birthday, he was revealed as the mystery buyer of Lucian Freud's Benefits Advisor Sleeping ( 00a317m) and Francis Bacon's Triptych ( 00a343m). As one arts patron puts it,  You don't buy that kind of thing unless you really want to show off what a big collector you are.  But Zhukova says, somewhat disingenuously:  I have never been a collector. I have a few pieces that I got for my birthdays or that I bought for myself: I acquire things that speak to me and put them on my wall. When I see things I like, I just know.  She doesn't get any more specific: when I ask her which artists she particularly likes, she says:  I'm, like, really bad at remembering names.   Many in Moscow believe that Zhukova and Abramovich want to style themselves as among the world's most serious art connoisseurs and that the centre will eventually become a showcase for their own private collection. The money they have can easily make more of a difference than state investment. This could prove a controversial contribution, though: in Russia, there is still intense resentment towards the oligarch class that the likes of Abramovich and Alexander Zhukov, Dasha's father, represent, with much of the population believing that the wealth of these individuals was made by impoverishing the Russian people. Even now, many are offended by the large sums of money that change hands. While Abramovich was spending  00a361m in one birthday spree, the Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, announced an  00a385m expansion of Moscow's State Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts, which attracts a million visitors a year and has one of the finest collections of Impressionist paintings in the world.  One interpretation of the Garage launch is that this foray into the art world is Zhukova's attempt to distance herself from Abramovich and establish her own identity. Despite the fact that I have met them both together, when I ask, she declines even to confirm their relationship, shaking her head whenever his name is mentioned. But all this mystery is to no avail: in Moscow, the gallery project is frequently linked to Abramovich rather than Zhukova. If it is annoying to find all your efforts being attributed to your boyfriend, though, Zhukova is too discreet to complain.  She brushes off the suggestion that she is part of a bigger cultural shift: the emergence of a privileged elite that is rediscovering its Russian roots and using philanthropy to invest in the motherland. This is, at least, one way for women to affect Russia's future. In Moscow, many dynamic women run businesses - often with a husband's or father's money - but few are able to break through into the well-connected circles of the super-rich. There are few women in Russian politics: when Irina Khakamada, once one of Russia's most prominent female politicians, ran against Putin in 2004, she said:  The first priority is not when will there be a first women president of Russia, but when the president will be someone not chosen by the oligarchs and the vlast [the powers that be].  (Khakamada resigned from politics in March this year.) Among the oligarchs there is only one woman, construction magnate Elena Baturina, wife of Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov.  Arguably, charity is one of the only routes dynamic young women have to affect Russia's future. Three years ago, Russian-born supermodel Natalia Vodianova (personal worth:  00a311m) launched her Naked Heart Foundation to fund urban playgrounds. Television presenter and socialite Ksenia Sobchak (daughter of the late Anatoli, once mayor of St Petersburg and Putin's political mentor) has dabbled in politics, founding youth movement All Free to little effect. Former Miss Russia Oxana Fedorova stood for election to the Duma and failed, and recently became a Unicef goodwill ambassador.  While Abramovich is understood to be on good terms with Putin, Zhukova comes across as apolitical. She won't even be drawn on the subject of her family's fortunes during the Soviet era: she says she doesn't know whether they were privileged or not. She is not remotely analytical about what she does, or about what it means in a wider context.  I definitely feel Russian. I feel Russian but at the same time when I'm in the States I feel at home too. I don't know if this is a patriotic gesture or just a lucky coincidence,  she says:  I just saw the building and thought: what a great place. Nothing ever turns out the way you plan it or imagine it.  Her plans for the centre sound ambitious but vague: she wants educational programmes, collaborations with fashion and interiors designers, a cafe, a library, a book shop.  Meanwhile, there are rumours that she and Abramovich are planning to marry in October. Abramovich has just rushed through planning permission for Britain's most expensive private residence - a  00a3150m palace behind Harvey Nichols in Knightsbridge - so perhaps she won't be spending that much time in Moscow after all.  Fedor Pavlov, director of the Russian arts group Marka:FF, says that this won't affect whether Garage is successful:  People will come and see the space because of Abramovich's name. He buys significant art works, giving a sense of assurance to those who are not yet sure whether it's worth collecting contemporary art. And Garage has an opportunity to become Moscow's Tate Modern - it will be for tourists, art professionals and just for ordinary people who want to know more about the taste of the wealthiest man in Russia.  People in art circles have started calling the place  Dashkin Garazh  (Dasha's Garage), says Pavlov, adding that  Dasha's reputation is controversial. People who know her adore her. Those who were 'accidentally' not invited to the Garage private opening already started hating her.  People are impressed, though, he says, by dynamic individuals who don't wait for state support, who just get on and do things:  She is a great sign for Russian contemporary culture.   There is only one other modern art centre in Moscow, the Winzavod Centre for Contemporary Art, which opened last year.  Russians don't understand contemporary art,  explains Moscow gallery owner Marina Goncharenko,  They are afraid of it. The level of appreciation is just not there. And the government does not support contemporary art.  In this climate, someone with Zhukova's youthful celebrity profile is ideal as an ambassador, says Olga Sviblova, director of the Moscow House of Photography, who has herself persuaded Abramovich to sponsor several photographic exhibitions in London and Moscow:  Dasha is very intelligent and she educates herself very quickly about everything to do with the art world. I think she will be able to bring this to a new audience here. It's certainly one of the most original spaces in Moscow.   Others are hopeful, but sceptical. Goncharenko says:  It will be very upsetting and distasteful if it's all just a game. 'Let's all go and live in London.' 'Let's all collect art now.' To develop this kind of project, you need a big plan and I hope they have one. If they're just playing at contemporary art, the sooner it's over the better. But if this is their life's work then it merits respect. If it's serious, then it's worthy. To develop something like this in Moscow requires a lot of energy and huge material investment. Because Russian art deserves this kind of legacy.   At least Zhukova is trying to do something, even if it is not quite clear what.  Dasha's reputation in the art world is not yet well established,  says Pavlov,  as people tend to think she is like a moth that flies to the light. To strengthen the Russian side of her character she would need to make more friends in Moscow just to become native - which is quite realistic given her Russian childhood. People talk of her as an exotic fruit from overseas.  Summary: Viv Groskop on the Russian heiress keen to style herself as a serious force in the contemporary-arts world",

            "input": "text:A woman looks at Denkmal der Maerzgefallenen in Weimar by Walter Gropius during the exhibition Bauhaus. A Conceptual Model in Berlin Photograph: Tobias Schwarz Reuters  It started as a controversial experiment in the social effects of art and design, producing ideas that were often considered impractical, uncomfortable and costly. But 90 years after its conception by radical and combative designers the Bauhaus movement is nowadays credited with having had the biggest influence of any movement on modern, minimalist style.  The biggest retrospective of the German art school has opened in Berlin, showing the movement's creations  2013 from weighing scales to seats shaped from gaspipes, coffee pots and the spartan elegance of a doctor's surgery  2013 and exploring its enduring effect on society.  The exhibition Modell Bauhaus, at the Martin-Gropius-Bau, celebrates the school's socialist ideology, according to which its designers sought to find a way to produce functional and affordable design, available to the masses. Modell Bauhaus, which will travel to New York's MoMA in November, explores the movement's adage  less is more , as well as the connection between the Bauhaus and modern, mass-produced design.  Many proponents of the decidedly non-conformist movement, which was founded in 1919 by the architect Walter Gropius, argue that, like it or loathe it, the Bauhaus' most powerful modern-day legacy is the Swedish flat-pack furniture store Ikea.  Mass-market design like Ikea's would be inconceivable today without the Bauhaus,  said the newly-appointed director of the Bauhaus foundation, Philipp Oswalt, in an interview ahead of the anniversary celebrations. Events taking place across Germany include dance and theatre productions, architectural tours, readings and workshops.  The movement is still very much in existence but nowadays it largely concentrates on urban planning rather than household objects. Gone too are the movement's utopian ideas about establishing a conflict-free world.  Today we have relinquished the naive hopes and realise that utopias are not enough,  Oswalt said. The Berlin exhibition charts the movement's progress through its 14-year existence, from the Weimar school, which was founded in 1919 to the Dessau school and finally to the Berlin school, led by architect Mies van der Rohe, that was closed by the Nazis in 1933. While some say the Nazi ban led to the movement's break-up, the very fact that many of its members fled to all corners of the world such as China, America and Israel allowed the Bauhaus influence to spread much more effectively than it might have done had its focus remained in Germany.  The exhibition makes much of the movement's desire to experiment, in objects such as Lothar Schreyer's design for a coffin for his wife, the striped dresses of Lis Volgers or Marcel Breuer's Clubsessel B3, a somewhat uncomfortable steel-frame armchair.  But it was not a case of all work and no play. Photographs document the members' penchant for partying. Partygoers were often invited to turn up to celebrations dressed up as the very household objects  2013 such as cooking pots and plates  2013 that the artists were attempting to redesign, and to enter the room via a large slide.

            "input": "text:With the South Carolina-Georgia game on the horizon, I'm here to represent the Bulldogs. While trash talk can be good-natured and fun, facts can be cruel. We're going to deal in facts.  In objective journalistic fashion, I'll start with two things I like about you: Your gas prices and the best college football prank ever pulled.  To be clear, that is all there is to like about South Carolina and Columbia.  Let's start with South Carolina's lack of identity. Dabo Swinney, beat him as soundly as you may, was irrefutably correct when saying that Carolina was in Chapel Hill and USC was in California. Hey, if I had to identify with the state of South Carolina, I would have an identity crisis myself. Do remember, your's is a state best-known for Myrtle Beach, a place that makes Panama City look like a quaint Mediterranean villa by comparison. So your next coping mechanism is to shroud yourself in  S-E-C!  chants. This is funny to me for two reasons:  1) When the conference expanded to 12 teams, you were the third choice (behind Florida State and Miami) for inclusion among Eastern teams! Said another way, you were the last moderately viable choice.  2) You have never won the SEC. You came close once, if 39-point losses qualify as close.  The phrase  act like you've been there before  would apply to your fanbase, but the fact is ... you haven't been there before. It's fitting that you won the ACC title in 1969, given that man walked on the moon the same year. As with the moon landing, it could be fake and nobody knows for certain that it happened. The mighty Gamecocks went 6-0 against an otherwise hapless conference and 1-4 in their other games, with a 14-3 Peach Bowl loss to West Virginia the closest among those four.  South Carolina's first bowl win came in 1995. A full half of your bowl appearances (18 in total) have come since 2001 in an era where you only have to win six games (out of 12) to get to one. You even screwed that up one year with the Clemson brawl in 2004.  As for recent history, South Carolina's success under Steve Spurrier is commendable. He was the man to finally get the program over .500 all-time even though it's still under .500 against the ACC, Big 10, Big XII, SEC, and get this: the Big East AAC. South Carolina's 1-1 against the Pac-12, so...congrats. You've played Sandstorm before kickoffs since 2006, even though it hit the airwaves in 2000 and was played out by 2004. Unfortunately, this correlates directly with your program's success.  You play Georgia this week. The fact that the Ol' Ball Coach has won three in a row against the Dawgs should make you feel good, but those triumphs raised your win percentage against Georgia to just over 26 percent all-time. Your Heisman candidate defensive end, coming off a stellar three-tackle performance against a hapless North Carolina team (in which over half of your offensive yards came on three broken plays), is set to be silenced again. When he is, we know you'll complain that he was sick, injured, held or tired, because he should get a sack every time the opponent's quarterback drops back to throw, right?  I'd say  good luck,  but historical precedent is clearly not on your side. Your best bet is to remain the rudest and least successful fans in the SEC and to do so from your concrete-and-abandoned-warehouse Detroit Jr. of a city you call home.  However, if you do show up, you'll notice a couple of things unfamiliar to your university:  1) Grass: A herbacious plant with narrow leaves growing from the base, normally the ground. We have it on our campus.  2) Class: Instead of waving a white towel (international signal for surrender, but I bet you knew that) and yelling GO COCKS in response to everything you say, we'll actually try to engage you in conversation at the University of Georgia.  3) We do have a robust bar scene with more than 70 watering holes within one mile of the stadium. Enjoy your time in an actual, honest-to-goodness, college town while you're here.  -- Chad Floyd is a contributor and editor at the blog Dude You Crazy. Follow him on Twitter @Chad_Floyd.

            "input": "text:On Monday, 24-year-old Gus Deeds was discharged from a rural Virginia hospital after a mental health evaluation, reportedly because there were no psychiatric beds available in the area, according to local media outlets.  The consequences seem to have been been exceptionally tragic: the day after being released, police believe, Gus Deeds likely stabbed his father, state Sen. Creigh Deeds, before killing himself. It 2019s not clear whether Deeds was ever diagnosed with a mental illness. But his discharge from Bath County Community Hospital appears to have been all too common: Americans are routinely shut out of mental health facilities across the country for lack of beds.  Nationally, the number of psychiatric beds has been steadily declining as hospitals moved away from institutionalizing patients and budget cuts have taken hold. The number of hospital beds in freestanding psychiatric hospitals has dropped 13% between 2002 and 2011, according to the American Hospital Association.  But the need hasn 2019t declined as quickly, and there haven 2019t been adequate alternatives to pick up the slack. Between April 2010 and March 2011, about 200 Virginia residents were deemed to be  201cin imminent danger to themselves or others as a result of mental illness or is so seriously mentally ill to care for self and is incapable or unwilling to volunteer for treatment. 201d But they were nevertheless released from custody because mental facilities didn 2019t have the capacity to admit them, according to a 2011 report from Virginia 2019s Inspector General.  In many major US cities, bed shortages have prompted emergency rooms to  201cwarehouse 201d the mentally ill in holding rooms and hallways, where they languish without treatment. One Seattle woman who tried unsuccessfully to commit her mentally disturbed son in 2011 was told there were no beds available; he killed himself days later.  Civil commitment laws prohibit states from indefinitely detaining people who are deemed to require a mental health evalution or hospitalization. The 2007 Virginia Tech shooting prompted an overhaul of the process, but the basics have remained the same: once someone receives an official mental health evaluation in Virginia, that person can be taken into custody against their will for four hours with the approval of a local magistrate judge, as reportedly happened with Gus Deeds. But even if a mental health professional decides that person needs to be committed, if there is no bed available within four hours 2019 time 2014or six hours with a magistrate 2019s approval 2014he or she must be released.   201cThis is a problem for many states with large rural areas that have downsized state hospitals, 201d says Richard Bonnie, a University of Virginia professor of law and medicine. A new UVA study showed that beds could not be found in time for 4 percent of mentally ill people recommended for involuntary commitment in Virginia before they had to be released.  Part of the downsizing is by design: For decades, American psychiatry has been moving away from the state psych wards of old and toward more community-based, privatized, and outpatient care. But advocates say far too little has been provided to fill in the gap. More than 50% of US counties  201chave no practicing psychiatrists, psychologists or social workers, 201d the AHA reports, and just 27% of community hospitals have an organized, in-patient psychiatric unit. In rural areas, access is even more challenging, as patients often have to travel long distances to reach providers and hospitals, and crisis intervention services have been particularly lacking on the local level.   201cPeople should not be locked up in state hospitals forever. The problem is that the community services which were supposed to be developed so that people could be served in the community aren 2019t being retained. That 2019s made access very, very difficult if someone really does need it, 201d says Mira Signer, executive director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness Virginia.  Funding for mental health services took a particular hit during the recession, The Virginia Tech shooting prompted the state government to add $42 million in additional funding for mental health services in 2008, but the support was soon gutted as the financial crisis took hold. Between 2009 and 2010, Virginia cut mental health funding by $38.5 million, or about 9%, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, and many states cut even more.  Virginia has slowly started re-investing in the system, increasing mental health funding in the 2013-14 budget by about $5.7 million, according to NAMI Virginia. Both of Virginia 2019s gubernatorial candidates promised to improve the state 2019s mental health services, and more would receive under the Medicaid expansion that Gov.-elect Terry McAuliffe has vowed to enact.  Advocates hope the momentum continues, warning that the country 2019s jails, emergency rooms, and homeless shelters will also bear the burden if there aren 2019t adequate mental health services.  201cActs of violence are exceptional, 201d says Signer.  201cWhen a tragedy like this happens, it 2019s because something in the mental health system has gone terribly wrong. 201d  Join national correspondent Suzy Khimm for a conversation about our country 2019s mental health systems Tuesday, November 26 at 4 p.m. EST in the comments of this article.

            "input": "text:On Friday, SeaWorld Entertainment announced that it is building new, bigger enclosures for its signature attractions  2014 the orcas (also known as killer whales). Their jumps and tricks have delighted some, but their alleged poor treatment and inadequate habitats have enraged others.  The theme park company said it plans to upgrade the killer whale tanks at three of its theme parks, starting with the one in San Diego, Calif. The new orca tanks will be 50 feet deep and have a surface area of nearly 1.5 acres.  Will improved conditions be enough to reverseSeaWorld 2019s declining revenue? Earlier this week the theme park company said its revenue dropped 1 percent in the three months ended June 30 during a period that 2019s considered the company 2019s peak season. SeaWorld SEAS also attributed its poor quarter to bad press following the release of the  201cBlackfish 201d documentary, which accused the theme park operator of mistreating orcas.  Wall Street wasn 2019t impressed and sent the company 2019s stock price down over 30 percent.  President and CEO Jim Atchison said in a press conference Friday afternoon that while the plans for the new habitats had been in the works for some time, he does think that it will have an impact on those people who were swayed by protests, or perhaps by the damning 2013 documentary, which has proven to be very popular on Netflix  2014 although he doesn 2019t think the move will appease animal rights activists.   201cThat 2019s not who we 2019re trying to appeal to, that 2019s not our market, 201d he said.  Tuna Amobi, an equity analyst at S&P Capital IQ, said that while the new habitats could be a step forward in reversing the company 2019s fortunes, it is by no means a wave of a magic wand.   201cThis is not going to have any immediate positive impact, 201d he said.  201cMost investors are kind of going to take a wait-and-see approach. 201d  Although the theme park has long been a target of animal rights groups, in the past few months the pressure on SeaWorld has intensified. This summer the animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) posted an ad in the San Diego airport featuring actress Kathy Najimy and the words  201cWelcome to San Diego! If you love animals like I do, please avoid SeaWorld, 201d according to a story in The Wall Street Journal. The animal rights group also had actress Jessica Biel submit a question on its behalf to Atchison at SeaWorld 2019s investor day (she asked when SeaWorld would develop a plan to move the orcas to a sea pen in a natural setting).  PETA spokesman Jared Goodman said that the new habitats announced Friday weren 2019t enough to satisfy his group, and called them  201cclearly a desperate move. 201d  He also said that PETA 2019s ad campaign and demonstrations would continue until the orcas are released into a coastal sanctuary, meaning that SeaWorld may still have to deal with negative headlines as it tries to rebuild its brand.   201cThis proposal is not going to change things and its not going to save the company, 201d Goodman said.  As far as investors go, Amobi thinks they should at least be relieved SeaWorld is admitting that negative press is an issue rather than solely blaming other factors, such as weather and school calendars.   201cI think that overall management understands now more than ever that this is an issue that needs to be addressed head on, 201d he said.  In addition to building the new habitats, SeaWorld announced it is giving more than $10 million to killer whale research and creating a partnership focused on ocean health.

It was an awesome spectacle as product launches go: Speeches by Arnold Schwarzenegger and Colin Powell, a panel of top executives from Google, eBay, Wal-Mart, FedEx, Coca-Cola, and Cox Enterprises, video messages from Diane Feinstein and Michael Bloomberg, a heart-tugging slide show about saving the planet, and finally, after eight years and $400 million raised, the unveiling of the Holy Grail in a box  2014 clean, inexpensive full-cell energy!   201cI would like to introduce to you the Bloom Energy Server, 201d said Bloom CEO K.R. Sridhar to applause yesterday as colored lights bounced off the hulking black box on stage.  201cThis is my baby, isn 2019t she beautiful? 201d  So did they pull it off? Does the Bloom box live up to its hype? Let 2019s let board member Colin Powell answer. He promised his wife he would install one of the energy-saving devices in their home instead of a conventional generator, he said, adding,  201cShe 2019s still waiting. 201d  The cornerstone of the presentation at eBay 2019s EBAY corporate headquarters in San Jose, California was supposed to be Bloom 2019s happy corporate customers  2014 20 Fortune 100 companies in all  2014 but a quick survey of some of them reveals that, in many important respects, the Bloom box remains in stealth mode.  Coca-Cola KO says its first Bloom fuel cells probably won 2019t be installed until September. Bank of America BAC ? Sometime later this year. FedEx is close but still not online. Two firms who actually have experience with the Bloom Box since the first units were shipped 18 months ago  2014 Google GOOG and Wal-Mart WMT  2014 declined Fortune 2019s interview requests.  FedEx FDX did agree to talk but won 2019t answer the most important question: How much are they paying for Bloom-box electricity?  201cWe 2019re under a contractual agreement not to disclose the price, 201d says Mitch Jackson, FedEx 2019s senior director of environmental affairs.  Okay, so let 2019s do the math ourselves: Bloom says each 100-kilowatt Bloom box is sold for $700,000 to $800,000. Factoring in the price of the natural gas that most often fuels the unit brings the cost to 8 to 10 cents per kilowatt hour. Hey, that 2019s cheaper than the 11-cent average retail cost of electricity you can get from the coal-powered grid!  FedEx ran the numbers, too. The five 100 kilowatt systems it 2019s installing at its west coast sorting hub in Oakland, at $750,000 each, would cost $3.75 million. But the energy production is so cost-effective, Jackson says,  201cIt should pay for itself in less than five years. 201d  But look at the fine print: That 8-to-10-cents per kilowatt hour includes huge government subsidies  2014 a 30% federal tax credit and $2,500-per-kilowatt rebate from the state of California (see editor 2019s note below). Take out those subsidies and the true cost of the Bloom box is 13 cents to 14 cents per kilowatt hour, according to analysis by Lux Research  2014 significantly higher than electricity from the fossil-fuel powered grid.  Grid power also doesn 2019t require the headache of owning your own power plant. Yes, Bloom offers a 10-year warranty and will maintain the unit, but if the system fails  2014 and reliability is a major issue for fuel cells  2014 companies would have to plug back into the grid, which for all its drawbacks remains enormously reliable. A replacement for the grid? So far, it 2019s more like a supplement at best.  FedEx offers a compelling example: The company says its new Bloom boxes will be enough to provide about 55% of its facility 2019s energy needs. Another 20% comes from 5,700 solar panels. The rest will come from the grid, which also serves as a convenient backup should the Bloom boxes fail (performance guarantees are built into the company 2019s contract with Bloom, Jackson says).  So when can FedEx start installing Bloom boxes in the vast majority of states that don 2019t offer subsidies?  201cThat 2019s a question for Bloom, not us, 201d says Jackson.  201cAny of these technologies, including solar and wind, have to be cost-effective on their own to be commercially viable over the long term. 201d In the meantime, until the economics work out, at least FedEx employees can help the environment: The Bloom boxes will cut carbon emissions at the Oakland facility by 30 to 35%.  201cIf you combine Bloom boxes with our solar electric array, we should reduce our carbon footprint by around half, 201d Jackson says.  So if Bloom 2019s magic boxes are still not cost-effective nationwide  2014 if they remain a niche product still in beta testing  2014 why today 2019s star-studded coming-out party? Sridhar says his customers were so excited by the product they pushed him to unveil his creation now. Though they were clearly jazzed about the chance to brag about their green cred  2014 and moments at yesterday 2019s event devolved into an orgy of self-congratulation  2014 many observers think Bloom had another motive: To prime the pump to go public.   201cFrom Bloom 2019s point of view, an IPO is the number one priority, 201d says Jacob Grose, senior analyst with Lux Research, who says the success of last year 2019s public offering by lithium-ion battery maker A123 showed that the market may be ripe for another clean-tech play.  201cI 2019d be shocked if this were not a prelude to an IPO over the next 12 to 18 months. 201d  So after eight years and $400 million, Sridhar needs more time and more money  2014 perhaps another five years to make the Bloom boxes cost-effective, analysts say. For the planet 2019s sake, let 2019s hope he pulls it off. Until then  2014 after all the hoopla  2014 the bottom line remains the same as it was last week: The Bloom box remains a promising idea whose time is yet to come.  An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that California 2019s rebate is $2,500 per kilowatt-hour. The correct figure is $2,500 per kilowatt.

If the Chinese Internet giant prices at the high end of its $60 to $66 a share range, it will bring in $21.1 billion.  Much has been touted about the company 2019s brilliant growth potential as it pioneers Internet retail in China, and investors have already flocked to get into the deal. In its prospectus Alibaba says it has 279 million online customers who spend nearly $300 billion on the company 2019s sites. By those metrics, it would be the largest online and mobile seller in the world  2014 and its IPO hype would be justified.  Alibaba 2019s massive offering would put it at the top of the biggest-ever U.S. IPO list, beating out Visa V , which currently holds the record after it raised $17.9 billion in 2008, according to Bloomberg data. Standout tech companies such as Google GOOG and Amazon AMZN don 2019t even make the list.  And if the bankers choose to execute an option to sell more shares, Alibaba 2019s IPO sum could jump to $24.3 billion, beating out Agricultural Bank of China to become the biggest IPO worldwide.  At the high end of its IPO price range, Alibaba would bring in enough money to give it a market capitalization of $162.7 billion. That would make it larger than Amazon, but less than half the size of Google 2019s massive market value.  Alibaba 2019s stats sound huge in its prospectus: its 279 million shoppers bought $248 billion in gross merchandise volume sold. Its mobile sales expanded 100% last year. Those are impressive figures.  Much further down, on page 94, Alibaba records its most recent annual revenue: $8.5 billion.  That beats out only Facebook FB (see chart below). Amazon brought in almost 9 times that much in its most recent fiscal year. (Wal-Mart 2019s WMT figures, not shown on the chart, dwarfed everyone at $245.7 billion.)  The comparison is not exactly apples-to-apples. Alibaba 2019s business model is similar to that of Ebay, in that it is a middleman coordinating sellers and buyers. Alibaba doesn 2019t house and manage any products itself. Gross merchandise volume, the metric the company likes to highlight, is the total sum of goods and services transacted on all its sites.  Alibaba 2019s revenue is the cut it takes out of each sale. In comparison, Wal-Mart 2019s nearly $250 billion in revenue represents the total value of all the goods purchased along with their built-in margins.  This shows how complicated it is to value Alibaba. While Fortune 2019s Shawn Tully points out that Alibaba would have to grow at breakneck speed to justify its IPO price, others are arguing that Alibaba at $66 a share is cheap. And some, such as short seller Carson Block, are even outright critical of Alibaba 2019s business model.  No matter how the IPO shakes out, there will be at least one big winner next week: Yahoo YHOO . The company 2019s 22% stake in Alibaba is worth at least $31.4 billion, at the low-end of the IPO range, and will likely be worth much more once the stock hits the market. Summary: The Chinese Internet giant 2019s massive offering would put it at the top of the biggest-ever U.S. IPO list, beating out Visa, which currently holds the record.",

            "input": "text:Bill Brandt: A Centenary Retrospective V&A, London SW7, until 25 July  Bill Brandt: Portraits National Portrait Gallery, London WC2, until 30 August  It is a testament to the enduring power of his images that, on the centenary of his birth, Bill Brandt is being lauded by the Victoria & Albert Museum as 'Britain's best-loved photographer of modern times'. That Brandt was actually born in Germany, and did not settle in Britain until 1931, aged 27, hardly seems to matter. His photographs of a beleaguered Britain, during and after the Second World War, have made his the foremost social documentation of British life in the last century.  Brandt was a shy, self-effacing and intensely secretive individual, uneasy with his German origins to such an extent that he reinvented himself as an Englishman, insisting until his death in 1983 that he had been born in south London rather than Hamburg. Though he willed himself to be English, and captured Englishness on camera like no one before or since, his gaze was that of the outsider. He had assisted Man Ray in Paris in 1929, and surrealism, that most European of twentieth-century art movements, informed even his social reportage. An image such as Miners Returning into Daylight from 1934 is startling not just for its depiction of working class hardship, but for its dark, subversive humour: eyes like white pinpricks stare out of sooted faces that call to mind blacked-up minstrels or theatrical demons as much as exhausted workers. A gaggle of animated ticktack men at Epsom racecourse, captured from ground level, look for all the world like shadow boxers in some lost Bu 00f1uel film.  His portraits, some included here, many more on display simultaneously at the National Portrait Gallery, show that, even in his magazine work, Brandt never lost his sense of surrealist mischief. He framed Pinter beneath a blackened railway arch, looking like a close relative of the Krays. He captured Le Carr 00e9 peering out from behind some shrubbery in a Victorian cemetery, the name 'John' just visible on the gravestone in the foreground. Often, as in his celebrated shot of Francis Bacon on Primrose Hill in 1963, he foregrounds the subject in a looming and ominous landscape that suggests a Britain unchanged since Victorian times.  For all their subversion, these portraits emphasise that Brandt was first and foremost a supreme formalist, a master of composition. The first portrait here is of a young and defiant Ezra Pound, and dates from Brandt's apprenticeship in a photographic studio in Vienna in the Twenties. Contrast it with his later, more staged studies of Laurie Lee or Henry Moore, and you see the development - no pun intended - of a vision that grows both more refined and more mischievous until, some time in the Forties, it becomes a signature.  A smaller show in an adjacent room shows some beautifully maintained scrapbooks belonging to his wife Eva, many of which feature familiar images before Brandt had cropped them, or reversed the negatives, or, long before digital manipulation, touched them up a bit to obtain the desired effect. In an early semi-surrealist shot of a fountain in Barcelona, he didn't capture the rain to his satisfaction, so he simply sketched in falling droplets of water.  For all his personal self-effacement, Brandt seems to have been certain of himself as an artist to the point where he openly acknowledged his influences throughout his working life. Chief among them may be Brassai, whose Paris by Night he homaged in his own London by Night series. Here, London bobbies stand sentinel in the shadows over a sleeping capital populated by tired revellers, knots of overcoated young men huddled in alleyways or on corners. A tramp rooting in a dustbin before a startled young man in formal attire signals the later work for which Brandt is perhaps best known, his documenting of British social life during and just after the war. As an outsider posing as an Englishman, he was acutely attuned to the class distinctions that in the Thirties created a country made up of two distinct nations. The elite are caught at play in ballrooms and social gatherings, the poor are pictured amid grime and deprivation. A single year separates the image of dinner-suited and fur-draped couples captured in Cocktails in a Surrey Garden,1935, and the stooped figure pushing a bike though a blackened landscape in Coal-searcher Going Home to Jarrow,1936, but the subjects might as well inhabit different planets.  By 1938, Brandt was in thrall to artificial light, trawling the night-time streets of the capital with his lamps and cables, drawn once again by the surreal possibilities of shadows and semi-darkness. Using long, slow exposures of up to half an hour, he lit up Bayswater to look like Vienna, captured St Paul's in moonlit silhouette, the remains of a blitzed building in the foreground looking like the ruins of the Parthenon.  By the mid-Forties, you can see his vision shifting once again. 'When I find a landscape I want to photograph,' he said, 'I wait for the right season, the right weather, the right time of day or night, to get the picture I know to be there.' Stonehenge arising out of the snow beneath a glowering sky is elemental going on mystical, the first hints of a late-flowering style that lent both his landscapes and his late nudes - and his eventual merging of the two - an otherworldliness that, though still steeped in surrealism, is all his own.  Somewhere along the way, though, perhaps around the time of his first, still arresting female nude - The Policeman's Daughter, Hampstead 1945 - Brandt's way of seeing the world had darkened. In 1944, he found a Kodak wide-angle camera by accident in a shop in Covent Garden. Its fixed lens was designed for use by the police in recording crime scenes, but with this determinedly old-fashioned instrument, Brandt took most of his late nudes, their perspectives distorted, their settings the bleak rooms of Victorian buildings. By the time he was creating his Nudes in Landscapes series, his way of seeing was literally dictated by the lens. 'I photographed what the camera was seeing,' he said of these still extraordinary images, where the human and the elemental merge. 'I interfered very little, and the lens produced anatomical inmates and shapes which my eyes had never observed.'  A surrealist to the end, Bill Brandt brought a distinctly European gaze to bear on his emphatically English subject matter and, in doing so, showed his adopted country, and its people, in a whole new light. 'Over and over again,' writes Paul Delany in his illuminating new biography, Bill Brandt: A Life , 'the history of art shows how the extraordinary vision of a culture ends up being the typical one.' That, in essence, was Bill Brandt's achievement, to render the everyday extraordinary, to light up the familiar until we could see it anew in all its beautiful strangeness. Summary: Photography: In his studies of postwar England, Bill Brandt brought a surreal, European eye to his adopted homeland.",

            "input": "text:I was arguing in this column (March 13) that museums all too often make basic mistakes in the display and lighting of sculpture. A reader, Paul Bonaventura of the Ruskin School of Drawing, wrote to suggest I was oblivious to the fact that some of the best sculptors wanted to create objects  that function, at least in part, as shadow-throwing devices or in silhouette . Two examples he gave were Bernini's Ecstasy of Saint Teresa and Rodin's The Walking Man. The other two were contemporary.  But the problem is not with contemporary art. Nor is it likely to arise with that great ensemble by Bernini, which is in the Cornaro Chapel, in the church of Santa Maria della Vittoria in Rome (from which it does not travel). Bernini, something of a stage designer as well as an architect, painter and sculptor, planned the Ecstasy so that it is illuminated by a concealed source of natural light (above the famous sculpture itself) which appears to be directed along gilded rays.  Very fortunately, this great masterpiece remains in the setting designed for it, which enjoys two other sources of natural light (a stained glass window in the transept, and reflected light from the nave) and would have had the benefit, as Charles Avery reminds us in his monograph, of innumerable candles on feast days. We know exactly what effect Bernini wanted, because the whole chapel is like a mechanism for creating that effect.  What about Rodin? What did Rodin want for his Walking Man? This is a sculpture that belongs both to the beginning and to the end of the great man's career. In its earlier manifestation, it is a bearded figure of John the Baptist. In its latter version, it loses its head and arms and is enlarged. Rodin supervised its display at the Farnese Palace in Rome (then and now the French Embassy). It was placed in the centre of the courtyard, though Rodin said that anywhere in the courtyard would do.  I have in front of me a photograph from 1912 on which Rodin has indicated in pen how the plinth (a temporary version in wood) should be tapered in order to create a less massive effect. Clearly he was happy with the height of the display and with the piece being shown in daylight. So, if the sculptor's intentions are to be respected (the assumption made by Paul Bonaventura, which I share), neither the Bernini nor the Rodin undermines the point I was making, that  diffuse daylight is great, when it is available .  It is true that if I turn the page of the book I am consulting (In Rodin's Studio by Albert E Elsen) I come to another photo from the same year, a gum print by Haweis and Coles, in which the statue has lost its plinth as it appears to float before a vague landscape. This is a high-contrast image, in which most of the detail of the piece is lost, leaving only certain areas of chest, kneecap and thigh as a clue to the plasticity of the object. And it is true that this kind of photo was carefully vetted and sanctioned by Rodin.  But this is a photograph - it is not an installation shot. It conveys an impression. It does not recommend a method of display, any more than Steichen's great photograph of the monument to Balzac by night is supposed to recommend that this monument be displayed in a dark room.  The issue between Bonaventura and me is one of what is called, in museum cant,  interpretation .  Experienced curators and exhibition lighting experts,  Bonaventura tells us,  sometimes play with these preoccupations in illuminating displays, and it is misguided to castigate all such experiments as horror-inspired, sexed-up or perverse.  Alas it is precisely the exhibition lighting experts, and their habits of interpretative  play , who are doing so much damage - not to the objects themselves, but to our ability to perceive them. Much of the problem with the new V&A British Galleries was caused by experienced curators working with exhibition lighting experts.  Of course, there are experts and experts. The new display of Italian Renaissance bronzes at the Metropolitan Museum in New York is very brilliantly lit, in both senses of the word. The Adriaen de Vries show at the Rijksmuseum not long ago, which brought together numerous large bronzes, placed each figure beneath a square of white scrim, through which the numerous spotlights shone on each. The purpose was to provide multiple sources of diffuse light for every large sculpture on display.  The purpose was not to play with preoccupations. The works of art had come from far and wide - no one had seen so many of them together, not since the Thirty Years' War. And the assumption would be that most visitors had not even thought about de Vries's work. Their first requirement would be: they would want to be able to see it. If they could see it, they might be able to interpret it. But what an impoverishment it would have been if all they could have seen was some expert's shadow, some daft curator's interpretation. Summary: Displaying sculpture is too important to be left to the lighting experts, argues James Fenton",

            "input": "text:Updated OCT 06, 2014 8:36p ET  TUCSON, Ariz. -- Arizona coach Rich Rodriguez is well aware his team will be congratulated plenty this week for knocking off No. 2 Oregon last week. It started Friday and will probably last until Saturday when USC visits Arizona Stadium.   It's probably from the same people who didn't mention anything to them a week or so ago,  Rodriguez said Monday.  Winning does that. Believing all the talk is the problem. Having a chip on your shoulder isn't.   It's like poison,   Rodriguez said.  It's OK unless you swallow it.   Case in point: Thursday night's gave vs. Oregon. The words: bigger, stronger, faster were used to describe the Ducks.  It meant nothing. Arizona countered with grit and determination. Now, UA has been rewarded -- sort, of -- with a No. 10 ranking in this week's Associated Press poll.   I don't mind, because it don't matter,  Rodriguez said.  It don't matter. I told the team, it don't matter right now. It matters at the end but not right now. But if it helps us get a little bounce in our guy's steps and the fans will be happy and be in the stands Saturday night, then it will be (good).   Later Monday afternoon the game had been declared a sellout.  As for the rankings, 10 is but a number. A good number, but ...   Making the big leap is pretty good, but our mindsets are pretty good,  said defensive back Will Parks.  Our mindsets won't change. It's stay humble, stay ready and stay focused for whatever challenge comes our way.   The No. 10 ranking is Arizona's highest since 1999. But even so, odds makers have USC as a 2-point favorite on Saturday night (down from an opening line of three).   I'm glad we are the underdog,  said Parks.  That keeps the guys focused for the task at hand. USC is a pretty good team. But we will prepare just like every other team that comes into our house.   Arizona hasn't started a season with six wins since going 7-0 to start the season in 1993, eventually finishing 10-2 and beating Miami in the Fiesta Bowl. In 1999, the Wildcats started 5-0 and then lost to UCLA at home. They regrouped from there and eventually defeated Nebraska in the Holiday Bowl to finish No. 4 in the polls.

Though roller coasters aren't for the faint of heart, they do attract a number of different ages. Every year means an added inch or two closer to reaching a height requirement for a ride a youngster has always dreamed of.  Living in the United States, home to Six Flags and Cedar Point, we are privileged to be closely distanced to some of the best roller coasters in the world. From the tallest steel coaster to the fastest wooden coaster, these rides might be right in your home state.  As of late, many problems arise when accidents and faulty constructions result in injuries and even sometimes deaths. But roller coaster companies do their best to develop new ways to build and implement safer rides.  Manufacturers such as Intamin, Rocky Mountain Construction, S&S Worldwide, or The Gravity Group continue to be big names in the theme park industry. And the manufacturers are always looking to beat a World Record by engineering some of the biggest and baddest rides on the planet. So here we 2019ve compiled a list of the craziest records that they have beaten, from the steepest angles, to longest rides to tallest, these are the big bad coasters that are sure to have you screaming a higher pitch then you knew possible.  A new addition to the Six Flags Great America park is the record breaking wooden roller coaster, Goliath. Traveling up to 72 miles per hour, this wooden coaster has two upside down inversions and the longest wooden roller coaster drop at 180 feet. It also set the record at the steepest wooden record drop of 85 degrees.  This steel accelerator roller coaster comes in second to Kingda Ka but still means serious business. Located in Cedar Point Park in Sandusky, Ohio, Top Thrill Dragster held the title of tallest and longest drop before Kingda Ka was built. It launches from 0 to 120 miles per hour in less than four seconds, and brings you up to over 400 feet in the air following with the second largest drop in the world at 400 feet.  Coming in second for the longest wooden roller coaster drop to Goliath (previously mentioned), El Toro brings out the power of the bull. It has a drop height of 176 feet and reaches a top speed of 70 miles per hour. Along with many other top coasters, El Toro is located in Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson, New Jersey.  Coming in at 8,133 feet, Steel Dragon 2000 is by far the longest steel roller coaster in the world. Located at Nagashima Spa Land amusement park in Mie Prefecture, Japan. Opening in the year 2000, the coaster was appropriately named because of its opening falling within  201cThe Year of the Dragon. 201d  Opening in 1979, The Beast is a main attraction at Kings Island in Mason, Ohio. The coaster is the longest wooden roller coaster in the world at 7,359 feet and the ride lasts for over four minutes (that 2019s a long time in roller coaster time!)  The famed Takabisha may just be the scariest roller coaster you can ride. It has a drop angle of 121 degrees making it the steepest in the world. Located in the Fuji-Q Highland theme park in Fujiyoshida, Yamanashi, Japan this ride attracts thrill seekers everywhere.  Coming in second to Goliath (of 85 degrees), Outlaw Run, a wooden roller coaster at Silver Dollar City amusement park in Branson, Missouri, has a steep drop of 81 degrees from 162 feet in the air. Outlaw Run was the first wooden roller coaster with multiple inversions (or upside-down loops) making it a truly thrilling ride.  Inversions, or instances when the the coaster turns riders upside-down and then back again can be one of the most stomach-turning aspects of the ride. The Smiler, located at Alton Towers in Staffordshire, United Kingdom broke the world record with 14 total inversions. The ride also includes blinding lights, optical illusions, and twisted effects to mess with your mind.

The 10 Players Drafted Before J.J. Watt In 2011  The 10 Players Drafted Before J.J. Watt In 2011  Few people enjoy the trifecta Newton enjoyed starting in his last season at Auburn. The quarterback won the Heisman Trophy and then led the school to a BCS Championship before the Panthers picked him first overall.  Newton may not be as elite a player as Watt, but it's hard to argue with Carolina taking him with the top pick. He's a two-time Pro Bowler who led the Panthers to the second round of the playoffs last year.  Like Newton, Von Miller had a strong track record coming out of college. He was a two-time AP All-American who led the NCAA in sacks in 2009.  Miller actually won the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year award over Watt in 2011. The one blemish on his resume came in 2013, when he missed the first six games of the NFL season to serve a suspension for allegedly trying to cheat on a drug test. But on the field, Miller has shined, making the Pro Bowl twice.  Combining size with surprising speed, Marcell Dareus was a nightmare for anyone facing Alabama's defensive line. The defensive end was a sight to see when picking up a fumble and running it back at an impressive clip.  Darueus brought that dominance into the NFL, where he's a star player on an underrated Buffalo defense. Despite having legal troubles involving guns and controlled substances, Dareus was a 2013 Pro Bowl selection.  Standing 6-foot-4, Green was a star from day one at Georgia, using his length to dominate the opposition en route to two straight All-SEC team selections.  But one could argue Green is even more dominant in the NFL, accumulating 30 touchdowns in his short career while earning three straight Pro Bowl selections.  Peterson's 2010 season at LSU was truly special. As a sparkplug for the Tigers' defensive and special teams units, Peterson was a unanimous All-America choice, as well as winner of the Thorpe Award and Bednarik Award.  In the NFL, little has changed. Peterson still stars regularly on defense and special teams, and he's become one of the most renowned cornerbacks in the league.  Jones earned acclaim at Alabama as a rare true freshman starter on the team. He developed into one of the team's most reliable stars on a team that won the BCS Championship in 2010.  Playing opposite receiver Roddy White, Jones has had an exceptional career. In 2012, he made the Pro Bowl thanks to a 1,200-yard, 10-touchdown season.  Aldon Smith was a big contributor at Missouri since he was a freshman, when he won the Big 12 Freshman of the Year award.  Smith started just as quickly in the NFL, setting the 49ers' rookie sack record and winning NFC Defensive Player of the Year in 2012. But after a run-in with TSA at an airport, during which he allegedly became belligerent, Smith was handed a nine-game suspension for this season.  Locker was considered an excellent pro prospect in college, where he led Washington while running a pro-style offense and displaying accurate throwing and strong footwork.  But Locker's career with Tennessee has been a roller coaster, with flashes of brilliance weighed down by injuries and poor decision-making. Without more consistent play, Locker's time as a starter might be winding down.  At USC, Smith became one of college football's best lineman while protecting Trojan quarterbacks that also went to the NFL.  In Dallas, Smith has evolved into a reliable Pro Bowl lineman. His service is one reason the Cowboys have jumped out to a fast start this season.  Gabbert was an electric quarterback in college, where he displayed great ground speed to go with a beautiful throwing motion.  But Gabbert didn't translate to the NFL game. He struggled with timing and comfort in the pocket and lost his starting job last season. This past NFL draft, the Jaguars selected Blake Bortles to start their QB project anew.  J.J. Watt was already a monster in college. After two years at Central Michigan, Watt transferred to Wisconsin, where he won the Lott Trophy in 2010.  But you could make a strong argument that Watt has been even better in the NFL. This year alone, he's scored three touchdowns -- a remarkable feat for a defensive end.

            "input": "text:Zaha Hadid was flying to Frankfurt to give a talk, in which I was her interlocutor. Her plane taxied from its stand, developed a minor fault, and stopped. She refused to believe the reassurances that the delay would be brief, and demanded that she be put on another flight. Her wish was impossible  2013 to return to the stand, to unload and reload her baggage in the hold, it couldn't be done  2013 but Hadid insisted, vigorously. The cabin staff tried to calm her, warn her, admonish her, until a stewardess noticed that this was the same woman whose picture was in the current edition of the in-flight magazine, attached to a profile of the Pet Shop Boys, for whom she had designed a set.  Are you Zaha Hadid?  she asked. Then the impossible became possible, and the architect got to change planes.  There are hundreds of stories like this about Hadid and they tell the same story, which is also that of her life: the testing of boundaries, the determination to get her way, the fury, the indifference to practical constraints, the opposition of conventional society, here represented by the cabin crew. And then the ultimate victory aided by fame, a fame earned through personality and talent.  To say she divides opinion is to put it mildly. To some, including several fellow architects that I spoke to, she is a tyrant; her work is  unbelievably arrogant  and  oppressive; I don't believe she cares what it's like actually to be in one of her buildings . To others she's a genius, and a hero, the only ground common to all these views being a remark once made by her mentor, Rem Koolhaas, that she is  a planet in her own inimitable orbit . The truth is that she is all these things, and more. She tests everyone  2013 her staff, her clients, the users of her buildings, and herself  2013 and offers an unspoken deal. If you survive all this, I will make something fantastic, and you could be part of it, is roughly how it goes, and people's view of her will depend on which part of the deal they experience most.  Over the past decade or so Hadid has gone from being the Architect Who Never Got Anything Built to someone who can't stop building. At the turn of the millennium she was still best known for winning at an early age the competition to design the Peak in Hong Kong, a leisure complex that was never realised, and for her martyrdom in Cardiff. Here, although she twice won the commission to design the city's opera house, local politicians did everything they could to ensure they got a mediocre project by another practice. Now, her office boasts 400 staff and 950 projects in 44 countries. Their work includes colossal developments in Changsha, China, and in Bratislava, a large luxury villa in Moscow and a role advising on the airport that Boris Johnson would like to build in the Thames Estuary.  Hadid's first building was a fire station near the German-Swiss border, for the furniture company Vitra, a building that celebrated its 20th birthday this summer. This autumn two of her more important projects are opening, at opposite ends of the constructional scale. In Baku, Azerbaijan, there is the colossal Heydar Aliyev cultural centre, a billowing creation that promises to be the most complete realisation yet of the Hadid universe. The Serpentine Sackler is opening in Kensington Gardens, a conversion and extension of an 1805 gunpowder store that will be a sister gallery to the nearby Serpentine. The latter is to the Baku building as a waterdrop is to a whale, but significant because it is in the heart of London, a place that, although it has been her base for 40 years, has been slow to build her works. It is not however her first building in the capital. There is also the Evelyn Grace academy in Brixton, which won the Stirling prize in 2011; a little further from the centre her Olympic Aquatics Centre is reopening next year, adapted from its games mode to a swimming pool for public use.  The rapid expansion of Hadid's practice has several causes, including its own determination to lose its  unbuildable  tag. Most of all it is a consequence of the 00s boom in  iconic  buildings, when spectacular architecture was believed to work regenerative miracles for the cities and companies that bought it. Hadid, equally extraordinary in her personality and architecture, is the perfect iconic architect. She is collectible, with her furniture designs commanding astounding prices. When money vanished in the west, oil-rich and Asian countries carried on. Her earlier buildings tend to be in European or American cities insecure about their urban dynamism  2013 Wolfsburg, Leipzig, Strasburg, Cincinnati, the outskirts of Basel. Now she's popular in China, Russia, Azerbaijan and Saudi Arabia.  Now aged 62, Hadid has won all the biggest awards in her business. She is a celebrity, a phenomenon, continuously feted, with connections with Brad Pitt and Barack Obama. She has also bought, for a reported  00a310m, the building that the Design Museum will vacate when it moves to new premises in 2015, whose purpose is to house her archive, and to  engage in a collective dialogue by exhibiting the research and innovation of global collaborations in art, architecture and design . A prototype of this institution can be seen in the design gallery she has opened in Clerkenwell. On its ground floor there is her extravagantly curvilinear furniture; upstairs is kept an ever-expanding array of architectural models.  Her temper provokes fear, but she also inspires admiration. Where many leading architects seem robotic, Hadid is human  2013 funny, frank, unafraid to show her emotions, sometimes fond of talking a little dirty. Aaron Betsky, writer, museum director, and an old friend, says:  People wonder why anyone works for her, given that she can be a stern taskmaster, but she can also show incredible loyalty and support, and passion for what she does.  She has worked hard since student days, sometimes succumbing to bouts of illness. She has never married or had children, although she has denied that she sacrificed family life to her work.  I'm sure I could have managed,  she told Lynn Barber in the Observer in 2008.  Stories abound of her grandeur, such as dispatching an assistant from the Venice Architecture Biennale to her London flat, who returned with the shoes she wanted to wear for a particular party, but she can also be down-to-earth. Rather than occupy an exclusive room, she preferred for years to sit among the tables in the old school house that is her practice's office, throwing out instructions to staff. She has shown courage, not least in overcoming the real obstacles of being a woman and an Arab in a white, male business. She dresses spectacularly, never favouring the mannish jackets and boyish haircuts with which some women in her profession attempted to smuggle their gender past the invisible barriers. Her approach was to blow them down.  Julia Peyton-Jones, co-director of the Serpentine Gallery, has said that Hadid's life and her work constitute  an all-encompassing vision  and  a complete work of art , that she is  a pioneer ,  well ahead of her time . In the Hadid-designed Roca showroom in west London, a curvaceous sci-fi quasi-shrine with the ostensible purpose of selling bathroom fittings, a visitors' book is rich in tributes. One reads:  One of the most beautiful experiences in the life. I am the future. Best best xxx love.  Also:  a mesmerising trip to the future ;  I love Zaha Hadid. Very peaceful place ; and  I trust in Zaha Hadid. I was sure that this place should be amazing!   From Peyton-Jones to the scribblers in the Roca book, there are common themes: Hadid is amazing, and she shows us the future. The same themes can be found in her own and her practice's descriptions of her work. Her senior partner, Patrik Schumacher, with whom she has worked for 25 years, has written that her designs are  manifestos of a new type of space  that pursue  the conquest of a previously unimaginable realm of constructive freedom .  The love is not, however, universal. The Beijing Cultural Heritage Protection Centre, for example, has stated that it is  shocked  that Hadid's Galaxy Soho development of shops and offices has been given an RIBA award. Where RIBA's president, Angela Brady, praised its  visionary new thinking about urban issues , the heritage group called it  a typical example of the destruction of Beijing's old town . Hadid has been criticised for her Baku project, commissioned to glorify a regime notorious for its human rights abuses, and for its forced evictions of homeowners to make way for new development. Here at least she has the company of Lord Foster and Rem Koolhaas, who have designed comparable monuments for the oppressive rulers of Kazakhstan and China.  In Baghdad, the city where Hadid was born, she entered the competition to design a new parliament for Iraq, which was won by an emerging London practice, Assemblage. The former British minister Lord Howarth, a member of the competition jury, calls the latter's plans  the product of rigorous thought  and  becoming for an institution replacing a dictatorship ,  rather than a grandiose and egotistic flourish . Hadid's entry has been called  convoluted , but her failure to win the competition did not stop her office continuing to talk to parliamentary officials, in the apparent hope that she will be awarded the project after all. If so, this would be a reversal of her treatment at Cardiff, and something with which she should have nothing to do.  Behind these stories questions recur: does her success, her associations with the mighty, her splendour, mean that she is losing touch with the complexities and contradictions that were once part of her work? Is she now in danger of favouring the spectacular to the exclusion of the dirty realities of cities, in which she used to profess an interest? If she has been dominating generous, and grand earthy, is the first half of each pairing now ascendant?  My own experiences of Zaha Hadid include writing in her support during the Cardiff battles, and following and reviewing her works. I have also been her client twice, or three times if you include a speculative proposal for the rebuilding of the burned-down Teatro Fenice in Venice, which I helped commission for a newspaper.  The first time was when I was editor of Blueprint magazine, and we collaborated with the constructional trade show Interbuild to realise a Zaha-designed pavilion in the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham. It was to be paid for partly by Blueprint advertisers, whose products would be incorporated into the structure, and a tricky moment came when she presented her designs to them. Her explanations were obscure to this sceptical audience, and when she finished an awkward silence fell. The pavilion seemed doomed, but then a northern voice broke out  2013  I think it's bloody brilliant   2013 and its owner, the head of the high-quality toilet cubicle company Thrislington, led a round of applause. The other advertisers had to join in, and then write the necessary cheques.  The pavilion was built, not without difficulty or busted budgets, as it required a kind of steel-frame construction more suitable for small bridges than a week-long trade show. But Interbuild, Blueprint and the advertisers got their publicity, for achieving what was in 1995 Zaha's first structure in Britain. And it was a memorable thing, putting into the shade a classical hut that Prince Charles's architectural institute erected next door.  The last time was when the Architecture Foundation, of which I was director, ran a competition to design a new building to house its activities. Zaha Hadid won, and another meeting gathered in her office, in the same room where Patrick Wilson, the Thrislington man, had won the day. This time it held the many consultants who would help get the building built, who were there to learn about and be enthused by the project on which we were embarking. Hadid wandered in and out, while her project architect attempted an explanation of the designs, occasionally telling him from the doorway that he was doing it wrong.  It was not an auspicious start, and after three years, many sleepless nights and some hair loss, the project was abandoned. We experienced the same impatience with practical constraints that she had shown on the Frankfurt flight  2013 the cafe would not be easily heatable in the winter, the window-cleaning bill equalled the salary of a member of staff of this small organisation, the project architect turned up at a meeting called to cut costs with a redesigned staircase that would increase them. At the same time she and her office showed dedication, working long hours to address problems, producing an entirely new design when necessary, and dealing with frustrations not of their making. As clients, it should be said, we at the Architecture Foundation had our own imperfections.  We were not alone among Hadid's clients in facing practical challenges  2013 the Aquatics Centre, for example, uses prodigious quantities of steel, which dented London 2012's pride in using the material economically on their stadium, and coped awkwardly with the need to have temporary additions to house the seating required during Games time. But nor are such challenges unique or new among celebrated architects. Early houses by Richard Rogers were cold, damp and or nightmarish to build. The functional shortcomings of Le Corbusier's and Frank Lloyd Wright's works are legendary. Andrea Palladio's church of Il Redentore in Venice, consecrated in 1592, was seven times over budget and had poor acoustics. As choral music was one of its functions, the latter was a serious fault, but it is still seen as a masterpiece.  Patrik Schumacher has even addressed this question of practicality as part of the practice's philosophy.  Functional optimality,  he wrote,  is 2026 renounced in favour of the experimental advancement of social practices of potentially higher functionality.  This seems to say that, if you have to choose between firing someone and having dirty windows, it's worth it, because at some point in the future Hadid's architecture will lead to a better world. It is almost religious: sacrifices now for reward in the hereafter.  Such sacrifices are infuriating to other architects who try responsibly to avoid them, but sometimes they are indeed worth it. If we had got her Architecture Foundation building built it would have been a permanent addition to London's stock of extraordinary places, and we would all have felt good about it. For cultural institutions there can often be a trade-off, in that the spectacle and celebrity of a Hadid building brings benefits of fundraising and publicity that can help pay for costs in cash and neuralgesics.  Pippo Ciorra is the senior curator of architecture at Maxxi, the museum of contemporary art that Zaha designed in Rome. He acknowledges that it was  very expensive , but says that Hadid was the right choice for the project when she won the competition in 1998. It was  the outcome of a season of optimism  in Italy in the late 1990s, when the government of Romano Prodi promoted cultural innovation.  Then everything went wrong,  says Ciorra, but at the time it was  necessary to have hope . The building finally opened in 2010, after a tortuous gestation and in a very different Italy.  The building is in essence a series of concrete tubes, writhing and overlapping, which connect an external courtyard to the internal exhibition galleries in what aspires to be a continuous flow of space. It is dynamic, in what was a sleepy district, with long curving interiors accelerated by longitudinal fins in the ceilings. It is modern baroque in an old-baroque city.  It is more and more successful,  says Ciorra.  People like to come and enjoy this public space, to take advantage of it.   It is, he adds,  really incredibly well built 2026 Immense attention was poured on it. There were dozens of models made, and it didn't lose anything in the transition from the design to the finished building.  He also opposes the most common criticism of Maxxi, which is that it is a poor place for displaying exhibits, that the construction dominates the content.  It works well  for the architecture exhibitions that Ciorra mounts, and he likes the fact that it creates no boundaries between art and architecture shows. It is  a little more challenging for art curators, but they are getting better.  The secret is to be bold,  not to pay too much respect to the place 2026 in the beginning they were too shy.   Maxxi fulfils many of the promises of the first part of Hadid's career. It is powerful, distinctive, spectacular and displays her ability, evident in the Peak, of conceiving complex spaces in three dimensions. More importantly, it contains ideas about cities and public life, also evident in the Cardiff project. According to Aaron Betsky, Hadid's work is about  the gathering together and bundling of the energy inherent in a site and situation , and  the intensities that come from condensing things then opening up. At best it is intensely democratic, about removing barriers.   Through her architecture she has sought to create new and heightened relationships between the inner and outer lives of her buildings, between the contents of an opera house or an art gallery, and the streets outside. At Cardiff the audience would themselves have become performers, as they moved through a sequence of external spaces and internal foyers. In Rome she made a three-dimensional passeggiata that fuses an old city and new art. Critics of Hadid have always accused her of making extraordinary shapes for the sake of it, to which she responded by saying that they were means to the end of creating new urban experiences, as at Maxxi. According to Schumacher, the purpose is to  reflect emerging social demands .  With some of the more recent work, however, this defence is harder to make. The CMA CGM tower in Marseille and the Roca showroom in London look very much like shape-making for its own sake, with multiple curves that have little purpose but to create an updated version of a 1960s vision of what the future was going to look like. In the glimpses so far possible of the Serpentine Sackler, Hadid's undulating, tent-like addition joins the old gunpowder store clumsily. Some hidden intelligence might be revealed when it is opened, but for now its curves seem lumpy and overwrought, earthbound rather than floating.  It would be surprising if Ilham Aliyev, ruler of Azerbaijan, has much interest in Schumacher's  emerging social demands , or in reflecting them in the Heydar Aliyev centre, which is named after his father and immediate predecessor as president. From a distance of a few thousand miles this building looks extraordinary, with almost every surface, inside and out, being both white and curving, offering an experience of total immersion in Zaha-ness. But it doesn't look like a work of the democratic urban energy of which Betsky speaks. Rather, it seems an exercise in isolated magnificence not so different from the colossal cultural palaces long beloved of Soviet and similar regimes  2013 it is just that the giant Asiatic-classical columns that they would once have used have been traded for futurist swooshes.  Nor does her Galaxy Soho building in Beijing, which has upset the preservationists, fulfil her practice's promise that its projects  work in synchronicity with their surroundings . Huge, bulbous and uniform, it looms menacingly over neighbouring hutongs, the streets and alleys bordered by courtyard houses that are characteristic of old Beijing. This menace is actual as well as metaphorical, as similar streets were obliterated to make way for Galaxy Soho.  During the land acquisition process,  says the Beijing Cultural Heritage Protection Centre,  the legal rights of the original hutong residents were also grossly disregarded.  Walking in and around it, the experience is not of flow but of disconnection, of a space station descended on the city.  The architect Sean Griffiths is one of several of Hadid's fellow professionals who question her work, but he is more outspoken than most.  It's basically an empty vessel,  he says,  that sucks in whatever ideology might be in proximity to it. In Moscow in 1923 it might have been interesting, but in the age of hyperventilating global capitalism, that's what gets sucked in.  Another architect calls her current designs  commodified images of progress . Looking at the projects in Baku and Beijing, it's hard to disagree.  Even a supporter, Pippo Ciorra of Maxxi, doubts that Hadid can still be seen as ahead of her time. Her style, he says,  is a glorious prolongation of the 20th century , whereas now younger architects  work for the future in a different way . They profess interest in the environment, for example, about which  Zaha doesn't give a shit . He also questions what he calls the  industrial  methods of design her practice now uses  2013 its huge output means that the close personal attention she gave Maxxi is no longer possible on every project. The production line of city centres and cultural monuments tends to create projects that look like parodies of the Zaha Hadid style, hard to distinguish from the increasingly large number of imitations by lesser firms. It is a particular feature of her approach, of the idea she embodies of architect-as-artist, that it relies heavily on the intensity of her individual creativity, which works less well when it is diluted.  Partly, this is a phenomenon that often comes when pioneering architects achieve success. It is probably humanly impossible to continue to invest the effort and emotional energy that goes into the early work. It could be argued that it is better to employ talent and experience on dozens of buildings, than on a few agonisingly crafted masterpieces, even if this disappoints fans from the days before the star in question was so famous. Norman Foster has made this trade-off as, to a lesser extent, has Frank Gehry.  I'd also say that there is still some X-factor, some oomph, that sets almost any Hadid project apart from the copyists. I am fully expecting her Aquatics Centre, for example, to be one of the greatest places in London in which to swim, even if its new-look exterior is a bit ponderous.  But it is hard to escape the feeling that she has become a prisoner of her grandeur. She and her work now seem to inhabit a bubble of celebrity, with a decreasing connection to the rest of the world. The bubble is sustained by often uncritical media: when the BBC made an Imagine programme about her, they managed not to air any of the controversies raised by Baku, Beijing and Baghdad, but presented her purely as a great creative talent.  The Serpentine Gallery, meanwhile, is not a neophyte among Hadid's admirers. She has been a long serving trustee of the gallery, and designed the first of its annual series of temporary pavilions, in 2000. It says that since then  it had always been the intention 2026 to commission a permanent structure for the gallery by Zaha. This presented an unrivalled opportunity to realise a ZHA landmark building in central London.  She was appointed for the project without a design competition which, although it is unusual for organisations such as the Serpentine, it was entitled to do.  Entitled, but not wise  2013 there are many architects more obviously suited to a small-scale addition to an historic building, but its awe and desire for a  landmark  seems to have dazzled an organisation usually sure-footed in its appointment of architects. By failing to look outside its loop of admiration, and by playing her out of position, it has done neither itself nor her any favours.  And, visiting the showroom and archive in Clerkenwell, which will eventually require a museum building to house it, I am struck by the disappearance of a sense of scale. Scale is something that connects an object to something outside itself; without it what is left is the Zaha look, the Zaha brand, that can be digitally expanded or reduced to suit the size of a project.  Hadid remains ahead of her time, and responsive to emerging social demands, in the sense that the world is becoming a series of concentrations of wealth and power, which express themselves through lavish, singular trophies. To this extent there is a reality to the work. But it is different from the ideals she used to express, or of her achievements at their best. There has always been conflict, or tension, between her artistic ego and her public spirit, which is what made her interesting, but it's getting hard to see the latter. Summary: From the Olympic Aquatics Centre to a new Serpentine gallery, from Beijing to Baku, Zaha Hadid's buildings are everywhere. But she divides opinion: she's a genius, say some, but to critics she has lost touch with her original ideals. By Rowan Moore",

The partnership  201cwill incorporate Yelp 2019s listings and reviews of local businesses into results on Yahoo 2019s search engine, 201d according to the Wall Street Journal .  The surprising part of this announcement is not that Yahoo partnered with Yelp; it 2019s who Yahoo did not partner with: Foursquare. Speculation about a Foursquare data partnership with Yahoo has been a popular topic of late.  But the news of Yahoo teaming up with Yelp, not Foursquare, puts this speculation to rest. Yahoo probably doesn 2019t need two location data partnerships.  Yelp and Foursquare are competitors; the biggest differentiator is that Foursquare, which was founded in 2009, is a mobile-first company. Yelp, which started in 2004 and went public in 2012, has had to transition its business over to mobile to meet the shift in traffic. Almost 60% of Yelp 2019s search queries are now mobile.  The other big difference between the two is that Yelp has figured out how to make a lot of money from local business owners faster than Foursquare.  Foursquare is working hard to catch up  2014 the company now has six streams of revenue, according to a spokesperson: venue claims, in which a business owner pays $20 to get control over his venue 2019s account; promoted search results; promoted  201cExplore 201d results; ads that are shown after a person checks in at a venue; a self-serve ad platform, where venues can buy ads independently; and data partnerships. Currently Microsoft and data clearinghouse Gnip are Foursquare 2019s two clients for that offering.

He 2019s right to: Foursquare has collected a trove of data, through 5 billion check-ins within its own app, as well as data points from its 50,000 API partners like Instagram that use Foursquare 2019s location database. Location data is valuable  2014 look no further than Google 2019s GOOG $1 billion acquisition of traffic app Waze last year for proof. And last year Apple AAPL bought three local mapping apps: one called Embark, another called Locationary, and subway mapping site HopStop.  Last week, Microsoft MSFT said it found Foursquare 2019s data valuable enough to pay for and invest in. The companies announced that Foursquare location data would show up in Microsoft 2019s Windows Phone and Bing search results. The news was a reminder that, aside from boosting its valuation, data could be a big business for Foursquare, which has struggled to monetize as it matures. (The company brought in just $2 million in revenue in 2012; reports vary over whether it hit revenue expectations of $20 million last year.)  Foursquare was once New York 2019s hottest tech company, and it commanded a frothy valuation to match. The company 2019s challenge of living up to the hype and the valuation have been well-documented: Last Spring the company raised $41 million in debt to avoid taking a down-round. The recent investment from Microsoft, which was added on to a $35 million Series D round of funding led by DFJ Growth and the Capital Group 2019s Smallcap World Fund, valued the company at $650 million, a small step up from its $600 million valuation three years ago.  It 2019s not clear why Yahoo chose Yelp over Foursquare, though a person familiar with Foursquare says the startup walked away because Yahoo was not interested in the strategic investment part of the deal. And the Foursquare-Microsoft data partnership is not exclusive, so Foursquare could theoretically revisit the topic with Yahoo. Still, this partnership seemed like an easy layup for Foursquare. And at this point, the company needs to make every shot it gets. Summary: The media wanted a Yahoo-Foursquare deal more than the companies did.",

If other 19th-century composers had tried to elevate or ennoble the concerto, Strauss seems to be reminding us of the unalloyed pleasures of shameless, featherweight virtuosity. The music 2019s underlying impish spirit would find wider renown when channeled into the merry pranks of a certain German folk character, but Till Eulenspiegel 2019s nose-thumbing antics are already present in the scampering runs and keyboard gymnastics of the  201cBurleske. 201d  Pianist Emanuel Ax is back this week in Symphony Hall, and he played the  201cBurleske 201d on Thursday night with skill and gusto under the baton of Christoph von Dohnanyi. In this score, piano and timpani are often co-conspirators, a partnership that once helped kindle Ax 2019s own fantasy of learning to play the timpani himself (which he ultimately did). On Thursday, Timothy Genis handled his part in the collaboration with elegance and precision.  The night began with more Strauss: the gorgeous opening string sextet written for his final opera,  201cCapriccio, 201d completed in 1941 and premiered the following year under politically fraught circumstances in wartime Munich. Now at the other end of his career, some five decades after the youthful  201cBurleske, 201d Strauss seems here to have inverted his maxim about the outer-directedness of art. One hears in this introverted music of soft radiance, the sound of a composer cocooning himself in retrospection and autumnal beauty.  201cCapriccio 201d takes place in the year 1777, and as the curtain goes up, the opera 2019s own characters are listening to this music. If the past is another country, Strauss was ready for a visit.  Six BSO string players, among them concertmaster Malcolm Lowe and three principals, gave the sextet a warm-toned and sensitive reading on Thursday night. Tellingly, after the wistful lambent music of the sextet 2019s closing bars played out, a large audience in the hall allowed for a few seconds of silence before jumping in with applause  2014 always a good sign that the music has reached its mark.  Offsetting the Strauss selections were two Mozart works: the Piano Concerto No. 14 (again with Ax) and the  201cHaffner 201d Symphony. Dohnanyi had the violins seated antiphonally, and led clear-eyed and thoughtful accounts with just a few rough edges. Ax 2019s tone in the concerto was full and ripe, and he conveyed the vitality and sparkle of the finale particularly well. In the closing pages of the  201cHaffner, 201d Dohnanyi played up the dynamic contrasts to striking effect. It was presumably just a taste of what 2019s to come: Next week he leads a program solely devoted to the composer 2019s final three symphonies.   2022 BLO season will feature Puccini, Glass, Massenet, Leh 00e1r   2022 Betty Buckley on her signature song and new album Summary: The Boston Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Christoph von Dohnanyi and featuring guest pianist Emanuel Ax, played works by Richard Strauss and Mozart at Symphony Hall on Thursday.",

The medium as intersection of art and technology are on display at the MIT Museum (a fitting location) in  201cImages of Discovery: Communicating Science Through Photography. 201d The show runs through March 1 of next year.   201cImages of Discovery 201d consists of work from three photographers associated with MIT: Harold  201cDoc 201d Edgerton, who was a much-beloved figure on campus for many decades; Berenice Abbott, who spent time at MIT in the  201950s working on the photographic visualization of science; and Felice Frankel, who 2019s affiliated with the university 2019s Center for Materials Science and Engineering.  The show has another notable element: a half dozen interactive stations where museumgoers can create digital versions of the sorts of images seen in the gallery. It 2019s a striking way to get across how these three photographers combined experimentation and artistic creativity. It 2019s hard to predict who 2019ll enjoy the stations more: kids or their parents.  Through his development of stroboscopic photography, Edgerton produced some of the most striking images in the history of the medium. Several of them are among the most familiar, such as the  201ccoronet 201d produced by a drop of milk. It like a pearly crown of creation. That photograph is in the show (we learn that Edgerton chose milk because it photographed better than water), as is a less familiar image in the series, with the displaced milk forming a spout.   201cBullet through Balloons 201d echoes Edgerton 2019s more famous image of a bullet bursting an apple.  201cHammer Breaks Plate Glass 201d turns an act of destruction into one of aesthetic purity.  201cWater From a Faucet 201d effects a different sort of transformation: giving liquid the appearance of solidity as a swirling crystal  2014 assuming, that is, crystal ever swirled. That 2019s the essence of what Edgerton did: upending our visual expectations and making us see the world differently.  In a nice curatorial touch, an Edgerton photograph of bursting soap bubbles hangs by one Abbott took in which they look so solid as to seem unburstable. A wall label tells us that Abbott took many exposures over the course three days or longer to get the image just right since  201cmost of them came out mushy. 201d  Mushiness, either personal or visual, is about the last word one would associate with Abbott. Where Edgerton 2019s photographs take the mundane and produce something (seemingly) miraculous, Abbott 2019s aim was to take scientific principles and concepts  2014 interference patterns, the conservation of momentum, refraction, magnetism  2014 and make them visible. The same exacting eye she had brought to her portrait work in Paris during the  201920s and documenting of New York cityscapes during the  201930s she brought to science. A photograph like  201cLight Passes through a Prism 201d is at once superbly illustrative and supremely elegant. Is it art? Is it science? Yes.  Unlike Edgerton and Abbott, Frankel works in color. Some of her most vivid images show materials invisible to the naked eye  2014 so much so as to be almost invisible to comprehension. Ferrofluids, for example, are particles just nanometers in length suspended in fluids. Or there 2019s the laser etching on silicon chips necessary to enable microelectromechanical systems.  As with what Edgerton and Abbott show us, these images are so startling (and so often beautiful) that seeing almost isn 2019t believing. It 2019s learning. Summary: In  201cImages of Discovery, 201d at MIT, Harold Edgerton, Berenice Abbott, and Felice Frankel put photography at the service of science.",

But the crop extracts a staggering price, consuming more water than all the showering, dish-washing, and other indoor household water use of California 2019s 39 million people. As California enters its fourth year of drought, almonds are  2018 2018the poster child of all things bad in water, 2019 2019 grower Bob Weimer said. Almond trees cover nearly 1 million acres in California. Since each nut requires a gallon of water, almonds are consuming 1.07 trillion gallons annually in the state, one-fifth more than California families use indoors. So when Governor Jerry Brown ordered water consumption cut 25 percent but exempted farms, almonds got toasted in the debate that followed.  201cThe tomato growers use a lot more water than we do. You should go after those guys, 2019 2019 said Ryon Paton, who is a principal of Trinitas Partners. In all, agriculture uses 80 percent of the water Californians draw but produces just 1.5 percent of the state 2019s gross domestic product, said Christopher Thornberg, an economist.  2014 ASSOCIATED PRESS  HONG KONG  2014 In the latest sign economic growth may be slowing faster than anticipated, China on Sunday freed up roughly $200 billion for new lending. The central bank sharply reduced the amount of money banks must keep on reserve, a stimulus measure to pump more money into the economy. But the move comes as China 2019s securities regulator is trying to curtail new debt-driven investments in the country 2019s frothy stock market. Overall economic growth is slipping, which argues for looser monetary policy. But the country 2019s stock markets are soaring, driven by inexperienced new investors and rising levels of borrowing in order to bet on shares. On Friday, the securities regulator moved to curtail the funding for buying stocks on borrowed money. That gave the central bank room to free up broader monetary policy by reducing the chances that new bank funding would find its way into the stock market. Still, the cut does not automatically translate into lending. China 2019s banks have grown wary of issuing loans to smaller or riskier borrowers, given the country 2019s slowing growth.  2014 NEW YORK TIMES Summary: Technology  Raytheon may buy Websense for $1.9b  NEW YORK  2014 Raytheon Co.",

The HondaJet started its world tour in Japan this week, reports The Wall Street Journal. It seats seven people and will start deliveries in a few months, and is designed for use as a business jet.  This is the first time the HondaJet is flying outside of the U.S., where much of the development has taken place. The fuel-efficient jet will go to five more airports in Japan including Sendai, Kobe, and Narita over the next two weeks where it will have demonstration flights. Afterwards, it will go to Europe including Switzerland, Britain, France and Belgium for demonstration flights. The jet is still waiting final approval from the FAA for deliveries, but it has already won approval for flying.  One interesting factoid: in designing the nose of the aircraft, [Honda Aircraft Company CEO Michimasa] Fujino says he was inspired by a Ferragamo high-heeled shoe he saw at a duty free shop during a trip to Hawaii.

            "input": "text:Trans Worlds Airlines' president C. Edwin Meyer Jr. said yesterday that he had dropped two senior vice presidents to reduce costs and that the airline's managerial staff would be further reduced, at least somewhere.  Mr. Meyer said he had dismissed thw two vice presidents, Donald Casey and Robin Wilson, out of a conviction that T.W.A.  must be trimmer and more cost efficient.  Their base pay was $140,000 and $125,000 a year, respectively. Mr. Carey oversaw marketing, Mr.Wilson, operations.  The New York-based Trans World Corporation, the airlines's parent company, had a loss of $57.5 million in this year's first quarter, compared with $49.3 million, compared with $59 million in the 1980 quarter.  Explaining the abolition of the two executive's jobs, Mr. Meyer said that, within T.W.A. he had been  looking around and demanding of other people that they reduce their fixed staffs, saying we can't support that same level.  He continued,  And as I kept making those speeches I finally had to come back to my office one day and say to myseld, 'Ed, can you run your ortfit a little more efficiently and maybe work a little harder and do away with some people?'   Mr. Meyer denied suggestions by some Wall Street analysts that he had let the two men go because of dissatisfaction with their performance or because he wanted to improve himself more directly in operating the airline. The two men were considered possible eventual successors to Mr. Meyer, who is 52 years old.  Asked how many other executives might be dropped, Mr. Meyer said he did not know. But he added that reviews would be made of where additional managers might be pared from the staff. The airline has already reduced its payroll by 5,000 within two and a half years, to 32,000 employees.   I'm asking everybody to go back and take a look  at where further economies can beachieved, Mr. Meyer went on, adding: Sitting at the top, I don't know wherewe can do without and still run a good airline; the managers of this airlind down the line do know that, and I've got to motivate them to do it.   He sid he did not plan any reductions in the staff at less-than-executive levels in the month to come. But he emphasized that in forthcoming union negotiations he would be pressing for productivity increases.  In that connection, he said he had read with interest a long report about the airline industry by Robert J. Joedicke, a first vice president and airline analyst at Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb. Entitled,  The Goose That Laid Golden Eggs,  it was published in February and has been widely disseminatied.  The Joedicke report emphasized the improtance of large, older airlines' increasing productivity to hold down their unit cost in order to be competitive with newer, nonunion airlines.   He's brought things into very clear focus,  Mr. Meyer sid, and he added, speaking of himself and the heads of other large, unioized airlines:  We're all singing out of the same hymnals, telling our labor forces that we've got more productivity. And I'm trying to say that the management is going to be moving to set an example.  Summary: Trans Worlds Airlines' president C.

            "input": "text:By Christopher Lehmann-Haupt THE MAPMAKERS. By John Noble Wil- ford. 414 pages. Illustrated. Knopf. $20.  DESPITE everything, we were all a little amazed. First John H. Glenn, when he looked down and saw ''the whole state of Florida'' near the end of his earth orbit in 1962; then subsequent astronauts; then the rest of us when we saw the first photography from space - we were all a little amazed. The earth looked just like a map; they had gotten it right! And though even the dumbest among us knew the approximate answer when we stopped to think about it, there was part of all of us that exclaimed: How did they know? How on earth did they know?  That is the question John Noble Wilford tries to answer comprehensively in ''The Mapmakers.'' How did they know? The answer, of course, is basically triangulation, or the surveying technique of establishing the relative position of the apex of a triangle by measuring the length of the baseline and the angles to the apex. Ptolemy Helped, Too  But there was more to it than that. There was the job of establishing such first principles as the notion of comprehending and measuring the universe and of representing it on a map. As usual, the Chinese got good at it first, but the Greeks worked it out for Western purposes. A second-century (A.D) Egyptian named Claudius Ptolemy helped too, even if he did think the Earth was the center of the universe. Also useful was a 16th-century German named Gerardus Mercator, who squared the circle by figuring out a way to project the spherical world onto a flat surface.  Then there was the donkeywork -exploring, discovering and surveying, endlessly surveying. Men died surveying, and also got mosquito-bitten. The rest of the story is pretty much technology - progressing from a wheel whose revolutions you counted so as to measure distance, to a laser beam bounced off distant mirrors at calculable intervals of time. That's the story of mapmaking in a nutshell.  Mr. Wilford, who is science correspondent for The New York Times, where he has covered all the major space explorations, doesn't try to tell the story in a nutshell. Instead, he makes his way at a leisurely and detailed pace. He starts around the time that Eratosthenes, an Alexandrian librarian of the third century B.C., tried to figure out the circumference of the globe from a sundial, missed by only 16 percent, and thus became the father of geodesy, the science of earth measurement. He ends with the incredible story of the mapping of Mars.  In between, there is something for everybody - gadgetry for the technically avid, the story of the clandestine survey of forbidden Tibet, for admirers of human intrepidness. For collectors of unlikely facts, there is news that there seem to be lakes beneath the Antarctic ice sheet, containing water melted by heat flowing up from the earth's interior. For those who wonder if maps ever lead to discovery instead of vice versa, there is an account how the mapping of the great Mid-Ocean Ridge led to confirmation of Alfred Wegener's theory of Continental Drift. Of Human Perseverance  My own preference in ''The Mapmakers'' was for the stories of human perseverance - explorers in the Age of Discovery nosing about for the Northwest Passage; the 18th-century Frenchmen who suffered disastrous expeditions to learn whether Isaac Newton was right in calling the planet Earth an oblate spheroid; the Cassini family, who mapped France and took four generations to complete the job. I got a little bogged down in the later stages of ''The Mapmakers,'' where Mr. Wilford takes up such matters as isolines, the difference between geometric and dynamic geodesy, the uses of Doppler positioning and John P. Snyder's mathematical equations for Alden P. Colvocoresses' Space Oblique Mercator Projection, known in mapmaking circles as Colvo's Projection.  But these matters will no doubt be meat for anyone who happens to be more interested in where mapmaking is headed than in where it's come from. The way it looks to me is that if the computers and the people who feed them get any more resourceful, they are not only going to provide us with a photograph of the whole earth - one with all faces exposed simultaneously - they are also going to end up building a full-scale model of the planet.  We can probably use one.  Illustrations: Photo of John Noble Wilford Summary: By Christopher Lehmann-Haupt THE MAPMAKERS. By John Noble Wil- ford. 414 pages. Illustrated. Knopf. $20.

            "input": "text:ATHENS 2014 With pink carnations, revolutionary songs and promises of change, Andreas Papandreou and his opposition Panhellenic Socialist Movement held a pre-election victory party here recently.  Several days later, Prime Minister George Rallis took a triumphal train tour through the Peloponnesus, preaching progress through stability with the governing New Democracy Party and warning against the Marxist alternative.  Although no date has been set for Greece's general elections, which must be held by November, the campaign is already under way and promises to be a close and bitter struggle.  ''These elections are crucial because for the first time, a nonbourgeois, Marxist party has challenged the establishment and has a chance of winning,'' said a source close to President Constantine Caramanlis, a conservative.  Western diplomats also show concern over the strong neutralist tendencies of the Socialist Movement, its threats to take Greece out of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Common Market and its opposition to American bases here.  At this point, however, independent political experts make no predictions because developments could change the electoral picture radically between now and the fall, when the voting is most likely to take place. They point out that while Mr. Papandreou's party is ahead in the polls, a large percentage of the electorate is still undecided.  Even if the Socialist Movement won, the realities of governing would probably not permit any major foreign policy changes, according to long-time observers. They point out that the party would probably not get a majority in Parliament and would have to form a minority government or a coalition with the smaller center parties.  Mr. Papandreou has prudently avoided committing himself on what he would do if he won, clearly hoping to keep his leftist, anti-American constituency while not frightening away the essentially pro-Western center. Alludes to Father's Strategy  ''We believe we will win a majority, but even if we get a simple plurality, we could push for new elections,'' Mr. Papandreou said, in an allusion to the precedent set by his late father.  Prime Minister George Papandreou's Center Union won a narrow victory in 1963 and forced new elections several months later, winning a majority and breaking the 12-year monopoly of power by the conservatives. It was, however, his leftist program and his son's radical policies that led to the military dictatorship from 1967 to 1974.  The old radicalism was still very much alive in the Socialist Movement's ''victory'' celebration offered by Socialist trade unions in a downtown restaurant.  With Mikis Theodorakis's music in the background, Mr. Papandreou delighted the crowd with traditional Greek dances and fiery oratory. He predicted that his party would sweep to power like ''an avalanche'' and denounced the governing right as ''spokesman for the oligarchy'' and ''guarantor of the foreign powers that have regulated the life of this country since 1821,'' the year that Greece's war of independence from the Ottoman Empire began. Attacks Market Entry  The 62-year-old Socialist leader called Greece's entry into the Common Market ''an enormous historical mistake,'' attacked the Government's recent return to NATO and warned that he would accuse the administration of treason if it agreed to the presence of American bases here ''without gaining guarantees of Greek rights in the Aegean and the sovereign rights of Cyprus.''  Nevertheless, in an interview later in his home in an Athens suburb, Mr. Papandreou emphasized that the Socialist Movement was a responsible party and would act accordingly if and when it came to power. While he said its ''strategic aim'' was a nonaligned Greece, occupying a position like Sweden, Yugoslavia or Austria, he stressed that he wanted to maintain close relations with the West.  ''We're not against the E.E.C.,'' he said, ''but we believe membership will be economically disastrous for Greece, and we would like a special agreement similar to the one with Yugoslavia.'' He acknowledged, however, that since Greece formally joined the European Economic Community on Jan. 1, it would be difficult to get out. Opposes Foreign Bases  The Socialist leader said that his party was against all foreign bases here and that the American bases represented ''more of a danger than a protection'' for Greece. He said, however, that since the Government wanted the bases, it should at least use them as a bargaining point to obtain guarantees from the United States and NATO on the balance of forces in the Aegean.  Like most other Greeks on both the left and the right, Mr. Papandreou considers that the ''one threat'' to Greece is Turkey and what is perceived as its challenge to the Greek position in the Aegean.  Recent opinion polls have consistently shown the Socialist Movement with about 31 percent of the electorate, compared to 21 percent for the New Democracy Party. But Mr. Papandreou acknowledged that there was a large number of undecided voters and that there could be a shift.  The principal issue in the election will be the economy, according to Mr. Papandreou, a former economics professor at the University of California at Berkeley. He predicted that the inflation rate would be 30 percent by fall and that the Government would be ''bankrupt.''  Government leaders feel confident that they have defused the opposition on foreign policy issues by reaching agreements with NATO and the Common Market, and they hope they will conclude an agreement with the United States on the bases by the end of March.

            "input": "text:OWINGS MILLS, Md., Dec. 21 2014 Frank Kush, discharged as Arizona State's football coach two years ago after the university administration had joined in accusations that he had punched a player and then lied to cover up the assault, was named head coach of the Baltimore Colts today. He replaced Mike McCormack, who was dismissed after compiling a 2-14 record this season, his second at Baltimore.  ''Mike is a good man,'' said the Colts' general manager, Dick Szymanski. ''I'm sorry to see him leave, but it's the bottom line, wins and losses.''  At a news conference at the team's training camp here, Szymanski said that Kush, who is 52, had agreed to a five-year contract. The signing came nine months after a state jury in Phoenix voted in Kush's favor against a harassment suit brought by Kevin Rutledge, the Arizona State player he was accused of having assaulted.  McCormack,51, who took over from Ted Marchibroda at the end of the 1979 season, had a 9-23 record during his two years with the Colts. His dismissal came a day after the club, in its last game of the year, had broken a 14-game losing streak by defeating the New England Patriots, 23-21.  McCormack, who compiled a 16-25-1 record during three years at Philadelphia before spending four seasons as offensive coordinator at Cincinnati, issued a statement that said he was disappointed in the decision of Robert Irsay, the Colts' owner.  ''But at the same time, it has been a season of disappointment,'' McCormack said, ''and I fully understand the reason for his action.'' Kush, after a hiatus of one year from coaching, returned this season as coach of the Canadian Football League's Hamilton Tiger-Cats, who were 11-4-1.  At Arizona State, he had produced winning seasons in 20 of his 21 years, and his 176 career victories placed him second to Paul (Bear) Bryant of Alabama among active coaches of major college teams. But the university dismissed him in 1979 after the administration had accused him of lying, and encouraging his assistants to lie, in an attempt to conceal an assault on Rutledge in a fit of rage on the sideline during a game the previous season.  By the time Kush was discharged -with a $200,000 severance settlement -Rutledge had filed his $2.2 million suit against the coach and others responsible for administering Arizona State's athletic program. Kush maintained repeatedly that he had neither attempted a cover-up nor punched Rutledge, and the player ultimately lost the court battle.  Still pending against Kush in Arizona is a defamation suit brought by Rick Lynch, a former drag-strip operator who is an Arizona State booster. The suit cites a newspaper article, published 10 days after Kush had been dismissed, that quoted the coach as saying that Mr. Lynch had played a role in the discharge.  Today's announcement by the Colts came one day after the National Football League had confirmed that it had conducted an investigation to determine if Kush was suitable to coach in the league.  The inquiry was first made public by The Boston Globe, which said it was carried out last month by private investigators hired by the N.F.L.  ''We have been asked by clubs to update us on Frank Kush's situation regarding the litigation that he has been involved in,'' said Jim Heffernan, the league's director of public relations. ''We have made such an investigation and reported back to any club that has made an inquiry.''  Kush told reporters today that his conscience was clear. ''I've not done anything that I am embarrassed about,'' he said. ''I'm going to continue to coach the way I've been coaching.'' Kush said he had asked for a five-year contract to give him sufficient time to establish a winning football team. ''If I can't do it in that period of time,'' he said, ''I ought to be gone.'' McCormack had one year left on his three-year contract. Kush's three-year agreement with Hamilton contained a clause allowing him to terminate the contract at any time. Summary: Frank Kush, discharged as Arizona State's football coach two years ago after the university administration had joined in accusations that he had punched a player and then lied to cover up the assault, was named head coach of the Baltimore Colts today.

Barbara Gamarekian Summary: Monday   The main focus in Washington early this week will again be on the Senate as it continues its historic debate on whether to expel Senator Harrison A. Williams Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, because of his conviction on charges growing out of the Abscam investigation.  The deciding vote could come as early as Tuesday and Senator Alan Cranston, Democrat of California, may well move at that point to reduce the penalty from expulsion to censure.   Also on the Senate agenda this week is more debate, and possibly a final vote, on the Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1981, which would make it a crime to publicly identify an American intelligence agent.   For President Reagan, who is to return from his California ranch late today, there will be a number of important meetings this week, starting Tuesday when he goes to Capitol Hill to lunch with Republicans and try to dispel concern about his budget proposals. He also meets Tuesday with Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany to discuss NATO and European security.",

            "input": "text:RICHMOND, April 10 2014 Gov. Charles S. Robb has signed legislation declaring a moratorium until July 1,1983, on the issuing of uranium mining permits in Virginia.  The moratorium was sought by environmental groups and municipalities in the central and Piedmont areas of Virginia. They fear that stepped-up exploration and mining under existing laws will damage underground water supplies and threaten public health.  Uranium mining is not conducted in any state east of the Mississippi River, but the Marline Uranium Corporation, a New Yorkbased company, has leased 55,000 acres in Virginia and sunk hundreds of exploratory drill holes in Pittsylvania County, near Danville. In the last two years, the company has spent more than $9 million in its search for the ore deposits.  The legislation that Governor Robb signed Wednesday established a moratorium so that the Legislature would have time to decide what rules were needed to govern uranium mining operations. Company's Opponents Surprised  State statutes do not address reclamation or standards for exploratory mining. Existing laws on mining could largely exempt small excavations and shafts if applied to uranium.  In late December, Marline surprised its local opponents when it announced that it would not seek state mining permits to extract uranium for 18 months.  Company officials have steadfastly maintained that they support strict state controls. But Edward E. Lane, a former Richmond legislator lobbying in behalf of Marline, quietly submitted draft legislation to key legislators last November that proposed to streamline the state's permit procedures.  The Virginia Coal and Energy Commission, which was studying the uranium question, was not informed of the proposed rules. Later, the commission recommended that the Legislature adopt the moratorium.  Despite such maneuvering, Marline officials say they are more concerned with protecting their investment and whether mining will be allowed at all.  Daniel B. Denning, vice president of the company, said in an interview in December, ''It is the question of whether or not uranium development will be allowed at all that is of concern to Marline, and not the enactment of reasonable statutes regulating the industry and protecting the environment.'' Disagree Over Safety Issue  There is little agreement between proponents and opponents of uranium mining operations as to the levels of risk of exposure, nor is there much agreement on how much radiation would be released into the air and ground water by a uranium mining and milling operation.  But a study published in 1971 by the Public Health Service found that lung cancer rates in Colorado uranium miners were five to 25 times the normal rate.  In 1977, Marline geologists began looking in Virginia for areas where low-flying aircraft could pick up radiactive emissions, a possible indication of uranium deposits.  After that, the company quietly acquired uranium leases, mostly in Pittsylvania County but also in Culpeper and Orange counties. 'Cows That Glow Green'  Marline officials have acknowledged they could have done a better job of explaining their intentions to the public. But Mr. Denning maintains that local fears have been greatly exaggerated, especially in largely rural Culpeper and Orange counties, where he said ''there was talk of radiation in the water and cows that glow green.''  Lindsay Gordon, a 59-year-old dairy farmer who has served 12 years on the Orange County Board of Supervisors, has another view. ''We're like babes in the woods, but we like to be careful here,'' he said. ''My daddy told me, 'If you don't know, vote no.' '' Summary: Gov. Charles S.

They began writing songs together and traveling to and from Nashville to hone their craft in the city 2019s famous songwriting rooms in hopes of landing a publishing deal. At 17, they moved to Nashville. The pair say their parents thought they might be going through a phase with this whole songwriting thing.  But if this is a phase, the duo would be wise to stick with it. At 19, Maddie & Tae, as they are known professionally, are the toast of Music City, having conquered the country charts with their cheeky but pointed hit,  201cGirl in a Country Song. 201d With their voices locked in sweet harmony, Maddie & Tae slyly lacerate every lazy bro-country songwriting trope and buzzword, from Daisy Dukes to  201csugar shakers, 201d offering the perspective of all those anonymous women propped like trophies in all those pickup truck cabs and tailgates. When the song, co-written by Marlow, Dye, and Aaron Scherz, hit number one in December, Maddie & Tae became the first female duo in 70 years to achieve that feat with their debut single.  That success rocketed them from playing, as Marlow puts it with a laugh,  201csome lady 2019s garage 201d in Nashville to an opening slot on Dierks Bentley 2019s amphitheater tour, which stops at the Xfinity Center Saturday with fellow warm-up acts Canaan Smith and Kip Moore.  On the phone from a Burgettstown, Pa., stop on the tour, the bubbly pair are still buzzing about the success of  201cGirl, 201d eager to see their current single  2014 the encouraging  201cFly 201d  2014 follow its flight path, and looking forward to the release of their debut album,  201cStart Here, 201d out Aug. 28. (The album will be released by the Big Machine Label Group  2014 home of Taylor Swift  2014 and specifically the imprint Dot Records, which is also releasing Steven Tyler 2019s solo country debut.)   201cWe know that all the stars aligned, 201d says Marlow of their improbable success, not only in the face of their age and inexperience but the current tough row to hoe for female artists trying to crack country radio.  Although making the most of this starry moment meant forgoing college, at least for now, the women believe they are getting exactly the education they need on the road.   201cWe go out and watch Dierks 2019s set, and Kip and Canaan, and we take notes, 201d says Dye.  201cThis is our college and we 2019ve learned so much, so it worked out perfectly. 201d  Bentley, for one, is blown away by how much poise and showmanship Maddie & Tae already exhibit.   201cThey have a full 360-degree show, it 2019s really well done. They play the right cover songs in the right places, they say the right things, they have a great band, 201d says Bentley, who himself is amping up his production for his first big headlining shows.  201cThe first time I saw them [at a festival in Iowa] I sat there just shocked. These girls are not messing around, they came here to stay. 201d  He 2019s also impressed by their songwriting prowess, particularly when it comes to  201cGirl. 201d  201cIt 2019s just fun to hear some girls in there, competing and getting heard, 201d says Bentley.  201cIt 2019s a tough time for them in the genre right now. Girls are actually driving the format but buying guys 2019 songs. So I thought they did a great job of empowering themselves and embracing what 2019s out there and making it their own, with their own twist on it. 201d  Indeed, their own twist is important to Maddie & Tae. So much so that the duo pushed back the release of  201cStart Here 201d from June to August to make sure they personally dotted every i and crossed every t, balancing the demands of the pop-leaning marketplace with their own country influences, which include everyone from the Dixie Chicks to Gene Watson to Vince Gill to Lee Ann Womack. As Marlow says,  201cIf we 2019re in a [songwriting session] and don 2019t really know what to say, we think, How would the Chicks say this? 201d  The album will include the four songs that were previously available on the eponymous EP that featured  201cGirl 201d  2014 including mean-girl comeuppance track  201cSierra 201d and the foot-stomper  201cYour Side of Town 201d  2014 as well as six new tracks, all of which they co-wrote, a major point of pride. They are especially grateful to co-writers like Scherz who took a chance on them, since they are well aware they were a hard sell to some in the veteran Nashville songwriting community.   201cObviously when their publisher called them and said,  2018Hey, do you want to write with two 15-year-old girls who don 2019t live in Nashville yet? 2019 they were probably like,  2018Umm, I 2019m sure they 2019re great but I 2019ll pass, 2019 201d says Dye with a laugh.  201cSo it didn 2019t surprise us that people were skeptical because just looking at it, it does seem that way. But we 2019re so thankful that we did find writers that did believe in us from the beginning. 201d  With Kip Moore, Maddie & Tae, and Canaan Smith  at 7 p.m. Tickets: $34.50-$59.25.

The last day of the month  2013 Tuesday, June 30  2013 will last one second longer than most every other June 30 in history. The reason? Science!  (UTC) is the chronological standard regulating the world's official clocks as well as aviation- and weather-monitoring activities. It must sometimes be adjusted to account for the Earth's irregular rotation.  On Tuesday night, clocks around the world will click from 23:59:59 to 23:59:60 rather than immediately going to midnight on Wednesday.  While awaiting that extra second may be fun for some, it's causing headaches for others. The  the previous leap second, added on June 30,2012, caused major technical hiccups for services such as Mozilla, Reddit, Foursquare, and others, while more than 400 flights had to be grounded in Australia as a result of a resulting problem with Qantas' check-in system.   There are consequences of tinkering with time,  Peter Whibberly, a scientist at Britain's National Physical Laboratory, told the paper.  Because leap seconds are only introduced sporadically, it is difficult to implement them in computers, and mistakes can cause systems to fail temporarily.   , the factors that can affect the Earth's rotation, necessitating a leap second, include earthquakes and temperature changes.  This NASA video explains in more detail how Earth's rotation is measured.  Leap seconds are usually inserted at the midpoints of the year, on June 30 and December 31, according Summary: June 30,2015, may feel slightly longer than it should  2013 and for good reason",

Christos was defending the tennis star after on-court microphones recorded him walking to the net yesterday at the Rogers Cup in Canada and saying to opponent Stan Wawrinka,  Kokkinakis banged your girlfriend. Sorry to tell you that mate .  The comment was an apparent reference to Australian Davis Cup teammate Thanasi Kokkinakis and 19-year-old Croatian tennis player Donna Vekic.  Speaking with the Grill Team, Christos claimed Wawrinka had slandered Kyrgios previously and that he should have expected some retaliatory sledging.  Host Matty Johns was in the process of responding when the interview was suddenly cut short with the hosts apologising that Christos had said  201csomething pretty crook 201d.

More footage has since emerged from the match that captures Kyrgios saying  201che 2019s banging a 19-year-old 201d.  The comments have been widely labelled a disgrace; said to be more damaging to Vekic than to Wawrinka, and contributing to a culture of women being shamed for their sexual behaviour.

A rising tennis star, Vekic has been romantically linked to Wawrinka who separated from his wife Ilham Vuilloud earlier this year. The pair have not publicly confirmed they are dating.  Speaking on court after the match, Kyrgios claimed he had been provoked, saying:  He was getting a bit lippy with me. Kind of in the heat of the moment, I don't know. I just said it.   He later apologised on Facebook writing,  I would like to take this opportunity to apologise for the comments I made during the match last night vs Stan Wawrinka.

He screamed for help, but no one heard.   201cI 2019m going to stay here and die, or crawl myself out, 201d Blake said, recalling the accident.

Not two weeks later, he pronounced himself fully recovered.   201cWell, he 2019s the fastest-healing person I 2019ve ever seen, 201d said his wife, Helen Blake.  About the time the bandages came off, Blake 2019s grandson Adam Blake, cofounder of ThriveHive, asked his grandfather to introduce the marketing company at Techstars Boston demo day on Tuesday, a showcase for startups.   201cStarting a business today is so different than in his time because you didn 2019t have to worry about online marketing, 201d said Adam Blake, who received his MBA from MIT 2019s Sloan School of Management.  201cWe thought bringing a 100-year-old dressed in a tie and jacket to a tech event would be a great way to emphasize that point of how different things are now. 201d  The T-shirt-, jeans-, and sneaker-wearing Techstars crowd could learn a thing or two about presentation dress. Or not. Times are definitely different than in 1935, when Prestley and his brother Curtis opened the first Friendly 2019s Ice Cream shop, in Springfield.   201cI especially wanted to have my grandson proud of his grandfather, 201d Prestley Blake said.  201cThe whole event was well done and very well received. Of course, I 2019m deaf so I couldn 2019t understand anything anyone was saying, but I saw the visuals. 201d  Techstars is a three-month accelerator program for startups that offers mentoring and up to $118,000 in seed funding and convertible notes. The summer session included 12 teams from the United States, Spain, Canada, Ukraine, and Portugal.  Since Prestley Blake lives in Connecticut and the event was in Boston, he needed a little bribing to make the drive, in the form of his son chauffeuring his parents.  But before Prestley Blake could share how he turned $547 into 650 stores, he got himself into trouble, again. He was stung by a swarm of bees on Tuesday morning in the woods. But, he took a Benadryl and was fine, Adam Blake said.  Good thing he was OK, as the 950 investors, entrepreneurs, and community members greeted Prestley, who stood on stage with only a cane, to a warm welcome.   201cI encourage them to pick someone who gives them extra credibility, somebody who is credible themselves, and makes people listen a little closer, 201d said Techstars Boston managing director Semyon Dukach. Prestley Blake 2019s  201cgreat tenacity is very inspirational. 201d  The Blake brothers sold Friendly 2019s in 1979 to Hershey Foods Corp. for $162 million. In 1988, Donald Smith and a group of investors bought the ice cream company from Hershey. Then in 2007, Prestley Blake became the company 2019s single largest shareholder in order to force then-chief executive Donald Smith out of the chain. Friendly 2019s was bought by the private equity firm Sun Capital Partners, and John Maguire is now the CEO.  Helen and Prestley Blake show no signs of stopping any time soon.

Considering Prestley Blake describes their home as a  201chot bed joint, 201d because the sheets are still hot when the next person comes to stay with them, the Blakes could give entrepreneurs a run for their money with the pace at which they live.

What Chinese authorities are doing is what the IMF has recommended for a long time, which is to allow markets to determine the exchange rate,  she said on Beijing's decision last month to devalue its currency.  One benefit is that loosening the (yuan's) link to the dollar gives Chinese authorities some independence to conduct their own monetary policy,  she told Reuters. Kochhar said there was a good chance the IMF would cut Japan's economic growth forecasts for 2015 and 2016 in its next World Economic Outlook report as China's slowdown and sluggish Asian demand weigh on exports.  So far the recovery in Japan this year has been frankly disappointing and bumpy,  she said, adding that wage gains have been particularly weak despite a tightening labor market.  NO 'CURRENCY WAR' Japan's economy contracted in April-June due to weak consumption and exports and analysts expect only a modest rebound in the current quarter, keeping the BOJ under pressure to further ease monetary policy. Some investors are betting the BOJ will ease at the end of October, when it is expected to lower its upbeat economic and price forecasts in a semi-annual review of its long-term projections. But Kochhar said the BOJ does not need to respond to temporary weakness in the economy and instead should focus on inflation expectations - which have risen moderately - in deciding whether to deploy additional stimulus.  The BOJ basically looks at inflation expectations and the output gap. Even if we were to lower our forecast, we see the output gap closing,  she said.  As long as there's not a very sharp decline in either, one could say (the BOJ is) on the right path.  Kochhar stressed that the BOJ's monetary efforts must be accompanied by government efforts to raise wages and deregulate the economy, in order for a sustained recovery. She shrugged off the view China's devaluation could unleash a rush among central banks to depreciate their currencies with monetary easing, including by the BOJ.  So far, the BOJ has responded appropriately (to market volatility). When there is market volatility ... the best response is to let the exchange rate move,  she said.  Exchange rate is not a target and has not been a target for the BOJ.

            "input": "text:After years of controversy, a pill to help women with low libido will finally become available in a few weeks. But there 2019s a catch: The prescription drug, Addyi, shouldn 2019t be taken with alcohol. And because the pill must be taken each day on an ongoing basis, this means no more drinking for those who take it  2014 ever.  There 2019s a sobering reason for this. But whether anyone will follow the instructions is another matter.  If nothing else, the uncertainty will probably extend the ruckus surrounding the medicine, which already inspired a contentious lobbying campaign that accused the FDA of being biased against treatments to help women overcome a loss of sexual desire.  Here 2019s the problem: A small study of 25 people found a few experienced a severe drop in blood pressure when mixing the drug and a few drinks in a short amount of time. All but two of those in the study, by the way, were men, which isn 2019t the best way to gauge an effect in women. The FDA is concerned women might have an even more pronounced reaction.  To get the word out, the agency has slapped a warning on the Addyi product label and insisted that the manufacturer, Sprout Pharmaceuticals, devise a so-called risk management program. Such programs are designed to restrict availability and lower the chance that a patient develops a serious side effect. Some might say fainting isn 2019t all that serious. Then again, you can crack your head open when you faint.  So the program requires doctors to become certified before prescribing the drug, which means they must review material about side effects and convey these to their patients. And only a select number of pharmacies will be allowed to stock the drug. Women, meanwhile, will have to sign a form stating they are aware of the risks before receiving a prescription, which might also be a way to limit legal liability.  But will women, who should expect only a very modest benefit from the drug, really refrain from drinking?  After all, women will have to take an Addyi every day because the drug works by manipulating the central nervous system. By comparison, erectile dysfunction drugs such as Viagra and Cialis work by increasing blood flow to the penis and so can be taken  201con demand. 201d Given that many people drink to lower their inhibitions, how practical is it to expect that some women will never drink while taking the drug?   201cWe see people all the time who we tell not to drink because they 2019re on certain medications. But the longer you 2019re on a med, the more likely you are to eventually think it 2019s OK to drink, 201d said Jen Gunter, an obstetrician and gynecologist in San Francisco.  201cWhen women first start taking a drug under such circumstances, they 2019re more careful. But later some start to wonder whether just one drink can hurt. 201d  Sprout 2019s chief executive, Cindy Whitehead, said she is confident that the risk program will work.  201cWe 2019re going to use it as an opportunity 201d to educate physicians and women about the possibilities for combating a loss of sexual desire, she said.  And she noted that Sprout, which sold itself to Valeant Pharmaceuticals for $1 billion two days after Addyi was approved, is committed to conducting three post-marketing studies in women that the FDA required to better gauge the effects of mixing Addyi with alcohol. The first must be done by end of 2016 and the others by the end of 2018.  As for the FDA, a spokeswoman reiterated the risk program is essential but acknowledged that avoiding alcohol will really be up to patients. Meanwhile, Addyi becomes widely available next month. And though Sprout has voluntarily agreed to refrain from running consumer ads for the next 18 months, recent media coverage of the drug has already generated tremendous buzz. In fact, even before the FDA approved the drug late last month, a recent survey found that 80 percent of 554 women would be willing to take Addyi. The survey, however, did not collect detailed information about the respondents.  Moreover, a spokeswoman for Treato, a social media research firm that conducted the survey, said women were not asked questions about their willingness to avoid alcohol or whether they had concerns about the risk of drinking while taking the drug.   201cThere 2019s really nothing they can do to prevent women from drinking, 201d said Ira Loss, a senior health care analyst at Washington Analysis, a consulting firm.  201cIf women are determined to take that medication and drink, they 2019re going to do it. Maybe the one thing that will serve as a reminder not to drink is taking the pill each day. But for some, a drink may still be tempting. 201d  Twice before, the FDA rejected Addyi because of such risks, as well as limited effectiveness. But at the time, the drug was owned by another company that was not part of the campaign accusing the FDA of bias. Michael McCaughan of Prevision Policy, a health care consulting firm, points to another factor.  201cAt this moment in history, 201d he said,  201cthe FDA is working to find a way to say yes 201d to drug approvals.  Perhaps the concerns about drinking will become moot. After all, if enough women find that Addyi isn 2019t particularly effective, the buzz will wear off and prescriptions won 2019t be refilled.  And alcohol sales might rise instead. Summary: A pill to help women with low libido will finally become available in a few weeks. But the drug, Addyi, shouldn 2019t be taken with alcohol.",

Lancashire County Council met Wednesday to vote on allowing U.K. exploration company Cuadrilla Resources, formerly chaired by ex-BP head John Browne, to frack at the Little Plumpton site, after planning officers earlier approved the site.  The run-up to the decision has been marked by protests by environmental groups. Cuadrilla has been blamed for causing two small earthquakes in the north England town of Blackpool in 2011  2013 which led to a moratorium on the controversial method of energy extraction.

In a decision that may cast a pall on management-led buyouts, Vice Chancellor Travis Laster said Dole Chief Executive David Murdock,92, and former Chief Operating Officer C. Michael Carter were liable for depressing the stock so that Murdock, who owned 40 percent of Dole, could buy the rest at a lowball price.  The judge said the $1.2 billion buyout undervalued Dole by 17 percent, letting Murdock pay $13.50 per share rather than the $16.24 that Dole was worth.  Deutsche Bank AG, which advised Murdock on the buyout, was cleared of liability because it did not knowingly participate in wrongdoing. Murdock is worth $3.4 billion, Forbes magazine said.  Thursday's award is among the largest in a class action lawsuit alleging that a company sold itself for too low a price, and highlights conflicts that managers wanting to buy their own companies may face in wanting to keep costs down.   It will make it harder to do management buyouts, and it should be,  said Charles Elson, a governance specialist at the University of Delaware.  The inherent conflicts are almost impossible to resolve. The ruling sends a signal that Delaware courts will be suspicious of these sorts of transactions.   More than half of U.S. publicly-traded companies are incorporated in Delaware, whose courts hear many valuation-based challenges to takeover bids.  Shareholders accused Murdock and Carter of driving down Dole's share price by downplaying the Westlake Village, California-based company's ability to boost profit by cutting costs and buying farms, and canceling a stock buyback.  In his 106-page decision, Laster saw Carter as the main engineer of the scheme, calling him Murdock's  right-hand man  and saying Carter  actually engaged  in fraud.   Although facially large, the award is conservative to what the evidence could support,  Laster wrote.  A nine-day trial was held in February. Several hedge funds had asked Laster to appraise Dole's value, but the judge said that issue may be moot.  Dole declined immediate comment on behalf of the itself, Murdock and Carter. Deutsche Bank spokeswoman Renee Calabro declined to comment.  Objecting shareholders had sought higher damages, but their lawyer Stuart Grant called the decision a  decisive  victory.   It wakes insiders and investment banks on their proper roles in a management-led buyout, and shows that management can't dictate the terms and the flow of information,  Grant said in an interview.  It shouldn't be a Wild West.   NOT A  CONFUSED OLD MAN   A high school dropout who made much of his fortune in real estate, Murdock was Dole's chief executive from 1985 to 2007, and again starting in 2013.  He had taken Dole private in 2003 and sold 60 percent in a 2009 initial public offering, in part to pay down debt as the U.S. economy struggled.  Murdock said he hoped through the latest buyout to combine Dole with his North Carolina research center, which seeks to unlock secrets of health and longevity.  But shareholders called the move a power play. Laster appeared to agree, calling Murdock  an old-school, my-way-or-the-highway controller, fixated on his authority and the power and privileges that came with it.   The judge said Murdock hurt himself during trial testimony, where defense counsel portrayed him as both a  confused old man  and a disengaged CEO.   By dint of his prodigious wealth and power, he has grown accustomed to deference and fallen into the habit of characterizing events however he wants,  Laster wrote.   That habit serves a witness poorly when he faces a skilled cross-examiner who has contrary documents and testimony,  he added.

            "input": "text:Renault's offices in France were raided. (AAP)  Shares in Renault have suffered a meltdown on the Paris stock exchange after anti-fraud detectives raided sites of the carmaker in an apparent emissions probe.  Union leaders, who first reported the raids, said the searches may be linked to suspicions of emissions foul play, raising fears that an ongoing Volkswagen pollution scandal was spreading to neighbouring France.  But Renault, while confirming there had been searches, said that no cheating devices had been found in diesel engine tests which had earlier been commissioned by Environment Minister Segolene Royal.   The news triggered a massive selling movement, it's a disaster that's pulling everybody down,  said one Paris-based analyst, referring to plunging auto stocks across Europe.  At around 2AM AEST, Renault shares were trading nine percent lower at 78.86 euros, having earlier slumped as low as 67 euros, a drop of over 20 percent -- at that point wiping over 4 billion euros ($4.4 billion) off the company's value  which is colossal , the analyst said.  On Thursday unions reported that French anti-fraud detectives had last week raided several production sites of Renault, possibly to search for any indication of software meant to help cars cheat when undergoing tests for pollution emissions, as Volkswagen has admitting 11 million diesel vehicles.   Agents from the (anti-fraud unit) DGCCRF intervened in various Renault sites last Thursday,  the CGT Renault union said in a tract.  The probe targeted the sites' engine control units which suggests, the union said, that the raids  are linked to the consequences of the Volkswagen rigged-engines affair .  Detectives took several personal computers belonging to Renault managers, the unions said.  But Renault played down the raids, saying they were part of a probe by the DGCCRF aimed  to confirm definitively the initial analysis conducted  at the behest of Royal and which had  not shown evidence of illegal cheating software on Renault vehicles.   At the time of the stock exchange debacle, the Royal commission was presenting its conclusions after tests on 100 car models to the minister, and a news conference was scheduled later Thursday.  French rival Peugeot, France's biggest car maker whose shares also plunged, quickly released a statement saying it had not been the target of any anti-fraud raids, adding that similar government tests had resulted in the  absence of any anomaly  in car emissions.  Peugeot shares subsequently came off their lows, trading 3.3 percent down at 14.26 euros, off an earlier 13.33 low.  The Renault news weighed on auto stocks across Europe, with BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen all falling more than five percent at one point.  Volkswagen is facing possible fines that could reach into the tens of billions of dollars in the United States alone over the scandal, and faces probes in other countries as well.  Fiat Chrysler stock, meanwhile, crashed after a report saying the company has been accused of conspiring to inflate its US sales figures. The company said the claims were unfounded.

There is a form of pessimism, such as in China where people work really hard because they are scared that they will be old while they are still poor.   Pessimism in China motivates hard work. Pessimism in Europe has a more demotivating effect. When you're pessimistic and unmotivated, it has as self-fulfilling character.   Mr Thiel has a reputation for forthright views. In Zero to One, a new book, he writes that tech start-ups should aspire to become monopolies because the rapidly shifting nature of the sector ensures they  don't typically last for ever  and that  disruption , a Silicon Valley obsession, is a  self-congratulatory buzzword .  Private equity-backed IPOs hit 7-year highStrong demand for Rocket Internet's IPOTech chiefs in plea over privacy damage  Mr Thiel, a libertarian, also attacked EU regulators and policy makers, which have sought to rein in the likes of Google, Uber and Facebook, where he is a board member, with regulatory probes related to antitrust and privacy.   Google obviously has a monopoly in search,  he said.  There are all sorts of questions about whether it is abusing that monopoly or not. But I distrust the power of the EU regulators to make things better. I think the [technology industry] is dynamic enough that the Google monopoly will not last for ever. In practice, anything [the EU does] to micromanage the Google product will produce a cure that's worse than the disease.   He does have encouraging words to say about London, which he said straddles continental Europe and the US in attitude and has overtaken Berlin as the best and  most logical place  to build technology businesses.  People just work harder here ,  he said.  They just work less hard in Berlin.   Mr Thiel, who has rarely invested outside of the US, has invested in two start-ups based in the UK capital: TransferWise, a money transfer business, and Deepmind, an artificial intelligence group bought by Google for  00a3400 million last year.  The city's strength is in start-ups that combine financial services and technology.  London is a financial hub, and unlike New York, it's not a financial hub where people hate finance,  he said.   There's much more of a self-hating character to New York than there is to London. This matters, because if you start a tech company in New York, you will do something very far from finance. Whereas in London, it would be perfectly respectable to do something with finance and technology.   But he is critical of Rocket Internet, the German ecommerce venture capitalist, which announced the pricing for an initial public offering, targeting a midpoint market capitalisation of  20ac6.2bn, last week. The  20ac1.5bn IPO was fully subscribed within hours of orders being taken, leading the group to bring forward the flotation.   I would not invest in Rocket . . . I would not take a venture capital firm public, because so much of the value comes from the people who have started the companies, and its hard to separate the human capital from the operational component,  he said.  He added that Rocket's companies, which often involve imitating successful business models from the US and exporting them to new markets, are  much more plays on globalisation than on technology . . . and I believe technology is more important than globalisation .

            "input": "text:CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 17 - Laura Shortill had a 3.6 grade point average at her Buxton, Me., high school and her SAT's were  fairly average,  she said.  Nothing astronomical.   So when she applied to Harvard, Ms. Shortill knew it was a stretch. And she had a backup: Harvard.  Although Ms. Shortill was accepted elsewhere, including Johns Hopkins, when she was rejected by Harvard College, she moved to Cambridge anyway. She enrolled in a bachelor's degree program at Harvard University Extension School -- for a fraction of the admissions requirements and a fraction of the cost.   I had Harvard as my reach school,  said Ms. Shortill,20,  and I had Harvard as my safety school.   Students Ms. Shortill's age make up a small but growing percentage of Harvard Extension School these days, said Michael Shinagel, the dean. While the school does not keep count, he said, the number of bachelor's degrees it gives out (118 last year) is double that of 10 years ago, largely because of younger students, at least some of them drawn by the chance to experience Harvard at bargain-basement prices.   I can tell by the physiognomy, by the color of the hair, by the body types that we're getting leaner and younger,  Dr. Shinagel said.  Clearly the trend is to a younger student population.   Extension and continuing-education schools have long served midcareer adults and people with some previous college credit. They still account for most extension students, and many do not accept students under 25 or without college experience.  But schools that accept younger students say interest is increasing, driven largely by economic considerations, although at Harvard it is also fueled by the fact that it is Harvard.   There is a group of what you might call traditional college-age students who are with us now,  said Robert E. Wiltenburg, dean of University College, the extension school of Washington University in St. Louis.  Dean Wiltenburg said that the number of students in his undergraduate degree program tripled in the last five years, and that most students studying full-time were 25 or younger.  University of Phoenix, a continuing-education school with 176 campuses, last year dropped its rule that students be at least 22, and now 18-to-22-year-olds are nearly 10 percent of its 160,000 undergraduates.  At University of Maryland University College, a continuing-education school, students 25 and under seeking bachelor's degrees are the fastest-growing population, tripling to 4,200 in 2004 from 1,400 in 1997, said Mary Ellen Hrutka, dean of undergraduate studies.   Faculty members are adjusting their pedagogy to reflect age diversity,  Dean Hrutka said, including in her course on women in business, where all the students once had careers, but now several are too young.  The trend reflects the increasing number of students struggling to afford college, even as they realize it is increasingly necessary, experts say.   The cost of college has risen, and the federal aid that is available has not kept up,  said Kay J. Kohl, executive director of the University Continuing Education Association.  A large proportion of traditional-age college students come from low-income families or are basically debt averse.   The same impulse has more students attending community colleges for two years before switching to a four-year institution. The National Center for Education Statistics reported that in 2000 only 27 percent of students fit the traditional description of enrolling right after high school, attending full-time, being financially supported by parents and either not working or working part-time.  Extension schools, with evening and weekend classes, appeal especially to students who need jobs to afford college and whose income then disqualifies them for financial aid but is not enough for full tuition.  Harvard Extension School, with its mission of making a part of Harvard broadly accessible, is unusually inexpensive, charging about $550 per lecture course compared to about $4,000 per course at Harvard College.  Other recent high school graduates, as well as home-schooled students, are also pursuing bachelors degrees at Harvard extension. Jeanne Margaret Nurse, although largely an A student, did not even apply to Harvard's undergraduate program. One of 12 children, Ms. Nurse,20, who went to high school in St. Louis, said her family's income was too high to qualify for financial aid but too low to afford a regular college.  And Chip Perro is thrilled with his extension school decision.   I really wanted to go to a good school,  said Mr. Perro,21, from the Boston suburb of Natick, who failed to get into Harvard College or other top universities.  My degree will be a degree from Harvard University. Sounds pretty good to me.  Summary: Growing number of younger students are attending extension and continuing-education programs that have long served midcareer adults and those with some previous college credit; schools that accept younger students in such programs say interest is increasing, driven largely economic considerations; at Harvard University Extension School, interests is also fueled by fact that it is Harvard; experts say trend reflects increasing number of students struggling to afford college, even as they realize it is increasingly necessary; extension schools, with evening and weekend classes, appeal especially to students who need jobs to afford college and whose income then disqualifies them for financial aid but is not enough for full tuition; Harvard Extension School, with mission of making part of Harvard broadly accessible, is unusually inexpensive: $500 per lecture course compared to $4,000 per course at Harvard College; professors say some courses are virtually identical to those at Harvard College; say differences come mainly from students; some professors say real-world experiences of extension students make classes less academic and more practical; photos (M)",

            "input": "text:It has to be hard pitching a new-media business when your name is Sean Parker. While helping to build Facebook in the early days is definitely a feather in your cap, many people also know you as a co-founder of Napster, and that doesn 2019t generate what you might call warm feelings. But there 2019s more than that behind the movie industry 2019s reluctance to embrace Parker 2019s Screening Room.  For one thing, Screening Room is about as far away from copyright-infringing downloads as you could possibly get. The new venture from Parker and co-founder Prem Akkaraju is designed to give movie studios an additional way to reach potential viewers in the early days of a movie 2019s release, while it 2019s still in theaters.  The Screening Room pitch is fairly straightforward. Consumers buy a $150 box that sits near their television set, and by using it they can buy first-run movies on the same day they appear in theaters, for $50 apiece. Through encryption and other digital protection mechanisms, users are given 48 hours to watch the movie, and copying or sharing of the content is (theoretically) impossible.  Parker and his partner have reportedly signed up some pretty high-profile supporters, including Hollywood names like Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, J.J. Abrams and Ron Howard. In a statement they released recently, Howard and his partner Brian Grazer said:  When we met Sean and Prem last year it was clear Screening Room was the only solution that supports all stakeholders in the industry: exhibitors, studios and filmmakers. The SR model is fair, balanced and provides significant value for the entire industry that we love. We make movies for the big screen and for as many people to see it. Screening Room uniquely provides that solution.  One of the largest movie chains in the country, AMC Theatres, has also reportedly signed on in support of the Screening Room model. But plenty of others in the industry don 2019t like it at all.  The National Association of Theatre Owners, for example, says it emphatically isn 2019t in favor of Screening Room 2019s model. Although it doesn 2019t go into great detail about why, the organization said in a statement that solutions to the ongoing issues caused by the digital release of films should be developed  201cby distributors and exhibitors in company-to-company discussions, not by a third party. 201d  Cinemark, one of the nation 2019s largest theater owners, told Entertainment Weekly that it is skeptical about Parker 2019s plan, because the traditional theater exhibition window  201chas been the most stable window long-term, and the theatrical success of a film drives the value proposition for the studios 2019 downstream ancillary markets. 201d  Sign up for Data Sheet, Fortune 2019s technology newsletter.  The chance that movies released through Screening Room 2019s proprietary box might be pirated is probably among the fears that theater owners have, but the real concern is much bigger than that. In a nutshell, theater chains are afraid that the lure of the movie theater is waning already, and that offering families the ability to watch first-run films in their own homes will eat even further into the grip that the country 2019s movie chains have on the  201crelease window. 201d  It 2019s not just theater chains who don 2019t like Screening Room. Despite the support of Scorsese and Spielberg, other Hollywood directors aren 2019t crazy about the proposal, including Titanic director James Cameron and Inception director Christopher Nolan. Bill Mechanic, a filmmaker and former executive with 20th Century Fox, told Deadline:  Anything that tries to eliminate the theatrical window or shorten it where it doesn 2019t matter is completely short-sighted. And if you are in a business that no longer has theatrical, it becomes the land of the giants 2014then it is a question of only what can break through the clutter. It 2019s very myopic to think that it 2019s not ultimately destructive.  In essence, the control over what movies get seen and when 2014and the magical experience of seeing a film on the  201cbig screen 201d 2014is about all the theater industry has going for it any more when it comes to competing with digital content from Netflix and others. So any attempt to shrink the release window brings chains out with guns blazing, including attempts by new content companies to release their films online at the same time as they appear in theaters.  Why Netflix is dumping The Hunger Games  In a statement about Screening Room, the Art House Convergence 2014which represents about 600 cinema owners 2014said the company 2019s model is  201cincongruous with the movie exhibition sector by devaluing the in-theater experience. 201d The group went on to say that the project would result in  201ca decline in overall film profitability through the cannibalization of theatrical revenue. The theatrical experience is unique and beneficial to maximizing profit for films. Cinema grosses must be protected. 201d  Parker and his partner have tried to mollify movie distributors and chains by promising a revenue share, with exhibitors getting a piece of the $50 per movie fee. It 2019s also offering users two tickets to see the same movie they just bought through Screening Room in an actual theater. But groups like the AHC aren 2019t convinced this is going to make up for the disruption they face. As the group said:  The proposed model suggests exhibitors will receive $20 for each film purchased. At first glance, an exhibitor may think it represents a small, but potentially steady, additional revenue stream. But how will this actually be divided among the number of theaters playing the purchased title; will exhibitors who open the title receive more than an exhibitor who does not get the title until several weeks later?  In their attempt to cozy up to the movie industry, meanwhile, Parker and Akkaraju may have also managed to structure their service so that few consumers will be interested in it. Are there that many movie lovers who want to buy a separate set-top box just so they can pay $50 for a first-run movie the same day it appears in theaters? Even if you assume multiple people are going to watch, $50 per movie isn 2019t exactly cheap. But even at that price, it still seems to be too much of a threat for theater chains to embrace. Summary: The Napster co-founder's Screening Room proposal isn 2019t what the industry needs, say theater owners.",

But much of its subject matter is likely to resonate.  The original was a hit, spurring its move from off-Broadway to Broadway in 1989 (even though TIME 2019s first take on the show found that it was  201clike an unconscious cartoon of feminist dialectic 201d full of  201cmostly whiny and self-congratulatory cliches 201d).

Instead, with subtlety and humor in The Heidi Chronicles, she has written a memorable elegy for her own lost generation. Heidi tells the story of a slightly introverted art historian, a fellow traveler in the women 2019s movement, who clings to her values long after her more committed friends switch allegiance from communes to consuming. At the pivotal moment in the play 2019s second act, Heidi (played by Joan Allen) stands behind a lectern on a bare stage, giving a luncheon speech to the alumnae of the prep school she once attended. Slowly the successful veneer of Heidi 2019s life is stripped away as she tries to ad-lib a free-form answer to the assigned topic,  201dWomen, Where Are We Going? 201d Heidi 2019s soliloquy ends with these words:  201dI don 2019t blame any of us.

So much of what the world now knows and recognizes as photojournalism, after all, was originally shaped by Cartier-Bresson 2019s work in the 1930s, and especially by the methodology he developed and pursued with his peers Robert Capa and David Seymour, or  201cChim 201d: incessant travel, always with camera in hand; the search not for mere adventure, but for meaning in both conflict and in utterly quotidian calm; and finally, the hunt for specific, never-to-be repeated scenes, instances, gestures that would, in less than a heartbeat, tell a tale that no moving image or written word could possibly surpass.  Like William Blake 2019s admonition to  201csee a world in a grain of sand, 201d Cartier-Bresson 2019s defining aim has been summed up in the notion of (in the English translation)  201cthe decisive moment 201d  2014 that is, the fraction of a second when a living tableau presents itself to a photographer, and he or she must rely on both instinct and experience to know when to make the picture, to get the shot.  That Cartier-Bresson routinely cut up  2014 literally cut up, into pieces, with scissors  2014 his contact sheets and discarded those pictures that did not come close to capturing a decisive moment hardly lessens or cheapens the scope of the man 2019s singular and still, today, almost overwhelming achievement. But the practice of ruthlessly culling weak images from the strong does, perhaps, provide insights into the admirably unsentimental nature of an artist like HCB  2014 and perhaps nowhere was this lack of undue sentiment more striking than in Cartier-Bresson 2019s color photography.  There 2019s a reason, it turns out, why coming across his color photos can be so jarring; not only did Cartier-Bresson infrequently shoot in color, but he destroyed virtually all of his color negatives, leaving the almost exclusively black-and-white legacy familiar to most photography fans. Finding out that Cartier-Bresson shot professionally in color  2014 and sometimes worked on major, long-term assignments in that format  2014 is the sort of unexpected revelation than provides the student of photography with not only a surprise, but a sudden sense of enlargement.  One of Cartier-Bresson 2019s most significant color projects was a 1958 assignment for LIFE: a four-month,7,000 mile tour through communist China during that country 2019s convulsive  201cgreat leap forward, 201d when the huge, ancient nation was being alternately pushed and pulled, dragged and harried by its leaders to leave its past behind and to embrace industrialization, collectivism and the precepts of Chairman Mao. ( 201cThe staggering Chinese upheaval  2026 goes on, 201d LIFE wrote of the  2018great leap, 2019  201cspurred by the biting fury that Mao himself expressed when he declared, Communism is not love, Communism is a hammer we use to destroy the enemy. 201d)   201cWith the perceptiveness for which he is famous, 201d LIFE declared of the photographer 2019s work in China,  201cCartier-Bresson has shown how the Chinese individually react and live amid the oppressive regimentation imposed on them. 201d  Whether or not viewers today see what LIFE told its readers they would encounter in that issue in early 1959, what remains clear in the pictures presented here, in both color and in black and white, is that decades into his long, varied career Cartier-Bresson was still seeking and still finding those never-to-be-repeated decisive moments.

Kawakubo and her husband and business partner, Adrian Joffe, delineated their guerrilla idea with a no-nonsense precision usually reserved for actual combat operations. The shops, which are installed in raw urban spaces -- the Berlin outpost occupies a former bookstore; the Helsinki a 1950's pharmacy -- sell  seasonless  merchandise drawn from current and past collections, must remain unsullied by architects and designers and are required to close after a single year.  While the venture might be interpreted as a call to arms against the aggressive commercialism and gaudy architecture of high-concept flagship behemoths like the Rem Koolhaas-designed Prada stores, it has also engendered a delicious absurdity: in their rejection of concept-store pretension, the guerrilla stores have realized its purest expression. A news release issued by Comme des Gar 00e7ons lays out the  rules  behind this anti-concept with the earnestness of F.T. Marinetti's futurist manifesto:  The location will be chosen according to its atmosphere, historical connection, geographical situation away from established commercial areas or some other interesting feature,  reads one rule.  The idea may be easy to send up, but guerrilla retailing is also smart business, allowing companies to tap into new markets at low cost (rents are cheap; advertising is nil) and to reduce inventory by recycling old merchandise. Indeed, others have joined Comme des Gar 00e7ons in employing this marketing tactic. Alife, a Manhattan collective best described as a gallery, store and hipster brain trust, partnered with Levi's this fall to create a line of jeans that sold for one month only, and Vacant, a high-end retailer that bills itself on its Web site as the  original traveling guerrilla retail concept and exhibition,  has opened ephemeral store-gallery hybrids in empty spaces across the globe. A spokeswoman for Comme des Gar 00e7ons notes that the guerrilla project has been wildly successful ( Warsaw met 300 percent of its projected monthly sales in the first week ). The company now plans to open shops in Los Angeles, Brooklyn, S-o Paulo and Istanbul.

            "input": "text:SAN FRANCISCO - DANIELLE STEEL'S books have sold 550 million copies. Tom Perkins, Ms. Steel's former husband, has sold just a handful of his first romance novel,  Sex and the Single Zillionaire,  but he's not giving up.  Mr. Perkins is, of course, a lion of the venture capital world, having been a co-founder of Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers and helping to create companies like Genentech and Tandem Computers.  Perhaps some in Silicon Valley who believe business plans qualify as gripping prose might wonder why Mr. Perkins would have the energy or desire to write a steamy romance. But it's not as unexpected as it might seem.  Mr. Perkins, a relentless achiever at 74, says he cannot slow down. He's currently building what he calls  the biggest sailing yacht in the world,  a hobby he has pursued on a grand scale. He's an insomniac who friends say seems to have boundless energy.  And he cannot resist a challenge.  Mr. Perkins got the idea for the novel in 2003 when he was invited to try out for a reality show (he declined the invitation) about young beauties vying to marry a rich older man.  When it first struck him to base a romance novel around the TV show, he proposed the idea to Ms. Steel, who was married to him for a year before they divorced in 1999 (they remain friends). But she cajoled him into writing it himself.   If you don't do it, it's because you're lazy, ' Mr. Perkins said she told him, and thus a writer was born.  The novel, published in February by ReganBooks, an imprint of HarperCollins, is the story of a wealthy New York financier, grief-stricken over the death of his wife. He is invited to join a reality show and falls for the program's producer.  Some of his book is autobiographical. Mr. Perkins, like his protagonist, was a widower, having lost his wife of 35 years to cancer before he married Ms. Steel. Like his hero, Mr. Perkins has two children and is immensely wealthy. His protagonist finds serenity in love, but Mr. Perkins continues to strive.   I am not satisfied easily,  he said in a recent interview in his office overlooking San Francisco Bay. In fact, when asked to define his idea of success, Mr. Perkins said,  Stress successfully overcome is triumph.   Some business partners may now see Mr. Perkins, the new novelist, in a slightly different light. Frank Caufield, Mr. Perkins's longtime partner, recently read  Sex and the Single Zillionaire.    I thought it moved along at a good pace,  Mr. Caufield said.  I thought the characters were fine, as romance novels go.   Mr. Perkins, gracious and charismatic, cuts a fit figure. He used to play tennis, but quit because losing made him too angry, he said. He is the son of an insurance adjuster, and was the first in his family to go to college, attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he studied electrical engineering.  In 1978, he, Mr. Caufield and two other partners founded their venture capital firm, which helped define venture investing in technology companies. The firm's investments have included Yahoo, Google and America Online.  Mr. Perkins puts his net worth in the  mega millions  but somewhere less than a billion, though still enough to finance his hobbies. It has been enough to build his latest sailing yacht, which is 88 meters long, and such boats typically cost a million dollars a meter.   At one time, I had the finest automobile collection in the world,  Mr. Perkins said.  I sold it before the bottom fell out of the market in 1987.  Afterward, he turned to boating --  I had the best classic yacht in the world  -- which he used to compete and win major races in Europe, then sold.  When he wrote the 288-page  Sex and the Single Zillionaire  in early 2004 at his country home in England, he said he worked hard to cultivate his inner artist and listen to his  unconscious self.  He wrote the book in only 100 hours over 30 days.  He received some advice from Ms. Steel and his literary agent. They sent the book to various publishers, eventually getting a small advance from ReganBooks. Mr. Perkins had earlier sent a copy to Rupert Murdoch, whose company owns HarperCollins, but Mr. Perkins said he didn't believe that influenced the decision to publish.  Mr. Murdoch did give an endorsement, though, on the book's back cover.  Fun, fast -- a great read!  Mr. Murdoch wrote.  Mr. Perkins said he had no illusions of having written the great American novel. He calls the book  souffl 00e9,  not  meat and potatoes.  Ms. Steel, he said, is urging him to write another one, but he wants to finish his yacht first. Still, he says he has started thinking about another book idea. This time, it will be about life in San Francisco and Silicon Valley.  As for his motivation, perhaps he wants to create a legacy beyond wealth, a desire that seems common among successful venture capitalists, says Paul S. Kedrosky, the executive director of the William J. von Liebig Center for Entrepreneurism and Technology Advancement at the University of California, San Diego.   They're all looking for influence beyond being a glorified banker,  Mr. Kedrosky said.

            "input": "text:TriBeCa Film Festival is in full swing. And while watching films debut back to back is incredible, one aspect more noteworthy is the festival's emergence of up-and-coming actors. Over the course of 11 days, everyone will be scoping out talent that will soon be breaking it big in the industry. And one of our top picks this year is Savannah Kennick.  The young actress first got her start as a model at the age of fourteen. Quickly, she was being booked for campaigns in Italian Vogue, Teen Vogue, and Seventeen Magazine. Her modeling career brought her to New York City, where Kennick was inspired by the creative atmosphere around her and decided to switch gears and become an actress. It's a bold choice that has since paid off. Kennick will be making her first ever film debut during TriBeCa's  Holidays  premiere. The film is anthology feature film that puts a uniquely dark spin on some of the most iconic holidays. The piece follows a young high school outcast who receives praise from her diving coach and sets out to get him the perfect Valentine's Day gift ever, no matter what the costs. Kennick plays Heidi, your not-so-typical high school mean girl, characterized by her twisted traits.  While this may only be Kennick's first time on the big screen, her performance in this physically and emotionally demanding role makes her a festival stand-out.  So before Savannah Kennick becomes a household name, you can get to know the young actress on a more personal level. We recently had the chance to sit down with Kennick at our NYC offices during TriBeCa Film Festival to talk about her experience on set, her incredible pieces of advice for young actresses like herself, and her grueling first day on the job.  You were a model first. Why did you decide to make the switch into acting? I was fourteen and I had been scouted in New York. And I was living in such a creative environment in New York and I was meeting so many artists that I expressed that to my agent I wanted to go into acting. I went to LA and then decided to move a year later, and I've been here ever since.  What was that move like for you? Oh it was insane! I was born in such a small town so going to LA where people don't talk to you and want to know how your day is going was completely foreign.  Was acting something that was already on your radar growing up? I loved watching movies and television, and again, because I grew up in a small town that's how I saw the world. And then I realized that it was something that I could do,  I thought, why not?   Did you grow up with a love for horror films? I grew up loving horror films! It was my thing. I spent most of the time watching behind my hands and peeking out once in a while. I grew up with  The Exorcist  and  Poltergeist  and  Silence of the Lambs  was a favorite .So  Holidays  wasn't a foreign territory for me. I understood how to amp emotions up to intensify the fear for viewers.  What was life like on set for you? Well, since we are independent and didn't have a budget, I didn't have a trailer which was interesting. But life on set was amazing and very quickly we became a family and I felt like I could do anything and I would have been accepted. Like I could have said,  Alright guys I need to use the bathroom so I'm going to go here on the floor,  and they would have said,  Okay, great!   What was the most memorable moment you had while filming? The very first take I did on my set was the climax of my character. I had to be beaten in the face with a brick and fall into a pile of mud. I think it was 40 degrees outside that day so I was just lying in freezing cold mud for six hours take after take.  What was the internal process like developing your character? I worked a lot with the directors. I think we worked for four days for twelve hours at a time to figure out why it is she is so filled with angst and hatred. And I don't necessarily agree with her, but I understand her motives. That was amazing to do that, because that's the key to being an actress is having your character down pat.  What did a typical day on set look like for you? Up at 5 am, on set by 6 am, and stealing all the coffee I could off of craft services and a lot of dying repeatedly. It was awesome. I'm like a cat that has nine lives.  What has your first TriBeCa festival been like for you? It's crazy! I was getting on the plane to come here and I was with our producer, and somebody asked us where we were going and we said TriBeCa and the guy freaked out and said it was so amazing. Who would have known that an independent film with no trailer would be doing this?  That's kind of the beauty of TriBeCa isn't it? Any type of film can get representation. Which is amazing for independent films especially since they're so good but they don't get enough exposure.  Is there any actor or director you would love to work with in the future? I totally don't have a list in my bedroom up on my wall.... David Fincher is my absolute favorite. I mean  Gone Girl  and  Fight Club  were so good! I love Cate Blanchett and Meryl Streep of course. But so many though! I could go on forever and you would just say,  Savannah please just shut up.   What's the direction you would like to go with next in your movies? I love drama. It's really fun. But with drama, you have to have a lot of internal focus, which is hard for me because I'm crazy. It's really nice to have to work hard on something, so I'd love to do more film and independent films because that's where the creativity really lives.  One piece of advice you wish you had received before filming? I take a screenwriting class because I love all aspects of filmmaking. One day I was having a lot of problems since after I wrapped this film, I was going to a lot of auditions and wasn't getting a lot of feedback. And my screenwriting teacher told me,  Savannah you don't have to get the darts on the bulls eye, it just has to be on the board.  And I wish someone had told me that because I'm such a perfectionist and spend hours trying to get everything right. I wish someone had told me that everything doesn't have to be absolutely perfect, but it just has to make you feel good.  For more on this year's TriBeCa Film Festival, watch the video below!

He then bound the victim 2019s hands with metal zip ties, taped his ankles together and covered his face with a pillow.  He also tied up another worker returning from a bank drop and took his money, police sources said.  A customer found the employees and called 911. No one was seriously injured.  A thief snatched money from an elderly woman 2019s hand as she left a Union Square bank, police sources said.  Harold McNamara,45, allegedly held the door open for the 73-year-old victim as she walked inside the Apple bank on Irving Place near 14th Street last Wednesday night.  After she withdrew $200 from an ATM, McNamara swiped the money and ran off. Officers caught McNamara Saturday when he was picked up for an unrelated burglary.  They showed him surveillance video of the bank incident and he freely admitted,  201cThat 2019s me, that 2019s me. I did it. 201d  He said he used the money for a crack fix, police sources said.  McNamara was charged with robbery and grand larceny.  A man with an arrest record for drugs was shot dead in a barrage of gunfire in Throggs Neck, law-enforcement sources said.  Marc Spruell,28, was at the Throggs Neck Houses on Dewey Street near Swinton Avenue when he was struck 10 times in the chest and leg at 12:38 a.m. Sunday, police source said.  Police were called and rushed the victim to Jacobi Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.  A Jewish man was charged with a hate crime after he pummeled an Arab man and keyed his wife 2019s car in Mill Basin, authorities said.

Responding police hauled the hate-spewing suspect to jail.  A crook wielding a butcher knife stole $1,300 from an East New York Burger King, police sources said.  The thief pulled out the knife when he confronted a female worker on Linden Boulevard near New Jersey Avenue at 8:33 a.m. Sunday.  Once inside, he threatened a manager and demanded money from a safe. The manager turned over the cash from the safe, and the perp fled.  Now Mets fans are taking their anger out on police.  A foul-mouthed baseball fan attacked a police officer at Citi Field, authorities said yesterday.  Joseph Casale,19, allegedly caused a ruckus in the Jackie Robinson Rotunda on June 19.

I 2019m not going to calm down, 201d according to a spokeswoman for Queens District Attorney Richard A. Brown.  The irate teen allegedly knocked the cop down and punched him. Other officers rushed to the aid of the injured cop and slapped cuffs on Casale.  He was charged with resisting arrest, obstructing governmental administration and disorderly conduct.  Police busted two thugs after they brutally beat and robbed a man in Stapleton, police said.  Anthony Suazo,20, and Benjamin Bermudez,21, jumped the victim on Beach Street near Van Duzer Street at 4:08 a.m. Saturday, said a spokesman for Staten Island DA Daniel Donovan.  The duo allegedly pummeled the victim, knocking him to the ground. They then rifled through his pockets and fled with his wallet.  Cops spotted the robbers nearby with fresh blood on their sneakers and hands and arrested the suspects on charges of robbery and assault.  This guy kicked off his Fourth of July party too early.  Jason Rodriguez,26, was nabbed Sunday night for illegally setting off fireworks in front of his Great Kills home on Demopolis Avenue, according to a spokesman for the Staten Island DA.

            "input": "text:Norfolk Southern nsc once again said  2018no thanks 2019 to rival Canadian Pacific cp .  On Wednesday morning, the railroad company officially rejected a takeover offer from its rival, calling the latest offer  201cgrossly inadequate. 201d Norfolk maintained that the big issue was that there was a high likelihood that regulators would reject a combination of the two railroads, and that the regulatory risk was too great to accept an offer. Norfolk said its analysis was based on consultations with two former commissioners of the Surface Transportation Board (STB), which would have to approve the combination.  On Dec. 16, Canadian Pacific upped its $30 billion cash-and-stock bid for Norfolk by offering to issue a  201ccontingent value right 201d (CVR) to Norfolk shareholders. The CVR is supposed to compensate Norfolk shareholders if Canadian Pacific 2019s shares fall during the process of combining the two companies. Norfolk said the CVR would trade at a significant discount, and that it didn 2019t really represent a better offer for its shareholders. Norfolk rejected Canadian Pacific 2019s first offer last month.  A number of large deals have been stopped by regulators this year. On Monday, the Federal Trade Commission said it would block Staples bid to buy OfficeDepot. Canadian Pacific has said that it believes a deal with Norfolk would be ultimately approved. But Norfolk says that Canadian Pacific should request pre-approval for the deal from the STB, which the board has the right to give. Last month, Daniel Elliott, chairman of the STB, said that the review process for a Canadian Pacific-Norfolk deal would be lengthy and could take as long as 18 months.  Last week, a number of members of Congress, including U.S. Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, wrote a letter to the STB saying that the board should carefully consider the potential negative impact of the deal on Chicago 2019s rail network.  201cWe urge you to carefully review any plans submitted to the STB, and consider the potential negative impact of the proposal with respect to building a more efficient freight network in Chicago 2026 and comprehensively examine the economic effects of such a consolidation on local industries and jobs in the Chicago region, 201d the statement said.  Norfolk 2019s stock has a market cap of $26 billion, and shares were up slightly on the rejection of the offer, perhaps suggesting that shareholders think Canadian Pacific could once again up its offer. Norfolk 2019s latest move leaves Canadian Pacific 2019s CEO Harrison Hunter with the option of abandoning the deal, or going to directly to Norfolk 2019s shareholders, possibly with a higher offer. Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman is the largest shareholder in Canadian Pacific. Ackman supports a deal with Norfolk, and has said that Norfolk 2019s CEO Jim Squires lacks the ability to turn around the railroad. Summary: $30 billion cash-and-stock bid called  grossly inadequate.

Each year, more than 3 million patients in the U.S. are admitted to hospitals for emergency general surgeries -- a group that includes the highest risk and most acutely ill patients.  Prior to the study, lead researcher Dr. Joaquim M. Havens, director of Emergency Surgical Services at Brigham & Women's Hospital in Boston, said he noticed that patients who were coming in with serious medical problems requiring unplanned emergency surgery were not faring as well as he thought they should.   When you look at surgeries done emergently and surgeries done electively, the outcomes are so different,  he told CBS News.  It really challenged me to look deeper into what was going on.   Havens and a team of researchers analyzed a government database of more than 420,000 patients who underwent emergency general surgery between 2008 and 2011. Heart-related procedures and surgery resulting from traumatic events like car crashes were not included in the analysis.  The researchers ranked procedures by total burden, taking into account frequency, complications, mortality rates, and financial costs. In the end, they found seven operations that collectively accounted for 80 percent of procedures, 80 percent of deaths, 79 percent of complications, and 80 percent of inpatient costs nationwide.

            "input": "text:You could probably create a fair amount of energy from the heated arguments that rage between those still pushing fossil fuels, proponents of various 'sustainable' alternative (wind, tidal, solar) plus those who support building more nuclear power stations  2013 the fission sort that split heavy elements like uranium and plutonium, creating long-lived radioactive waste along the way.  All these arguments would vanish if we could just do the 'other' nuclear, whose dazzling potential was summed up by Stephen Hawking:  201cNuclear fusion...would provide an inexhaustible supply of energy, without pollution or global warming. 201d Where do I sign up?  Nuclear fusion is truly cosmic, powering our sun and other stars. It transforms hydrogen into helium by fusing atoms together in an atomic rearrangement that converts a little mass into a lot of energy  2013 just think of Einstein's famous E=mc2 equation. Fusion keeps reactions going for billions of years in stars, while sending heat and light out to grateful Earthlings.  The Sun does it stellar fusion using massive gravity to ram atomic nuclei together at temperatures around 15 million degrees C and pressures 100 billion times those at the Earth's surface. And that's a combination we just can't mimic on our third rock out.  However, hydrogen also exists here in two varied forms (isotopes) - deuterium and tritium - that can be made to fuse into helium at just a couple of times normal atmospheric pressure. Furthermore, deuterium is easily obtained from ordinary water, while thousands of years supply of tritium can be extracted from varied sources, including seaweed.  But while fusing just one gram of deuterium-tritium fuel yields an energy equivalent to burning 10 tonnes of coal, it is a reaction requiring temperatures even hotter than the Sun  2013 around 100 million degrees C. Matter this hot turns into a state known as  201cplasma 201d, containing ions and neutral atoms, along with liberated electrons that allow current and electricity to flow. A naturally occurring plasma on Earth is forked lightning.  One way to generate plasma-forming temperatures is firing high-powered lasers at a tiny pellet of fusion 'fuel'. Another uses microwaves to deliver an instantaneous heating punch equivalent to a couple of thousand kitchen microwave ovens. The bigger issue is containing and controlling a 100 million degree plasma to stop it touching and burning through its surrounding reactor container.  Scientific heresy or pure potential?  Since the 1980s, some mavericks have preached an idea many mainstream scientists treat like heresy  2013 cold fusion. This claims fusion reactions can be created without the need for high temperatures or massive kit at all, via a phenomenon dubbed LENR (low energy nuclear reactions).  Today's leading LENR proponent is Italy's Andrea Rossi, who claims to have operated his  201cE-Cat 201d cold fusion reactor since 2011, using a fuel of nickel powder and hydrogen. He has now partnered with a US energy company for what he claims is a trial of a 1 mega-watt reactor for a secret US customer. Other researchers say they have reverse-engineered the reaction Rossi claims to use, and managed to generate more heat via a mysterious reaction than could be explained by any known chemical process.  If may sound like a case from 'The X-Files,' but Rossi has received a US patent for his E-Cat technology. The Japanese government has also begun funding LENR research, while a scientific conference on LENR took place in 2015.  Maybe cold fusion really is cool!  The answer to date has been magnetic fields which use the charge in plasma to control it. Prototype fusion reactors are therefore ringed by massive super-cooled and super-conducting magnets wrapped around the reactor core where the plasma appears. Various arrangements of magnets are being tried to gain the best level of control, bearing names like tokomak, spherical torus or stellarator.  One pioneering fusion prototype was the Joint European Torus (JET), a UK-based tokomak reactor still operating at the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy near Oxford. Switched on in 1983, it has kept a hydrogen plasma stabled for several seconds at a time - enough to trigger fusion, but not long enough to create a sustained reaction to get past the magic  201cbreak-even 201d point where the reactor starts giving out more energy than has to go in to get the plasma.  In France, meanwhile, a huge reactor called ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) has been taking shape in a giant hanger in Provence since 2010  2013 though preparatory work began in 1998. If this 15-storey high behemoth  2013 using brainpower from 35 nations  2013 does it thing properly, an even bigger follow-up reactor is planned called DEMO which experts hope might plug into the global grid in the 2030s.  One issue with ITER is that its 1990s conception has given it a reliance on some technology that has since been superseded. Specifically, its giant magnets are cooled by expensive liquid helium, greatly bumping up its cost.  Recent research by America's Plasma Science and Fusion Centre at MIT, however, has produced plans for a reactor using magnetic coils made from barium copper oxide, which can be cooled using much cheaper liquid nitrogen. The MIT device has been christened with a degree of American chutzpah, the ARC - 'affordable, robust, compact'  2013 and could provide the basis for a commercial reactor within a decade.  The pace is quickening too at Germany's Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics on the Baltic coast..  German engineers changed the world today, 201d said Alden Truesdale proudly, after her team successfully created a plasma using helium  2013 easier than a hydrogen one  2013 in December 2015. The Germans had further cause to celebrate after creating a hydrogen plasma in February this year.  The German's Wendelstein 7-X - a stellarator reactor  2013 took 19 years and $1.1 billion to build, so the ongoing drive for nuclear fusion isn't cheap. But if the journey so far has been long and dogged with dark clouds, maybe, just maybe, a little Sun-on-Earth is about to shine.

            "input": "text:outros Boutros Boutros Boutros Ghali  is how Ali G addresses the dignified former secretary general of the United Nations. Posing as an interviewer for an MTV-esque channel catering to hip, undereducated British youths, Ali G persuades the elderly statesman to say  merde  and even spell it for him in French.  Ali G is the stage name of Sacha Baron Cohen, a British comedian who is famous in England as his comic persona, a white gangsta rapper wannabe (also known as a wanksta) who speaks a strangled argot of cockney, Jamaican and hip-hop slang. That is not his only character. He also plays Borat, an eager, na 00efve journalist from Kazakhstan whose wide-eyed reports from the United States are framed with Cyrillic graphics and traditional Central Asian music. Sometimes he is Bruno, the effete Austrian host of a hyper-hip television show about fashion, who in one segment crashes the runway of a designer collection by saying he is  Chrysler's muse.    Da Ali G Show,  which begins tonight on HBO, is irresistibly, corrosively funny. It also serves as a reminder of why HBO is home to so many comedies and dramas that are unmatched on network television. It is not just that Ali G uses obscenities that cannot be repeated in a family newspaper or on most networks. A little like the humor on  The Office,  a wickedly funny pseudo-documentary on BBC America about office workers in a London suburb called Slough, Ali G is clever, satirical and entirely free of any redeeming sentimentality; in mean spirit he is closer to Monty Python or Larry David's  Curb Your Enthusiasm  than to most popular comedies, including  Saturday Night Live.   Ali G's refusal to wink or blink when interviewing starchy American officials is exquisitely painful to watch.  Wot iz legal?  Ali G asks Richard Thornburgh, the former attorney general, while dressed in a yellow Tommy Hilfiger skullcap, oversized yellow track suit, sunglasses and gold  bling bling  jewelry. Mr. Thornburgh courteously shares a few rudimentary insights into the American system of justice. He looks only slightly puzzled when Ali G asks him if he saw  Barely Legal 3,  which he describes as a movie about college girls getting spanked when they don't complete their homework.  Among others, Ali G interviews United Nations officials; Mr. Thornburgh and a predecessor, Edwin Meese 3rd; Newt Gingrich; and Brent Scowcroft, the former national security adviser. He tries out for a Philadelphia police training academy and, as Borat, seeks an American wife to take home to Kazakhstan. He tells the dating service consultant that he can provide his bride with  a television, with remote  but that she must have  plow experience.  The consultant, like others, is perplexed but patient.  The only person who bridles on camera at Ali G's willful stupidity is a Roman Catholic priest participating in a round table with a rabbi, an atheist and a professor. Flaunting a defiant ignorance reminiscent of the droogs in  A Clockwork Orange,  Ali G confuses Jesus Christ with Santa Claus and asks the panel if God is not  just an overhyped version of David Blaine,  the magician.  No,  the priest replies.  And a lot of people would find that remark very offensive.  Ali G blithely says,  Sorry,  and continues in the same vein. The priest, remarkably, does not storm out  2014 a testament to the ungodly power of television.  The best British humor is callous, a trait that helped prompt American colonists to revolt in 1776. Despite all the shared shows and cross-pollination of the two cultures, there is still a different sensibility about comedy. Like Ali G,  The Jamie Kennedy Experiment  on WB relies on its star's ability to channel outlandish characters and dupe bystanders. But at the end of each imposture his true identity is revealed, and everybody hugs in laughter and relief. On Ali G, there are no happy endings.   The Office,  on BBC America, is a huge hit in Britain and has a smaller cult following here. It is funny precisely because it is coldly immune to the kind of good-natured banter, laugh tracks and underlying benevolence of American workplace sitcoms like  Less Than Perfect.  Its deadpan mock documentary style is instead reminiscent of the movie  This Is Spinal Tap.   Ricky Gervais, who writes the series with its director, Stephen Merchant, brilliantly plays the office boss, David Brent, as a self-deluded loser  2014 a blend of Captain Queeg and the Copy Guy played by Rob Schneider on  Saturday Night Live  in the early 1990's. A Hollywood television studio is working on an American adaptation, but it is hard to imagine anyone there, except perhaps Larry David, who would have the steel to be true to the show's misanthropic core.   Absolutely Fabulous,  another British import, was closer to a conventional sitcom, but its two heroines never wavered in their selfish, dotty hedonism. The show's writers displayed an almost Churchillian determination to never give in to sentimentality. Similar American shows are rarely as tough-minded. The sitcom  Cybill,  in its heyday, could never quite keep a sour upper lip, though Christine Baranski did her best as the martini-swilling divorc 00e9e and best friend. Even  Will and Grace  occasionally drops the No 00ebl Coward insouciance and gets misty.  It is probably unfair to mention a new comedy show,  The Michael Essany Show,  which begins on March 2 on the E! channel, in the same universe as two British comedies as strong as  Ali G  and  The Office.   But  The Michael Essany Show,  which is a reality show wrapped around a college sophomore who runs a late-night cable-access show out of his parents' living room, illustrates the point. The precocious Mr. Essany, who aspires to be the next Johnny Carson or Jay Leno and speaks in a nasal whine similar to the voice of Ross on  Friends,  could be a very amusing satirical character if his show were a parody along the lines of  The Larry Sanders Show.  Sadly, Mr. Essany plays himself, his parents play his parents, and there is no comic invention, clever writing or satire of misplaced teenage ambitions. The result is occasionally affecting, but mostly it is boring.  In comedy, sincerity is no substitute for wit.  HBO, tonight at 12:30 a.m., Eastern and Pacific time; 11:30 p.m., Central time.

            "input": "text:The FBI 2019s recommendation against criminal charges in the Hillary Clinton email matter drew immediate comparisons to last year 2019s high-profile case in which the agency took the opposite position and pursued the prosecution of then-CIA Director David Petraeus.  The Petraeus case, long seen by some as a potentially analogous investigation into the mishandling of government secrets, resurfaced within minutes of the FBI 2019s announcement on Tuesday when Republican presidential Donald Trump tweeted:  201cThe system is rigged. General Petraeus got in trouble for far less. 201d  But that statement is dubious. Though both investigations examined the handling of classified information by powerful government officials, and both drew the attention of the highest-ranking officials of the FBI and the Justice Department, the probes are separated by critical distinctions.  In Clinton 2019s case, for instance, FBI Director James Comey said that though the former secretary of her state and her aides had been  201cextremely careless 201d with classified information that flowed through her private email server, there was no evidence that anyone intended to violate laws that govern the handling of secret records.  Yet when Petraeus pleaded guilty last year to sharing binders of classified information with his biographer, a woman with whom he was having a sexual relationship, the Justice Department made clear that the retired Army general knew the material was top secret when he divulged it and had lied to the FBI about it.  Petraeus told Paula Broadwell, his biographer, in a recorded conversation in 2011 that the black books he was giving her were  201chighly classified 201d and contained  201ccode word stuff, 201d prosecutors said. A year later, he told FBI agents who questioned him that he had never shared classified information with Broadwell.  Though he was never charged with making false statements, Petraeus admitted to a misdemeanor crime of mishandling classified information and received probation and no prison time.  That misdemeanor outcome, in a case prosecutors said involved evidence of a false statement and willful mishandling, struck some legal experts and law enforcement officials as overly generous and likely made it much harder to bring any charges in the Clinton investigation  2014 a case Comey said was lacking in criminal intent.   201cThe evidence in the Petraeus case of willfulness was significant, 201d said James Melendres, a former Justice Department prosecutor and the lead prosecutor in that case.  201cThe false statement was an aggravating feature. 201d  Those are among the elements of a crime that the FBI looks for in investigations concerning the mishandling of classified information, Comey said Tuesday. Cases prosecuted for that offense historically involve intentional or willful mishandling of classified information, signs of disloyalty to the United States, efforts to obstruct justice or the disclosure of vast quantities of secret records.   201cWe do not see those things here, 201d he said.  The Petraeus case is  201cmore in line with the types of cases that have been prosecuted, which is when information was clearly marked or there is a significant amount of it in paper, 201d said Mark Zaid, a Washington national security lawyer.  Even so, Comey, in an extraordinary 15-minute public statement at FBI headquarters, left no doubt that the FBI had detected significant problems in her email practices as secretary of state.  The FBI chief said that in the course of the investigation, 113 emails were determined to contain classified information at the time they were sent or received. He also said that  201cseveral thousand work-related emails 201d were not among the group of 30,000 that Clinton turned over in 2014.  He said there was evidence of  201cpotential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information. 201d But, he said, there was no evidence that anyone intended to violate any laws and that the FBI 2019s judgment was  201cno reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case. 201d  Criminal charges could theoretically have been brought but would  201cdefinitely have created a new precedent 201d given the large number of government officials who are similarly lax in their treatment of sensitive records, Zaid said.   201cWhile it could have been prosecuted, I think as a practical reality, the precedent it would have created would have had far-reaching ramifications throughout the entire system, 201d he said.

Cameron Sterling sobbed into his shirt before turning into the arms of a family member.   I want my dad,  he could be heard saying as his mother, Quinyetta McMillon, excoriated the officers who shot his father, Alton Sterling.   The individuals involved in his murder took away a man with children who depend upon their daddy on a daily basis,  Quinyetta McMillon said.  My son is not the youngest, he is the oldest of his siblings. He is 15 years old. He had to watch this as this was put all over the outlets.    As some may know, Alton sold CDs, and was doing just that, not bothering anyone. And had the consent of the store owners as well,  McMillon said.  Officers Blane Salamoni and Howie Lake II have been placed on paid administrative leave as the shooting is being investigated by federal authorities. Salamoni has been with the Baton Rouge Police Department for four years, and Lake has been on the force for three years, according to police.  Sterling died early Tuesday outside a convenience store where he was selling CDs. Authorities say he was confronted by police after an anonymous caller said he saw a man threaten someone with a gun. In a cellphone video taken by a community activist, two officers appeared to have Sterling pinned to the ground. Gunfire erupted moments after someone yelled,  He's got a gun! Gun!   Sterling was pronounced dead at the scene.   00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

            "input": "text:A diverse Republican band of Donald Trump haters, conservatives and other rebels have set their sights on derailing the billionaire's march to their party's presidential nomination.  They're seeking new supporters, spending money on TV ads, hiring staff and even setting up office space near the Cleveland arena where the party gathers later this month for its national convention.  Despite their ongoing effort, Trump is moving steadily toward nailing down the nomination. Here's why it will be hard for the dissidents to prevail:  While many top Republicans have criticized Trump and announced they won't go to Cleveland, the party hierarchy has largely been lining up behind his drive for the nomination, despite his divisive statements and unruliness as a candidate.  Their argument: Whatever Trump's faults, how do you take the nomination away from the guy who won 13.4 million votes in GOP primaries and caucuses, far more than his opponents? And besides, who's the alternative candidate?  Along with staff from Trump's still small campaign, members of the Republican National Committee, state GOP leaders and others have formed a team of around 150  whips  who are contacting convention delegates and cajoling them, though perhaps not always gently.  On the 112-member convention rules committee, a likely battleground for efforts to free the delegates, around a third are from the 168-member GOP national committee and most will loyally back Trump in rules fights.  There are exceptions. Also on that rules committee is Colorado delegate Kendal Unruh, a leader of the fight to let delegates to vote their  conscience,  and North Dakota RNC member Curly Haugland, who has long insisted that even under current rules, delegates are free to back anyone.  Many RNC members say the rebels will lose overwhelmingly in committee votes.  ... are stacked against the insurgents. Trump triumphed in the vast majority of this year's primaries and caucuses, giving him 1,542 delegates, according to The Associated Press. That's well above the 1,237 needed to clinch the nomination.  Now, it's true those delegates can vote however they wish during convention battles to change the rules, so delegates pledged to a candidate could back anyone they want. And you can count on such defections, because some delegates representing Trump actually prefer Texas Sen. Ted Cruz or others.  But Trump still has a big numerical advantage.  According to an informal count by one party insider, Trump can rely on a solid 900 delegates, compared to a combined 650 for Trump opponents plus delegates backing Cruz or other candidates.  That leaves over 900 remaining delegates. Trump would need only about a third of them to prevail. And don't forget, many delegates are party regulars inclined to want a gathering that's peaceful, not a GOP civil war on prime time TV.  The anti-Trump forces have said they have more than 400 delegate supporters.  Unruh says she has enough votes on the rules committee to allow the full convention to vote on her proposal to let delegates vote their  conscience  and abandon the candidates they are supposed to support. She needs just 28 votes for that to happen. Her opponents say she'd lose in full convention anyway, but are countering with their own amendments.  An RNC member from Oregon, Solomon Yue, is proposing that any rules changes take effect only after this month's convention, to  take the politics out of  the rules debate.  Arizona RNC member Bruce Ash is offering language aimed at ensuring that delegates remain bound to their candidates.  Another tactic party officials are discussing: using their muscle to prevent any rules changes, period. They argue the current rules already mean delegates must stay with their candidates.  They may be outnumbered, but the dump Trumpers have cards they could try playing to be disruptive.  Under current rules, a sympathetic delegate can slow down roll calls by demanding that their state delegation chairman recount the tally. They could force roll calls on minor matters that would usually pass quickly by voice vote, and lodge other time-consuming procedural challenges.  There's a limit to that strategy.  The convention's presiding officer, which at times will be House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the convention chairman, doesn't always have to recognize delegates seeking recognition. And if the dissenters try the same tactic repeatedly, he or she can rule their moves dilatory and move on.  Another dissidents' hope - what if Trump's poll numbers get really, really bad?   What is the Republican Party's tipping point?  asked Steve Lonegan, a leader of Courageous Conservatives, which is backing the rebellion by raising money for ads and other expenses.  Is it down 10 points, 12 points, 20 points?   In a conference call among dump Trump supporters Tuesday evening, conservative writer David French congratulated participants for trying to defeat  an evil man.  And conservative commentator William Kristol told the group,  Win or lose, I think this is an important moment  toward establishing  the principle that the delegates have the right to vote as they see fit.

He likes to call himself a  cheap hawk  who would be able to handle the duel tasks of ensuring U.S. security and preventing a bloated Pentagon budget.  Perhaps the most famous example of Kasich's defense frugality on display was his crusade to discontinue the B-2 stealth bombers that cost taxpayers billions of dollars.  He opposes the nuclear deal with Iran, telling New Hampshire voters,  Sometimes you have to say no to a bad deal, period, end of story, exclamation point, that's it.  He elaborated on his opposition in a radio interview with Hugh Hewitt a few weeks later, saying that Iran should be required to change its behavior before the U.S. agrees to negotiate with them. He also calls for a more automatic imposition of sanctions if Iran is caught cheating rather than subjecting it to a debate.  On the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Kasich has taken one of the more hawkish positions by calling for U.S. ground troops to fight the group.   It's either you're going to pay more now or a heck of a lot later,  he told voters in New Hampshire earlier this summer.  This is something that has to be dealt with. Let's just do it. We can rally the support of the public for this.   That's not the only arena where he argues for more military action. He has been critical of the Obama administration for refusing to supply the Ukrainians with weapons to defend themselves against a Russian incursion and said that the U.S. should send an aircraft group to the South China Sea to  send...a little message  to the Chinese about building artificial islands in disputed waters.  Kasich said on CNN's  State of the Union  in August that he  would have never committed ourselves  to the war in Iraq - an issue he never had to vote on since he left Congress after the 2000 election. It's also not what he said about the Iraq war in 2002.   We should go to war with Iraq. It's not likely that [Saddam] Hussein will give up his weapons. If he did he would be disgraced in the Arab world,  Kasich said during a 2002 speech at The Ohio State University.  Kasich also said in the CNN interview that the U.S. should have left a base behind in 2011 when President Obama withdrew troops, and that he would have supported rebels in Syria working to overthrow Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.  Kasich will speak more extensively about his foreign policy vision on the campaign trail in South Carolina Monday.

They want you to convict Dr. Murray for the actions of Michael Jackson,  Chernoff told the court.  Chernoff also said Murray's  greatest personality defect is his greatest character strength,  adding,  Dr. Murray  had no control over the situation because of what was happening in the background. He was just a little fish in a big, dirty pond.   He suggested the only reason the case even went to trial was because MJ was a celebrity.  If it were anybody else but Michael Jackson, would this doctor be here today?  Chernoff asked.  * Murray made mistakes. But this is not a civil case. For a crime to be committed, the prosecution has to show Murray killed MJ.  * Chernoff tried to discredit Alberto Alvarez testimony. He said it didn't make sense that Murray would ask him hide evidence because they barely knew each other.  * Alvarez testified he grabbed the IV bag with both his hands ... but none of his fingerprints were found on the bag.  * Alvarez also said he noticed a milky substance in the IV bag, but no traces of Propofol were found inside the bag.  * There are no photos showing a vial inside an IV bag. The coroner investigator testified she took the vial out of the bag BEFORE taking a picture.  * LAPD detective Scott Smith also testified he never saw a vial in a bag.  * Murray didn't need to create an elaborate IV set up -- placing a vial inside an empty bag -- when he could have used the hanging tab on the Propofol bottle.  * The tubing found in MJ's bedroom did not have any Propofol in it.  * Good scientists don't take positions. Dr. Shafer had an agenda.  * Chernoff told jurors,  Dr. White knows more about Propofol than Dr. Shafer will ever know.  He said White had no reason to lie.  * Murray didn't call 911 because he was busy trying to save MJ's life. He immediately started CPR ... when that didn't work he called for help.  It's easy in hindsight to say he's a lousy doctor,  Chernoff said.  It's easy to make those statements when you've never had a patient and a friend like Michael Jackson. You can judge Dr. Murray for what he did but don't question his motives.   * Chernoff told the jury,  There is a tremendous desire to paint Murray as a villain. There is no perfect villain or perfect victim.  He said the prosecution tried to make Murray look guilty when they showed surveillance footage of him leaving the ER ... a witness for the defense testified Murray was on his way to another part of the hospital to help the family draft a press release.  * Chernoff asked jurors not to hold Murray responsible just because it's Michael Jackson, saying,  it's not a reality show...

He continued:  Based upon your statements, and despite the fact that we have always done so well together, especially in your ratings, I am canceling my May 18th appearance on your show.   Additionally,  Trump wrote,  please inform your staff that I will likewise not do the 'top ten' list that they had been trying to set up.   On his show Thursday night, Letterman discussed with guest  Dr. Phil  McGraw Trump's persistent questioning of whether Obama is an American citizen and demeaning his qualifications for getting into Harvard Law School.   It's all fun, it's all a circus, it's all a rodeo until it starts to smack of racism. And then it's no longer fun,  said Letterman.  Letterman also said that if Trump comes on his show again,  he ought to be prepared to apologize.  Trump's smackdown of Letterman follows tongue-lashings he gave Jerry Seinfeld and Robert De Niro after they similarly objected to his questioning of Obama's birth certificate.

Even 70 years later, we must continue to fill out the Holocaust narrative.  For example, for too long, the story of the Holocaust has been from the perspective of the perpetrators. We owe it to the victims to present their narrative, too. That 2019s what we 2019ll be doing at the Amud Aish Memorial Museum: telling the stories of the people who lived  2014 and too often died  2014 during the Holocaust, with special emphasis on the faith-based community whose story has largely been untold.

Holocaust survivors are leaving us. This fact, combined with the rise in anti-Semitism around the world, reminds us that we must work even harder as second, third and fourth generations to ensure that the lessons of the Holocaust continue to guide us.

She was deported to Auschwitz, where she was stripped, shaved, tattooed, starved and made to do slave labor. Later shipped to Bergen-Belsen, she contracted scabies and then died of typhus. Her sister and mother died before her.  The horrors of the Nazi Holocaust are limitless, but any narrative of this darkest chapter in human history should begin and end with the fact that a million and a half children were murdered by the Germans and their collaborators. And their deaths often involved all the baroque cruelty the Nazis were infamous for.  So, in this age of simmering racial and ethnic tensions, it is a good thing that Amsterdam may finally be getting a Holocaust museum. I hope that it has a special section devoted to children like Anne.  A version of this letter appears in print on July 28,2016, on page A26 of the New York edition with the headline: May the Lessons of the Holocaust Still Guide Us.

If the rumors are right, Apple will unveil a new iPhone next month that will differ little from the one in my shirt pocket. An improved camera and the elimination of the old-school headphone jack are about all we can look forward to.  Still, iPhone loyalists will have at least a little incentive to line up outside the Apple store. Not so the millions who use Apple 2019s venerable line of Mac personal computers. Shop for one of these, and your choices are mostly the same as they were a year or more ago.  Certainly the popular Retina MacBook Pro is showing its age, having gone without an update for well over a year. But it 2019s much worse for other models. Apple 2019s low-cost Mac Mini hasn 2019t been updated since 2014. Then there 2019s the Mac Pro, Apple 2019s top-of-the-line machine for movie editors and graphic artists. The Mac Pro was state-of-the-art when it was released over 2 00bd years ago, and it had a price tag to match: $4,000. Yet today, Apple 2019s still selling the same machine, at the same price.  That would be commercial suicide in the Windows PC world. Raza Haider, executive director of commercial computing at Dell Inc., said his company upgrades pretty much every model every year.  201cWe always want to make sure that our users are getting the latest and greatest performance, 201d Haider told me.  Dell has no choice. If it rested on its laurels the way Apple has done, a horde of rival Windows PC makers would happily take up the slack. After all, Windows machines are utterly interchangeable. Don 2019t like the features on the latest Dell? Buy an HP or a Lenovo instead. Your software won 2019t care which brand of computer it runs on, so get the hottest one you can afford.  Faced with fierce competition from Android smartphones, the company obliges its fans with annual iPhone updates. But Mac users are far less likely to defect. They love the unique operating system and dread the expense and trouble of converting to a Windows machine, even one with a newer, faster processor.  And after all, the speed boost would hardly matter. Intel, which makes about 95 percent of the world 2019s PC processors, keeps producing better and better chips. But lately the improvements have been marginal. Moore 2019s Law, the principle that computers would double in processing power every couple of years, is finally petering out.   201cIf you look at what Intel has today versus three or four years ago, it 2019s maybe 10 percent better, 20 percent better, 201d said chip analyst Linley Gwennap of the Linley Group in Mountain View, Calif.  201cComputers have become like cars. You don 2019t buy a new car every year or two, 201d Gwennap said. Indeed,  201cthe cars are actually getting better faster than the PCs. 201d  It 2019s bad news for Intel, whose chief executive, Brian Krzanich, warned in June that most users now go for five or six years before thinking about a new PC. That 2019s why Intel is laying off 12,000 employees, 11 percent of its global workforce.  Clearly, Apple is onto something. Why invest millions in annual Mac updates, when few customers will benefit? For that matter, why offer price cuts on aging Macs, when customers keep buying? For quarter after quarter, Mac sales continued upward, bucking the yearslong slump in Windows PC sales.  But not lately. Mac sales have now declined for three quarters in a row, probably because many potential buyers are sick of being offered leftovers.  Michael Oh, founder of TSP, a Boston company that creates Mac-based computer systems for businesses, said that Apple needs to make some moves with the Mac, and fast.  201cIf we get into the fall and Apple hasn 2019t done what amounts to a complete refresh, 201d Oh said,  201cI don 2019t know what the message is. 201d  Actually, the message is coming through loud and clear. On Wednesday, Bloomberg Technology reported that Apple will soon roll out a new batch of MacBook Pro laptops.  They 2019ll feature a slightly faster processor, a bit more storage, and other marginal improvements, like a keyboard that replaces the traditional row of function keys with a long, thin touchscreen.  Still, all these enhancements add up to nothing much.  Expect the same from the next iPhone, from new Android smartphones and Windows computers, and for all kinds of tablet computers. There 2019s been a great leveling off of innovation in digital hardware, and apart from a busted touchscreen or a crashed hard drive, it 2019s hard to see much point in buying the latest gadget.  So you might as well stick with same old, same old.  After all, that 2019s what you 2019ll get  2014 even if you get something new. Summary: Innovation is slowing dramatically, not only at the iPhone and Mac maker but across the consumer tech world.",

            "input": "text:Santana  201cCoraz 00f3n 201d (RCA Records) 2 Stars  If you believe press releases, Carlos Santana never recorded a Latin album before  201cCoraz 00f3n, 201d the disc that comes out Tuesday.  That 2019s sorta correct and sorta not.  True, the legendary guitarist of Mexican descent has never before issued a record entirely cut with singers and musicians marketed as Latin pop or rock stars. And his latest release does just that. It marries Santana 2019s stinging leads to vocals from artists like Colombian rocker Juanes, bachata heartthrob Romeo Santos and smoky Mexican chanteuse Lila Downs.  But Santana's work, from the late 1960s to today, has always drawn on Latin genres  2014 from salsa to cumbia to the vast range of folk styles from his father 2019s land. He also stands as the virtual inventor of what became known as  201crock en espa 00f1ol, 201d the catch-all that morphed into the broader sales term Latin alternative music.  The tag offers an appropriately loose definition for what you 2019ll hear on  201cCoraz 00f3n. 201d It 2019s a grab bag of genre hybrids, from the reggae Latin-rock collaboration with Ziggy Marley in  201cIron Lion Zion 201d to the Argentinian ska-rock mix with Los Fabulosos Cadillacs in  201cMal Bicho. 201d  One tete-a-tete directly undermines the album 2019s claim of being a first. It 2019s an update of Santana 2019s 1970 hit cover of Tito Puente 2019s salsa classic  201cOye Como Va, 201d tarted up with Miami hip-hop filigrees by Pitbull. The Juanes-fronted cut ( 201cLa Flaca 201d) more covertly references the past. It mirrors the slink of Santana 2019s old hit  201cSmooth. 201d  Half the songs have English lyrics, but that 2019s only the project 2019s most obvious compromise. Like most star collaborations, this one shoehorns in some ill-suited, name-brand guests  2014 like Gloria Estefan and R&B 2019s Miguel. Santana 2019s glistening leads compete with, rather than complement, these artists. Some tracks feel as awkward as Match.com first dates.  A few tracks do click. The best moments include the melding of Downs and Spanish flamenco singer Ni 00f1a Pastori. Or the jazz foray with Santana 2019s old pal Wayne Shorter.  But even the best cuts tip off a lost opportunity. Latin alternative music features so many artists who would have paired better with Santana 2019s style  2014 from Colombia 2019s Aterciopelados to Monterrey, Mexico 2019s, Kinky to the act that has most paralleled his pioneering work, Brazil 2019s Os Mutantes. Wrangling artists like those would have made this album a true first.  Damon Albarn  201cEveryday Robots 201d (XL Records) 4 Stars  He 2019s one of the most famous stars in modern Brit-rock. But how much do we really know about Damon Albarn?  Over the last 20 years, Albarn has led international hit bands from Blur to Gorillaz. He has also composed film soundtracks, written an opera and forged several collaborations with musicians from Africa.  Yet  201cEveryday Robots 201d marks the first time Albarn has released an album under his own name. The dizzying range of his previous output seemed specifically geared to defy any set definition of him as a person or an artist. In case you missed the point, Albarn 2019s best-selling act  2014 Gorillaz  2014 was a virtual band, visualized as cartoon characters rather than humans.  It 2019s no surprise, then, that Albarn chose to center his first solo work on notions of alienation. Key lyrics explore our modern-day reliance on machines.  201cEvery day robots in control, 201d he murmurs in the title track.  201cWe 2019re in the process of being sold. 201d  That 2019s hardly an original observation, but Albarn individualizes it with the convincing dislocation of his music. It 2019s a slow, dense, wholly internalized work, floating around Albarn 2019s wan and pasty vocals.  His voice is one of the few clear sounds. It 2019s surrounded by numb, compressed or highly manipulated sound, creating music at once airy and tactile.  The percussion in  201cThe Selfish Giant 201d hisses and snaps. In  201cHollow Ponds, 201d it smacks and scrapes. The vaporous approach still manages to establish momentum.  To add to the disembodiment, spoken-word samples bleed into the mix. Three prominent ones come from an intellectual comic of the 1950s, Richard Buckley, aka Lord Buckley. His persona works well for this project, considering how he hid his true self. He was an American impersonating a Brit.  Albarn also makes generous use of his global influences, mixing in Asian tunings, African chorales, even some Caribbean music  2014 all to unconventional effect.  The relationship between the music and Albarn 2019s voice deepens the album 2019s theme. It circles him from a distance, leaving him at the mix 2019s lonely core. Together, that makes  201cEverybody Robots 201d a kind of musical answer to Spike Jonze 2019s film  201cShe, 201d minus the romance. It 2019s a fully realized portrait of a man in the age of technology, reaching out for his real self and coming up with air.

            "input": "text:A decade ago Marc Benioff declared that software was dead. In 1999, while on leave from his job at Oracle orcl , he convened a group of developers in his downtown San Francisco apartment building to build Salesforce.com. Soon thereafter he paid the quirky rockers the B-52 2019s $250,000 to perform at a bash where he distributed buttons with the word  201csoftware 201d crossed out, Ghostbusters-style. And that was all before he had signed up a single customer.  Benioff 2019s audacious goal: to take down enterprise software 2019s stalwarts (including Benioff 2019s employer) with a new business that let companies rent the software they use instead of buying it.  It was outrageous! It was brazen! And it worked. Salesforce crm , now a public company with a market capitalization of about $3.5 billion, generates revenue of more than $1 billion a year 2014a 60% five-year annual growth rate 2014all from providing software subscriptions to businesses.  201cWe 2019ve always believed everything 2019s going into the cloud, 201d Benioff says triumphantly.  For more on Salesforce, watch this Fortune video:  See Salesforce on 2016 Change the World list HERE.  Benioff,44, is the original evangelist of what 2019s now known in tech circles as  201ccloud computing. 201d That 2019s shorthand for centralized computing services that are delivered over the Internet (a.k.a. the  201ccloud 201d). He sold companies  2014 from small businesses to Merrill Lynch  2014 on the notion that they should stop investing in expensive servers, elaborate software systems, and regular maintenance fees to handle their customer-management databases. Instead he persuaded them to pay Salesforce a monthly fee and log on to their software programs over the web. No more PC updates. No more computer crashes when the traffic spikes. Salesforce would manage it all.  The biggest purveyors of software, companies such as Oracle, SAP, and Microsoft msft , initially scoffed at Benioff 2019s idea. Centralized computing was fine for small businesses and consumers. (Web-based e-mail such as Google 2019s Gmail is a good example of simple cloud computing.)  Oracle launched a service on Sales.com. Tag line?  201cNo force necessary. 201d  But it seemed unlikely that security-conscious Fortune 500 companies would store their software and critical customer data on central computers that they didn 2019t own and control. (Some are still scoffing. Oracle CEO Larry Ellison has called the current fascination with cloud computing  201ccomplete gibberish, 201d though he helped fund Salesforce and hasn 2019t sold his stake in the company.)  Benioff 2019s relentless marketing and promotion 2014some would say self-promotion 2014of software as a subscription service hasn 2019t always helped his cause; some competitors rolled their eyes and dismissed him as a showman rather than a serious business executive.  But as broadband networks proliferated and Salesforce rolled out ever tighter security systems (more on that in a moment), customers started signing up. It also helped that more corporations, including brokerages and banks, grew comfortable 2014even preferred 2014using offsite data centers to back up precious data.  Now, as the economic downturn forces businesses to cut back on their tech spending, a growing number of companies are turning to Salesforce, rival NetSuite (N) (another company that Oracle 2019s Ellison financed), and others as a cheaper alternative to purchasing software. Research firm IDC expects overall spending on subscription software to grow at a compounded 18% a year, to $19.8 billion, by 2012. As the biggest standalone software-as-a-service company in the industry, Salesforce is sure to benefit from the uptick in demand.  Read More: The Salesforce Do-Good Legacy  The typical Salesforce customer is a company like the Minneapolis-based Haagen-Dazs Shoppe, which is owned by Nestle USA. Brand manager Julie Michelutti figures that she would have had to spend $65,000 for a custom-designed database to help her stay in contact with the company 2019s retail franchises. Instead she spent an initial $20,000 to establish service with Salesforce, and she now pays $125 per month for 20 users to remotely monitor, via the web or their PDAs, all the Haagen-Dazs franchises across the country.  Software companies are taking notice. Despite Ellison 2019s comments, Oracle at the end of January launched a new version of its online sales-management product, which seems to be a direct swipe at Benioff. The product, inelegantly called CRM On Demand Release 16, can be found at the website sales.com, and a tag line reads:  201cNo force necessary. 201d It has an estimated 5,000 customers to Salesforce 2019s 51,800 customers, but prices are competitive and it particularly appeals to companies that have long used Oracle 2019s products.  In February, SAP said it would be releasing a software-as-a-service product in May. And Microsoft also has customer-management software available. IBM ibm just named a cloud-computing czar, and Google goog and Amazon amzn are launching ambitious initiatives that will bring down the cost of computing by using the Internet to deliver applications that companies formerly purchased. (For more on the competitive landscape,  201cThe Client-Server Model: Not Dead Yet. 201d)  To keep the lead in the market that his company created, Benioff has entered some new areas. The company last year launched Force.com, where developers can build their own software to integrate with Salesforce software. Now if a company uses Salesforce to manage its customer databases, it can build an application to manage, say, its human resources as well. Salesforce says its largest customer runs 13 software programs on Force.com, in addition to the original customer management service.  201cThere are few places to go once you 2019re hooked into the Salesforce community, 201d says Forrester Research analyst Liz Herbert.  201cIt wouldn 2019t be easy to switch off and go to a competitor. 201d (See correction at end of story.)  Still, a number of companies remain committed to owning and hosting their own software, and despite the tough economic times, they are loath to try something new, especially if it means making additional investments, however meager. What 2019s more, it 2019s not clear that software delivered over the web costs less in the long run. Certainly it 2019s cheaper for the first couple of years, but, asks Gartner analyst Rob DiSisto,  201cwill the expense of upgrading and managing it eventually be higher than the fee you are paying to the provider? 201d  Salesforce also has worked hard to address perhaps the biggest concern of large users: security. Thus far Salesforce has recorded only one security breach, a phishing attack in November 2007. Benioff says all his major customers send auditors to Salesforce to check security, and he personally gives about 100 data-center tours every year in which customers and their auditors literally kick in the doors to make sure that fire alarms go off; they also try to hack into servers.  201cWhat 2019s unusual is that no one else gets this constant drumbeat of security checking, 201d boasts Benioff.  201cBecause of that, we 2019ve got some of the best architecture in the world.  It 2019s not clear software delivered via the net will be cheaper in the long run.  Just as in the rental market for housing, customers have more flexibility when they pay month to month than when they 2019ve invested in huge upfront costs. If their sentiments turn, they can leave easily. If they lay people off, they can simply cut down on the number of subscriptions they buy. To hold on to its customers, Salesforce must be vigilant about staying atop their needs so that it doesn 2019t lose existing business even as it tries to grow. Perhaps that 2019s why Benioff continues to add staff to his sales team, even as tech companies pull back. Last fall, as Google, Intel intc , and Yahoo yhoo laid off workers, Salesforce hired a platform truck to make its way down the Valley 2019s central artery, Highway 101, with a billboard blaring LIFE-CHANGING CAREERS; GAME-CHANGING TECHNOLOGY. It 2019s the kind of audacious come-on people have come to expect from Benioff, only this time no one was rolling his eyes.

            "input": "text:FRANKFURT 2014German sporting goods dynamo Adidas AG was supposed to be celebrating around now, having just sponsored both the World Cup and the winning German team. Instead the company stunned investors with a profit warning Thursday that sent its shares plunging as much as 16%.  Adidas said second-quarter net profit fell 16% from the year-earlier period to  20ac144 million ($193 million). Revenue rose 2% to  20ac3.47 billion. Operating profit fell almost 13% to  20ac220 million.  The company blamed the earnings hit on currency woes, weakening golf-equipment sales, lower consumer spending in Russia and, in a painful twist, the cost of its World Cup marketing. The worsening situation in Russia, which from Friday faces increasing Western sanctions, was prompting Adidas to rethink its strategy there, the company said.  The litany of troubles led Adidas to slash its net profit forecast for the year to around  20ac650 million from a previous range of  20ac830 million to  20ac930 million. The company also said it wouldn't achieve profit targets previously set for next year. In response, the board had taken  strategic decisions  to boost profitability, the company said.   Our goal is very clear: to strengthen our brand for long-term success,  said spokeswoman Katja Schreiber.  At 1425 GMT, Adidas shares traded at  20ac59.56, down 15% from Wednesday's close.   We find the warning alarming  because it shows Adidas must believe it faces enormous pressure, said Deutsche Bank in a research note.  Adidas isn't alone in its troubles. German rival Puma, owned by French luxury giant Kering SA, on Tuesday posted falling sales and profits for the recent quarter, mainly due to currency pressures. Puma launched a turnaround plan after issuing two profit warnings in less than one year, most recently in May 2013. On Tuesday it maintained its earnings forecast.  Puma is trying to revive its brand by launching a big new marketing campaign. It will run until the 2016 Olympic Games and feature some of the brand's top celebrities, including Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, Chief Executive Bj 00f6rn Gulden said Tuesday. But repositioning Puma and the turnaround will take time, he cautioned.  Adidas last year extended its partnership with World Cup organizer FIFA to 2030. Earlier in July, it unseated U.S. rival Nike Inc. from its sponsorship of Manchester United Ltd. Adidas is offering the enormously popular team more than $103 million ahead of the European Championship games in 2016.  Adidas doesn't disclose financial details of its World Cup partnership and hasn't commented on marketing expenses for the games. Consultants estimate it spent at least $150 million on its sponsorship and for marketing linked to this year's games. The impact remains unclear, however.   Nike reported very, very strong World Cup figures and Adidas doesn't seem to be mentioning it,  said Jon Copestake, retail analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit in London. He said many consumers believe Nike was an official World Cup sponsor. Nike only sponsored individual teams.  Away from sponsorships, Adidas said lower consumer spending and higher political risk in Russia and surrounding countries had prompted it to halt plans for new stores there and to close some to  reduce risk and protect profit.  Adidas has roughly 1,000 stores in the region.   We will ask ourselves what investment really makes sense given the risky situation,  Ms. Schreiber said.  Even on sedate American putting greens Adidas faces headaches. Sales of its TaylorMade golf equipment fell 18% in the second quarter compared with the year earlier. The slump appears to be part of a broader trend: U.S. retail chain Dick's Sporting Goods earlier this month said it would lay off more than 400 golf instructors.  Adidas said it would reduce inventory at TaylorMade and begin restructuring. Details of the plan and second-quarter earnings are slated for Aug. 7.  Adidas didn't break out current revenue but in 2013 its sales in Russia and its golf business were roughly equivalent to the  20ac2 billion Adidas expects from soccer sales this year.   2014Ruth Bender and Natali Schwab contributed to this article.

He said he is encouraged by Samsung 2019s public comments that leaders of the South Korean company are receptive to the ideas recently put forward by his firm, Elliott Management Corp.   201cWe are optimistic about that one 2014we think it 2019s a tremendous platform and a tremendous value, 201d Mr. Singer said Tuesday during an appearance at The Wall Street Journal 2019s WSJDLive 2016 global technology conference.  In early October, Elliott disclosed an effort to push Samsung to reshape and simplify its complicated ownership structure, by bundling its various ownership stakes in the other Samsung entities into a new holding company. Mr. Singer said it had also proposed a U.S. stock listing for the company, whose shares have been only traded in South Korea.  Elliott disclosed its effort after Samsung announced its recall of the Galaxy Note 7 but before its decision to kill the product altogether. Mr. Singer said Elliott 2019s efforts to push for changes at Samsung were unrelated to the product problems, which doesn 2019t  201cshake or shatter our belief 201d about the possibility of changes that could reward holders of the company 2019s stock.  Mr. Singer, a billionaire and famed stock picker, founded Elliott in 1977. The firm has become one of the most successful activist hedge funds.  His firm and other activist investors have pushed companies in many industries to make changes aimed at boosting stock prices and rewarding shareholders. Activists have targeted big U.S. tech companies including Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Qualcomm Inc., prodding the companies to buy back more shares and boost dividends.  Elliott and others investors also recently launched a coordinated effort, called the Council for Investor Rights and Corporate Accountability, or Circa, to make the case to lawmakers and the American public that their investment strategy is beneficial to companies and the U.S. economy.  Their push follows criticism by politicians that include Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who last year proposed changing the tax code to crack down on  201chit and run 201d activists.  Mr. Singer said that the short-term image is misplaced, when it comes to Elliott. He says his firm typically holds stakes in companies for two years, compared with the one-and-a-half years he said is the average for other institutional investors.  He said his firm does extensive research before deciding to take positions in companies.  201cWe don 2019t just show up, 201d he said.  Mr. Singer said one of its most successful efforts was at Citrix Systems Inc., a software company that he said had made a series of ill-conceived acquisitions and other steps that had destroyed shareholder value. After reaching a settlement with the company in 2015, Elliott pushed for change that included replacing Citrix 2019s chief executive. Jesse Cohn, who leads Elliott 2019s activist efforts, took the rare step of joining Citrix 2019s board.  Mr. Singer said he is very excited about the potential at Citrix now.  201cFor the last couple of quarters the revenues in its core product have grown, 201d he said.

It was every day, every single day,  the 60-year-old woman told the Victorian Supreme Court of the abuse she suffered from John Reed.  Mr Reed died in hospital in July last year aged 63 after a fight with Ms Dunlop in their Seaford flat.  She was charged with his murder but was acquitted by a Victorian Supreme Court jury on Thursday after they heard of the catalogue of violence she endured for decades. She was also acquitted of his manslaughter.  Ms Dunlop had hit a low point in her troubled life when she met Mr Reed in the late 1980s.  Her nine-week-old son had just died of SIDS.   We were soul mates straight away,  Ms Dunlop,60, said.   He showed me love, cuddles, I felt safe and I felt secure with him.   But she didn't forsee then that her low point was about to get even lower.  Her childhood had been characterised by alcohol-fuelled violence, with her mother  covered in bruises all the time .  Her father had never been affectionate - she said - and she was lonely when Mr Reed came into her life.   He asked me the next day would I be his lady and I said yes.   Soon after, Mr Reed said this to her:  If you love someone set them free. If they don't come back, hunt them down and kill them.   He was beginning to change, but  I was too blind to see it , she said.   (He) was already isolating me from people and very controlling and everything that I did he controlled.   If I spoke to a male or spoke to a friend he just got so jealous, like I was his.   In one incident, described by Ms Dunlop to the court, he threw her over a balcony.   I've managed just to grab on to the concrete part and I was begging him to get me up,  Ms Dunlop said.   He's just looking at me, `Get yourself up, you bitch.   Whenever somebody asked questions about Ms Dunlop's appearance they would move.  By the time of Mr Reed's death they had lived in between 40 and 50 houses.  Their daughter Mika was born in 1990.  One night when  Mika was only a babe in arms  he started yelling for money, punching the wall, shouting  If you don't f***n' give me that card ... I'll kill you .  When Mika was five he broke a glass in Ms Dunlop's arm, dragged her over jagged paving - leaving a trail of blood - and threw her in a wheely bin.  She wasn't allowed to go anywhere without him and developed a  phobia  of people.  If she made doctors' appointments, he would cancel them.  Police attended their Seaford flat on July 1 last year to find Ms Dunlop with a bloodied head.  On July 18, they fought again.  As Ms Dunlop tried to escape Mr Reed grabbed her and said,  You're going f****n' nowhere, you bitch   Ms Dunlop described a look on his face that she'd seen before.   It's just like everything just drains away and he just looks like the devil,  she said.   I know that look, that I'm in for one hell of a beating or dead.   He was still leaning over her when she grabbed a footstool, turned and hit him over the head, twice.   I just wanted to stop him so I could get out the door,  she said.

The crowd estimated by organisers at 200,000 packing a large square in downtown Seoul on Saturday was much smaller than in recent weeks but festive, with music between speeches calling for Park's early removal.   We demand the Constitutional Court make a decision of conscience and justice and do not act against the will of the people,  Jung Kang-ja, one of the leaders of a coalition of civic groups backing the rally, said.  Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, who became acting president late on Friday after the impeachment vote, called for rallies to be peaceful and sought to calm anxiety over national security and reassure financial markets   Financial and foreign exchange markets have been relatively stable and there are no signs of unusual movements by the North but all public servants should bear vigilance in mind as they conduct their duties,  Hwang said.  Park's powers were suspended after 234 of parliament's 300 members voted to impeach her, meaning more than 60 members of her own party backed the motion against her.  The impeachment, which has to be reviewed and approved by the Constitutional Court within 180 days to remove Park from office, sets the stage for her to become the country's first elected leader to be ousted in disgrace.  The 64-year-old daughter of a former military ruler, is accused of colluding with a friend and a former aide, both of whom prosecutors have indicted, to pressure businesses to donate to foundations set up to back her policies.  Park, who is serving a single five-year term ending in February 2018, has denied wrongdoing but apologised for carelessness in her ties with her friend, Choi Soon-sil.  For seven consecutive weekends, huge crowds have gathered in central Seoul in demonstrations calling for Park to step down.  The candle-lit rallies have been peaceful, with parents bringing children and many demonstrators using smartphone apps with candlelight images and maps for bathrooms.  If Park leaves office early, an election must be held within 60 days.

Molinaro told an out of sessions court hearing on Sunday night.   It's going to be my mum's last Christmas, please.   The 30-year old was hit with 35 charges, including commercial trafficking of ice and GHB, as well as selling guns.  Police allegedly found 3D printed guns at Molinaro's home, along with regular guns, and said he was the kingpin of the drug operation.  Molinaro said he had  a little plan  to go to a drug detox facility in Toorak if he got bail.   Which my grandparents said they would pay for me... I just never took them up on the offer,  he said.  Co-accused Patrick Arena,43, was allegedly financing Molinaro's operation, but he told the court he only bought so much ice because he could afford it for personal use.  Arena and Molinaro allegedly used emojis as a code for drug orders - a bottle for GHB, and a bowl for ice.  Police also allegedly found $49,000 in cash, ice, magic mushrooms, IDs, 11 silver bars and a gold ingot at a property linked to another co-accused, Andy Pantzoglou.   I'm not a stupid boy, I know how serious this is going to be,  the 26-year-old Pantzoglou said in court.

A 60-day interim ban came into effect in the four states on Wednesday.  The decorative burners, filled with methylated spirits, ethanol or bio fuel, have caused 113 reported injuries and 115 fires in Australia since 2010.  They can be freestanding or sit atop furniture.  Retailers and online traders must take the banned products off their shelves or delete them from online catalogues immediately.  Those who continue to sell them will face steep penalties of up to $220,000 for individuals and $1.1 million for corporations.  People with ethanol-fuelled burners at home are advised to stop using them immediately.  The ban doesn't apply to fixed alcohol-fuelled fireplaces, products used in the heating or warming of food, or products with a power output of more than 4.5kW.  The federal government is moving towards a national ban on the advice of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.  Federal Small Business Minister Michael McCormack says despite previous warnings by the watchdog, significant injuries are still occurring, including second- or third-degree burns.

            "input": "text:By FERNANDA SANTOS in Virginia Beach KATE BERRY in Capistrano Beach, Calif. and TRACY CONNOR in New York DAILY NEWS WRITERS With Donna Petrozzello  Sunday, January 12th 2003, 1:80AM  He's hardly an average Joe.  The spin on Evan Marriott, star of the smash hit reality TV series  Joe Millionaire,  is that he's just an ordinary construction worker content to scrape by on $19,000  Although he poses as the $50 million man for a gaggle of gold-digging women on Fox each week, he really had a  humble  upbringing and lives in  poverty,  the story line goes.  But a peek into Marriott's background reveals the 28-year-old green-eyed hunk is more Hollywood than hardhat.  Marriott's father is a banker, he was raised in a gated community, attended a pricey private school and vacationed in Europe.  Barely out of his teens, he was signed by a top modeling agency in New York and worked with a famed fashion photographer, living in a W. 68th St. pad with other models.  And while he does drive a bulldozer - he was even back at work on Friday - he set his sights on showbiz, trying to break into wrestling and acting.   I wouldn't say it's a rags-to-riches story,  said Kevin McKeon, who went to high school with Marriott.  The home where Marriott grew up isn't some swamp shack, but a tidy, two-story Colonial on a half-acre lot at Great Neck Farms, an upper-middle class area of Virginia Beach.  His father, Robert, is a senior vice president at Old Dominion Trust and his mother, Charlotte, has a job at the fanciest linen shop in town, Yves Delorme.  Marriott went to local public schools until seventh grade, when he was packed off to Hargrave Military Academy, a $12,000-a-year boarding school for rambunctious teens.  The ex-Marines and retired Army officers couldn't stifle young Evan's spirit.   He was kind of the class clown. He had a hard time knowing when to be serious,  said McKeon, recalling Marriott as a prankster who booby-trapped doors with water buckets.  His dark good looks also made him popular.   I remember that girls were chasing after him even back then,  McKeon said.  In his junior year, he jetted off to England and France for 10 days with his school chums. In the classroom, he had trouble buckling down.   I know he had problems with studying and that he struggled a lot academically,  said ex-classmate Robert Petty.  College wasn't in the cards. After graduation, he went to Paris to break into modeling, but was back in Virginia within a year.   It didn't pan out for him,  said Kathy Keeny, a Virginia Beach photographer who met Marriott when he returned from Europe looking for work.  Keeny and fashion editor Kim Wadsworth set him up with his first paid gig, four shoots at $50 a pop. But the strapping stud seemed more interested in beef than beefcake.   He said, 'Man, you guys should try the steak fajita. I wish I could have one right now,'  Keeny remembers.   He likes hanging out, drinking beer, watching football and working construction,  Wadsworth said.  Just a regular guy.   A little too regular for Tanya Tyrrell,30, who dated Marriott briefly about seven years ago when he was working for his godfather's construction firm in Virginia Beach.   He's a really nice guy with a good heart, but he can't hold a conversation,  Tyrrell said.   A little flighty is a nice way of putting it. I guess you could say he's two wings short of a bucket.   Marriott had no trouble meeting women.   In Virginia Beach, he didn't go unnoticed. If he walked into a bar, women would walk right up to him,  Tyrrell said.  But once you started talking to him, it was like, 'Never mind.'   Marriott's striking looks didn't go unnoticed by the fashion world, either.  He sent his pictures around New York, and a premier agency, Click, liked what it saw. They signed him in 1994.  His chiseled features caught the eye of Bruce Weber. He also worked for Macy's, Calvin Klein and catalogues, said Click President Joey Grill.  He lived in the Click models' apartment on W. 68th St. and worked as a doorman at the Paramount Hotel between shoots.  Ever the practical joker, he would call the Click offices using fake voices and names, and tell people he was the heir to the Marriott hotel fortune.   He was one of the most delightful, funny, charming guys I ever represented,  said his booker, Jules Birnbaum.  But his 6-foot-5 frame was an impediment to fashion work, and after two years, Marriott quit Manhattan for Los Angeles to give acting a try.  Modeling left  a bad taste in my mouth,  Marriott told the Daily News.  His success on the West Coast was more modest. He worked construction, sculpted his body at Gold's Gym in Venice, Calif., and went on auditions.  In March 2000, he landed a part as  Mover No. 1  on  Days of Our Lives.   The next year he pocketed $1,000 to pose in racy underwear - gladiator briefs, anyone? - for the California Muscle catalogue.  In May 2001, he enrolled in classes at Ultimate University, a $125-a-month school for wanna-be professional wrestlers, using the nickname Duke Elder.   After a few months, we put him on scholarship because he was one of the four or five most natural guys I'd ever met,  said coach Rick Bassman.  For seven months, his schedule was building-demolition by day and smackdowns by night.   He had some financial struggles, but he wasn't on the brink of poverty,  Bassman said.  His shot at stardom in the squared circle was cut short by a bigger break, when he met a producer for  Joe Millionaire  at a Christmas party in 2001.  The popularity of the show has fueled speculation that the audience is somehow being hoodwinked, along with the women on the show, that Marriott may be hiding assets. Rumors of his background have floated onto Internet discussion groups and radio talk shows.  Fox says it didn't pay Marriott for his work on  Joe Millionaire,  where he tries to con 20 women into believing he's a multimillionaire aristocrat with a castle in the French countryside.  Which could explain why he showed up for work at R.B. Holt Inc., a construction firm in Capistrano Beach, five days after the first episode aired.  Holt office manager Amy Houlihan said that after his run at reality TV, Marriott wanted a dose of actual reality.  I think he just wanted to get back to work.  Summary: A REGULAR GUY? OH, THAT'S RICH 'Joe Millionaire' a model and actor FOX-TV Twenty women (inset) are vying to get close to  Joe Millionaire star, Evan Marriott.

Calland, is the first American-born executive chef at the popular Tuscan restaurant, which built its reputation on featuring women chefs from the regional kitchens of Italy. And while Calland trained in Italy and traveled extensively throughout the Mediterranean, she does bring her American heritage to the stove at Le Madri.   I was born in Indianapolis and grew up in the southernmost part of the Corn Belt,  she recalls.  My father used to bring home bags of corn still warm from the fields and it was my job to shuck them. I still remember how intoxicating that corn was.   That memory inspired a seasonal delight, pan-seared diver scallops with summer corn chowder. Calland, who loves to showcase fish at the restaurant, admits that  scallops and lobster constitute my favorite food group. There's a lot of flavor here without a lot of fuss.   Although the dish may look complicated, most of the work can be done in advance, says Calland. The corn puree that forms a flavorful bed for the scallops can be made a day ahead. The only last minute  work,  notes the chef, is briefly roasting a half-cup of corn kernels  just enough to bring out the flavor  and quickly searing the scallops in a hot skillet. *  Le Madri, 168 W. 18th St.; (212) 727-8022  - The bacon. A little goes a long way, so get high-quality, double (not single) processed bacon for this dish. The smoky flavor comes from two smokings.  - The scallops. Diver scallops are hand- harvested.  It isn't imperative that the scallops be diver, but they must at least be dry-packed, meaning they're not processed, so they will caramelize nicely and taste best,  says Calland. For a change, try this preparation with roasted lobster tail, sliced into medallions.  Pan-Seared Diver Scallops With Summer Corn Chowder.  Serves 2 as a main course, 4 as an appetizer.  2 1 2 cups of corn kernels, cut from cobs of 6 fresh, sweet ears.  2 large Yukon gold potatoes, peeled  4 slices double smoked bacon  Canola oil for coating skillet  1 tablespoon parsley, coarsely chopped  Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste  Extra-virgin olive oil for roasting corn kernels  1 1 2 pounds large diver scallops, cleaned.  8 chives, preferably garlic, tops reserved, thinly sliced  Reserve a half-cup of the corn. Combine the remaining corn with the heavy cream in a heavy- bottomed saucepan; heat gently until just under a boil. Remove pot from the heat and set aside in a cool place to steep for 30 minutes.  Wash the potatoes well. Using a sharp knife, cut them lengthwise in thirds. Cut these rectangles lengthwise in thirds again, then dice potatoes into cubes. Place them in a small pot and cover with cold water. Cook gently until the water just begins to boil. Add salt to taste and cook 1 minute more. Strain potatoes and set aside.  Cut bacon into small dice. Heat a small heavy skillet. When warm, add a scant amount of oil. When the oil is warm, add the bacon and render it until crisp. Take off the bacon and, using a strainer, pour off and reserve the fat. Wipe the skillet with a paper towel and return it to the stove. Add the bacon fat and, when it's hot, add the potatoes. They will brown very quickly so have a paper towel-lined plate nearby. Gently stir potatoes so they don't stick. Using a slotted spoon, remove them to the plate as soon as they begin to color. Set potatoes aside; discard hot fat.  In a blender, puree the corn mixture. With the back of a spoon, press puree through a wide-mesh strainer; discard corn hulls. Season puree with salt and pepper as needed.  To finish dish: Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Place a baking sheet in the oven to heat. Toss reserved corn with extra-virgin olive oil just to coat the kernels. Season to taste and pour corn onto hot baking pan. Roast to bring out flavor, until corn just begins to cook, about 5 minutes. Add the reserved potatoes and bacon and cook until crisp, about 2-3 minutes. Remove from oven and keep warm until ready to serve.  Heat a nonstick skillet on the stove. Season scallops well with salt and pepper. When the pan is hot, add a small amount of canola oil to just cover the bottom of the pan and heat. Add the scallops, being careful not to crowd them, and sear. When scallops have browned on one side, turn them and cook 1 minute more. Remove scallops from pan, draining them on a paper towel. Warm corn puree; recheck seasonings; add parsley and stir.  Spoon puree onto warmed plates. Spoon warmed bacon, potatoes and roasted corn on puree; top with scallops. Sprinkle dish with chives and serve. Summary: The newest  mama at Le Madri, Pippa S.

            "input": "text:Several stars have come forward recently with casting couch tales, saying they were appalled and shocked they were asked for sexual favors in order to get coveted jobs in Hollywood.  But for all of the talk of outrage, few of the alleged perpetrators have been named. In fact, a number of entertainment industry experts and insiders declined to even comment on the hot-button issue when approached by FoxNews.com.  So why are entertainment pros mum when it comes to sexual predators in Hollywood?   201cActors don 2019t name names for several reasons. Many times it is because they want to move on from that unpleasant experience, or perhaps they succumbed to it, or the  2018perpetrator 2019 was so huge that they do not want to defame that person because they think highly of their work, 201d Los Angeles-based celebrity psychologist, Dr. Nancy Irwin, told FOX411 2019s Pop Tarts column.  201cOthers don 2019t want to be labeled a  2018snitch 2019 or feel nobody will believe them because it is such a clich 00e9. Sadly, the clich 00e9 does perpetuate, probably because the creative process in and of itself can be a seductive process, and the temptation is non-stop in Hollywood. 201d  Hollywood-based career strategist Suzannah Galland said she hears many horror stories from friends who are top actresses. These victims don 2019t name names  201cout of fear, 201d but she says code of silence can turn tragic.   201cTwo (friends) have told me of date rapes perpetrated by major male stars. In both cases, these women agreed to a friendly dinner, 201d she said.  201cOne of these friends had no interest in a romantic relationship at all with the star that was pursuing her, and she made that clear to him. All the same she was in awe of the man 2019s talent, and happy to discuss possible roles with him. An alliance would have been hugely helpful to her career. So she was trusting when he invited her after dinner to stop by his hotel, where he had a stack of scripts to show her. Once the door was shut, he raped her.  2019I never told anybody, 2019 she explained to me,  2018because he is who he is and I was ashamed. 2019 201d  Another friend confided to Galland that she was approached by an award-winning actor she found attractive. However, when she went back to his place to  201cdiscuss scripts, 201d things took an ugly turn.   201cEven though she was willing to be romanced, that never happened. He beat her then raped her. She spent years in recovery, conflicted and ashamed, 201d Galland explained.  201cShe made no public complaint. 2019 201d  According to Irwin, by not revealing the predators, celebrities are contributing to the problem and putting others at risk of becoming the next victim.   201cI always encourage actors to file a complaint anonymously through the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) because they care about this issue deeply, 201d she said.  201cIt is up to talent to set the boundary and disallow abuse. If this happens enough, and SAG disciplines the abuser, hopefully they will seek the professional help they need to halt this inappropriate and damaging behavior. 201d  SAG National Director of Affirmative Action and Diversity, Adam Moore, said that despite gains made over the years toward workplace equality, performers still often face workplace discrimination and sexual harassment on set or during auditions.   201cNeither discrimination nor harassment is your fault. When you see or become a victim of discrimination or harassment, don 2019t ignore it and don 2019t pretend it did not happen -- let someone know, 201d Moore advised, adding that the issue is taken incredibly seriously by the union.  201cHave no fear that this will get out to the industry: your call is entirely confidential and nothing will be done without your express consent. Every action taken against this behavior means it is less likely to be repeated. You have a responsibility to yourself and your fellow Guild members to see that all performers are treated with respect in the job search and in the workplace. 201d  If SAG deems a complaint appropriate, the Guild sends a copy of their policy along with a letter advising the alleged perpetrator of the complaint, and demands that the production company involved investigate the concern and take immediate action to remedy any inappropriate conduct.  Someone might want to tell some of today 2019s top stars about SAG 2019s complaint process.  Megan Fox told British GQ that she was  201cheartbroken 201d over the number of legendary Hollywood directors that had tried to bed her since she found fame. Lisa Rinna claimed she missed out on a role in a prominent television series because she refused to give a producer  201ca quickie. 201d Gwyneth Paltrow recently told Elle Magazine that when she was just starting out it was suggested that a business meeting be finished in the bedroom. In an interview with People magazine, Charlize Theron divulged that in her modeling days, she was invited to a well-known director 2019s home for a casting call  2013 only to find him in his pajamas mixing drinks. And in her best-selling book  201cSuck It, Wonder Woman! 201d Olivia Munn dished out a jaw-dropping supply of stories from sleeping with a famous director in her rookie days to visiting an agent 2019s home who had a collage of vaginas on his wall.  And it 2019s not just women.   I can tell you that the No. 1 problem in Hollywood was and is and always will be pedophilia,  80 2019s sensation Corey Feldman told ABC's  Nightline  last August.  That's the biggest problem for children in this industry... It's the big secret.   Hollywood publicist Angie Meyer urges victims, famous or not, to come forward and name names.   201cTo set a precedent, just one person needs to come forward to ignite an investigation, and involve authorities, 201d she said.  201cIn order for these perpetrators to become fearful of consequence  2013 the ramifications must be so severe that they risk losing more than their reputations, job and any continuous Hollywood career. 201d  But former theatrical agent and founder of online casting service GotCast.com, Alec Shankman, said that as long as celebrities continue to their stories  2013 even without exposing the culprit  2013 they are still helping to curb the problem.   201cHollywood is a very small community and careers are very volatile, so often people feel that the risks and making waves in the community might outweigh the desire to speak out and name names, 201d he explained.  201cUnfortunately, it is unlikely that the behavior can be stopped entirely. Much like sexual harassment in the workplace, it is an ongoing issue. But as long as young, new talent are properly educated and informed about all of the legitimate ways to reach success, they will be more likely to avoid any of the less legitimate opportunities that might present themselves.

            "input": "text:Often overlooked as a necessity to many, the calves are an essential component in building stronger and more proportional looking legs. Formally called the gastrocnemius, the calf muscle is located on the back of your leg between your knee and ankle.  The calf muscle has two heads called the medial head and the lateral head 2013diametrically opposed to the gastrocnemius and soleus. This muscle is primarily responsible for the plantar flexion of the ankle and the flexion of the knee. There's another muscle that's often mislabeled as being part of the calf muscle and that's the soleus. This muscle is located outside of the gastrocnemius, also assists in the plantar flexion of the ankle, and plays a significant role in most calf exercises.  Seated Calf Raise The seated calf raise works both the calf muscle and the soleus. To begin, sit on the machine and place your feet on the platform below. Make sure only your toes are on the foot platform while your heels are hanging off. There's an adjustable thigh pad that needs to be lowered until it's firmly positioned against your thighs. On top of the thigh pad there are two hand grips to hold on to while performing the exercise.  Once you are properly positioned, push up on your toes so the weighted lever is lifted off its rack. Then reach down to the side of you and pull the safety lever so that the rack is moved out of the way. Now slowly lower your heels as you begin to feel the weight on your calves as they become fully stretched. Next, push up on your toes as high as you can go and briefly pause at the top before returning back down. Repeat this movement for the desired amount of sets and repetitions.  Once finished, push up on your toes and then pull the safety lever back into its original position so you can rack the weight. Make sure you keep the movement slow and under control. Do not perform the repetitions at a fast pace as it could lead to ankle or calf injuries.  Standing Calf Raise Standing calf raises have a few variations but the most standard method of this exercise is using a standing calf raise machine. Adjust the shoulder pads to compensate for your height. Step up onto the foot stand with your toes and the balls of your feet on the foot stand, leaving your heels hanging off. Make sure your shoulders are firmly placed under the shoulder pads, your torso is straight and your knees have a slight bend.  To begin, push upward on your toes and momentarily pause at the top of your movement. Slowly return the weight down until your heels are hanging off the foot stand. Repeat this movement for the desired amount of sets and repetitions. Always keep the weight under control throughout the entire movement. Never lock your knees during this exercise as it could lead to injury. If you suffer any lower back pain then choose another calf exercise as this one places significant pressure on the lower back.  Dumbbells and barbells can be used instead of the machine for standing calf raises. The movement is performed the same but you have to find an elevated foot stand or an aerobics step to allow for your heels to hang off.  Leg Press Calf Raise The leg press calf raise involves the usage of a standard leg pres machine in which you push upward at a 45 degree angle. This exercise can be done with one leg or both legs. To begin, sit in the machine with your back and head against the back rest. Your upper body should make a 90-degree angle with your legs as you position sit down. Next, place your toes and the balls of your feet at the bottom of the foot platform. Push the weight up with your toes and release the safety levers which will place all of the weight on your feet and legs. Do not lock out your knees when pushing the foot platform as this could lead to possible knee injuries.  Slowly lower the weight until your heels are lowered and your ankles are bent. You will feel a significant stretch on the calves at this point. Repeat this movement for the desired amount of sets and repetitions. Always keep the weight under control as you slowly perform the exercise.  ThePostGame brings you the most interesting sports stories on the web.

            "input": "text:THIS OCTOBER, A ROMANTIC EPIC titled  The Piano,  written and directed by a New Zealander named Jane Campion, will be the grand finale of the New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center. In November it will open all over the country.  The Piano,  which is set in 19th-century New Zealand, has already made Campion the first woman to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, and the reviews so far -- but for a cavil about its being too consciously an  art  film -- have been ecstatic. Vincent Canby of The New York Times, for instance, described  The Piano  as  a triumph . . . so good, so tough, so moving and, especially, so original.  Yet when I asked a friend, like me a great admirer of Campion's work, what she wanted to learn from my interview with the film maker, she replied,  First, I want to know if she's sane.   I had expected curiosity about why Australia, where Campion went to film school and lives, has produced what seems to be an inordinate number of world-class directors: Bruce Beresford and Peter Weir and George Miller among them. Or why, given the hen's tooth scarcity of prominent female directors anywhere in the world, three -- Campion, Gillian Armstrong and Jocelyn Moorhouse -- emerged from a country associated with a certain cheerful misogyny. But why be curious about Campion's sanity?   Because,  my friend answered,  she's obsessed with lunatic women.   In truth, only the eponymous protagonist of Campion's first feature film, the extraordinary  Sweetie,  is genuinely mad. The New Zealand novelist Janet Frame, whose autobiography,  An Angel at My Table,  became Campion's second film, was only thought to be mad. Diagnosed in her early 20's as a schizophrenic and institutionalized, she was within inches of a lobotomy when her doctors decided that a woman who had managed to write and publish distinguished fiction while in the bin was probably not in need of a brain correction. Ada in  The Piano  isn't mad either, but her mulishness approaches sublimity. That Ada doesn't speak, for instance, isn't because she can't but because she will not.  Lunatic women? Except for the simultaneously hilarious and tragic Sweetie, no. But powerful women, which in some minds may add up to the same thing? Yes. Sweetie has a tornado's destructiveness, Janet Frame stayed sane in the midst of madness and Ada's will is iron. What roles!  If artists looked like their creations, the progenitor of  The Piano  would resemble a Bronte sister or George Eliot. Instead, Campion looks like a commercial for Fun and Sun in Australia. Her hair is very fair, her eyes are very blue and her speech -- typically antipodean in its narrow vowels and the upward curve of its sentences -- is spattered with self-mockery and great bursts of laughter.  Mum  and  Dad  are a big part of her conversation; so are her friends, whom one half-expects her to call, as do most of the residents of her part of the world,  mates.   On a day in mid-June of this year, Campion was a month away from having won the Palme d'Or. She was two weeks away from giving birth to her first child, a son whose presence was already inescapable in the Sydney apartment she shares with her husband, Colin Englert, a television producer and director. The baby's crib was set up in Englert's small office, and Campion lifted her billowy white shirt once to stare at her swollen belly.  Is he kicking?  her visitor asked.  Mmmmm,  she answered, lost for a moment in that curious bubble that encloses the pregnant.  Campion was, in brief, at the pinnacle of her particular world, at a place where the professional and the personal were about to meet in blessed convergence. And although she'd done her share of interviews, she wasn't yet weary of the same old questions because she hadn't yet heard them all. Chatty, spontaneous (once, she unexpectedly kissed my cheek), Campion in June of 1993 was, to an interviewer, equivalent to an unplowed field.  CAMPION WAS BORN 39 YEARS AGO, TO parents whom she describes as having had  a strange life compared to most New Zealanders.  They had a strange life compared with almost everybody's.   My mother was an heiress, but an orphan at the same time, so she was brought up by different people and finally given her inheritance,  she said.  She and my father met at university, then went to England to study at the Old Vic. When they came back, they started the first official touring company in New Zealand. It wasn't a financial success at all, and so they just started working in other established theaters. Mother retired when she had the three of us, but Dad's still doing a lot of things, like opera.   At Victoria University, where she majored in anthropology, Campion was interested in acting.  But I felt I had to distinguish myself from the family. You know? Besides, I thought acting quite frivolous. Now I'm grateful that I was raised in an atmosphere which had some sort of gaiety to it. But at the time, I thought that these people were . . . insincere.   After that, the thing was to try and travel and take a look at where I came from, along with the rest of Europe. You know?

            "input": "text:By Mark Lebetkin The Active Times  Can yoga make you smarter? It 2019s not as much of a stretch as you think.  A recent study out of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign tested this idea on 30 female college students and found that just 20 minutes of yoga enabled them to better complete mental tasks that involve the speed and accuracy of their working memory and other important measures of cognitive performance.  In fact, as a brain booster, yoga outperformed an intense bout of aerobic exercise, which has already been shown to have positive effects on the brain.   201cIt appears that following yoga practice, the participants were better able to focus their mental resources, process information quickly, more accurately and also learn, hold and update pieces of information more effectively than after performing an aerobic exercise bout, 201d said lead researcher Neha Gothe in a press release.  Although there may be many reasons for the results, Gothe believes that yoga's focus on mindfulness may be an important factor.  201cThe breathing and meditative exercises aim at calming the mind and body and keeping distracting thoughts away while you focus on your body, posture or breath,  she said.  Maybe these processes translate beyond yoga practice when you try to perform mental tasks or day-to-day activities.   This is a reverse triangle pose. Start the same way, but when you bend your torso to the right, bring your left arm down instead of your right. Either grip your shin, or rest your left hand on a block or the floor if you 2019re flexible enough. Lift your right arm vertically, and either look up at your right thumb, or straight ahead (that is, behind you) if you're less advanced. Hold for up to one minute, then switch sides.  Start on all fours. Hands should be shoulder distance apart with fingers spread and legs should be hip distance apart. Tuck your toes under and begin to lift your knees off the ground. When you knees are lifted about 12 inches, press your chest towards your legs and straighten your legs and arms as much as possible. Initially, you may not be able to reach full extension due to tight shoulders or hamstrings. If this is the case, allow the legs to stay slightly bent, keeping the chest moving toward your thighs. If your shoulders are tight, try turning your fingers slightly to the sides to create a little more space. Hold for up to one minute, relax in child 2019s pose, then repeat.  Kneel with your legs hip-width apart, shins and top of feet flat on the floor. Your thighs, back and neck should form a straight line perpendicular to the floor. Place your palms against your lower back, and slowly begin to arch your upper back, keeping your lower back as straight as possible. Reach back with one hand and hold onto that foot's heel; then rotate slightly and do the same with the other hand, so that you 2019re now propping yourself against your feet. Don't bend your head back all the way, or you could cut off circulation and make yourself dizzy and nauseous. Use your neck muscles to keep your head from tilting too far, and tuck your chin if necessary. Hold for up to one minute, relax in child 2019s pose, and then repeat one more time.  Start from a kneeling pose, sitting on your heels with your legs and feet together, back and neck straight, and rest your arms over your knees. Reach back and lightly grip your heels with your thumbs on the outside. Exhaling, bend your torso over your thighs so that your forehead touches the mat; and then, inhaling, lift your hips so that your weight is resting lightly on the crown of your head. Concentrate on holding the position for up to two minutes.  This 12-part sequence is to be done continuously, at a natural pace. Begin in mountain pose. Press your palms together in a prayer position and lift your arms over your head into upward salute (urdhva hastasana), arching your back slightly. Bend forward into standing forward bend (see above). Then, arch your torso slightly away from your legs and lift your head so it 2019s facing forward.  From the previous pose, bring one leg back into a lunge, and then bring the next foot back so that your feet are hip-width apart. Your palms should be flat on the ground, hands facing forward, wrists bent 90 degrees. Straighten your back so that you 2019re in plank pose -- legs, spine and neck should form a line. Bend your arms to lower your body into four-limbed staff pose (chaturanga dandasana) and touch your knees to the ground.  From four-limbed staff pose, lower your pelvis to the ground and arch your torso upward so that you enter upward-facing dog (urdhva mukha svanasana). Roll back into downward-facing dog on an exhale.  On an inhale, step one foot forward between your hands into a lunge and perform the first three poses in reverse: standing forward bend, upward salute, and mountain pose. Repeat the sun salutation sequence once or twice more.  A true lotus pose, with each foot on top of opposing thigh and knees to the ground, is difficult, if not impossible, for most beginners -- and can cause injury if done incorrectly. Instead, sit cross legged, straighten your back, place your hands on your knees with palms up and thumb and forefinger together. Close your eyes and focus on deep breathing. Hold for four minutes.

Note: The sequence of poses is the same, but the poses themselves may be slightly modified from those used in the study. As with all poses, it's best to practice these with a certified yoga instructor before trying them on your own. If you have any injuries, check first with your instructor or a physical therapist.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has indicated that reinstating the lifeline for jobless Americans will be at the top of the agenda when the Senate reconvenes next year. House Republicans won 2019t extend the safety net program without a price, however. On Wednesday, Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, made clear he would only bring an extension to the floor  201cas long as long as it 2019s paid for and as long as there are other efforts that will help get our economy moving once again. 201d  That 2019s where Van Hollen 2019s plan comes in. He would insist that unemployment insurance be  201cpaid for 201d with the cuts already baked into the 2013 Farm Bill, a sweeping piece of omnibus legislation which covers farm subsidies, food stamps, and a host of other crucial nutrition and agricultural programs. The Senate Farm Bill would save an estimated $24 billion over the next decade, whereas extending emergency unemployment insurance for another year would cost $25 billion.  Nonetheless, Van Hollen believes holding up the Farm Bill provides the Democrats with  201ca potential pressure point, 201d because the law subsidizes dairy production, keeping milk prices far lower than they otherwise would be. The House passed a temporary Farm Bill extension on Wednesday to prevent dairy prices from skyrocketing, but Reid has said there will be no stopgap measures coming out of the Senate.  If Congress did fund balancing an unemployment insurance extension with cuts out of the 2013 Farm Bill, that could mean that aid for the jobless came at the expense of billions in cuts for food stamp recipients. One of the hot points of contention in the Farm Bill conference committee has been over the size of potential cuts to the food stamp program: Whereas the Senate version of the bill cuts $4.1 billion over the next decade, House Republicans want to slice as much as much as $39 billion.  A spokesperson for Van Hollen said the representative would not support a Farm Bill which includes unacceptably high food stamp cuts, even if the money from those cuts went to fund unemployment insurance. In recent weeks, more and more Democrats have expressed a willingness to kill the Farm Bill outright in order to prevent further cuts to food stamps.   201cCongressman Van Hollen believes the cuts to the food stamp program proposed by House Republicans are far too damaging, and will oppose the final farm bill package if those cuts are too deep, 201d a spokesperson for Van Hollen told msnbc via email.  201cBut if the Farm Bill is acceptable on its own merits, he believes the savings from cuts to agricultural subsidies and other parts of the bill should go to extend unemployment compensation. Why wouldn 2019t we reinvest all of those savings to help families trying to make ends meet? 201d  The Farm Bill conference committee has not yet released a final version of the bill, but the latest reports say the law will likely include about $8 billion in cuts to the food stamp program and LIHEAP, a subsidiary program which provides energy assistance to low-income families. Those cuts may prove unacceptably high to some Democrats. In June, some House Republicans voted against a version of the bill that would have cut $20.5 billion out of food stamps, because those cuts were not large enough. Summary: The former head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee says Democrats should block the farm bill unless they get unemployment insurance extended.",

The thermometer on the car is reading -22C. Outside, we are standing in snow up to my knees. We 2019re in a region called Inari in Finnish Lapland, inside the Arctic Circle, the nearest town is some kilometres to the south of us. You would be forgiven for thinking you were in Narnia, next to a frozen lake and surrounded by snow-topped pine trees. I can see more stars then I have ever seen before and some of the constellations such as Cassiopeia are difficult to spot, the sky is so free from light pollution. Which is supposedly the ideal place to do what I am doing; I 2019m one of a small group of people in search of the Northern Lights.  Our group is just one of many tours in this part of the world, eager to see the lights in all their glory. This type of tourism has become big business, several thousands of people choose to chase the lights every winter. Tour companies in regions such as Scandinavia and Alaska battle to find spots they say offer the best chance to see the elusive show. There are also cruises, and even chartered commercial flights, which travel to Arctic airspace to glimpse the phenomenon from above the clouds.  Humans have been fascinated by this unpredictable, eerie light show for centuries. It features in cave paintings in France thought to date back 30,000 years. Aristotle was captivated by the lights, calling them  jumping goats . Galileo described them as the dawn of the north, helping to coin the term aurora borealis. Europeans in the Middle Ages believed that the lights signified famine or war, while Native Americans saw them as gods dancing above the sky.  In this part of the world you don 2019t just find tour groups or trips with  201chunters 201d chasing breaks in the cloud, more die-hard astronomy fans and photographers hire their own vehicles to chase the lights away from the tourists.  201cThere is this sort of mystical quality to it, it really does pull you in,  says astronomer and presenter of the Sky at Night, Pete Lawrence, who has photographed the lights around the world. I see what he means: on the horizon, I see a faint white haze starting to build, appearing initially like the Milky Way on a clear night. The beginning of the aurora slowly changes colour and form, taking over larger parts of the sky as the tour group eagerly set up their cameras.  But for such a well-known phenomenon, it 2019s amazing how little we know about the science beyond the basics. Thanks to work by Norwegian physicist Kristian Birkeland at the turn of the 20th Century, what we know is that auroral activity coincides with sunspots  2013 darker, cooler regions of intense magnetic activity on the Sun 2019s surface. Birkeland said that currents flowing through the gas of the upper atmosphere caused the light show; in the same way that our modern-day neon lights work.  201c[Aurora] occur where energised particles coming from the sun interact with the Earth 2019s magnetic field, 201d says Lawrence.  What we also know is that aurora are inextricably linked with the activity of the Sun, and that solar activity appears to go through 11-year cycles. When it is at its most active, the so-called solar maximum, there are more sunspots present, and therefore more flares releasing powerful bursts of energy into space, as well as sprays of hot ionised gases, or plasma, that scientists call the solar wind. In theory, this should lead to bigger and brighter displays; however, it 2019s not quite that clear-cut. At the moment we are heading towards the peak of the current cycle, and Nasa had predicted that the northern lights would be the brightest and most intense for 50 years. But as it 2019s turned out this is a weak solar maximum, according to Mark Lester, who studies Solar Terrestrial Physics at the University of Leicester. And it 2019s not as simple to say we see less aurora during a solar minimum, either. There are two large, shifting ovals of auroral activity around the geomagnetic poles  2013 one in the northern hemisphere, the other in the southern hemisphere (where the Southern Lights, or Aurora Australis can be seen). During a solar minimum what you get is aurora at a contracted aurora oval, so not at the place you imagine it to be at, 201d says Lester.

The company, which was created nearly six years ago as a way to help people find spare rooms and couches to sleep on, is in advanced talks to raise more than $400 million in capital, a round of financing that would value it at more than $10 billion, people briefed on the matter said Thursday.  Such a valuation would surpass that of Hyatt, the 57-year-old hotel stalwart, and make Airbnb the latest technology startup firm to gain an eye-popping net worth. Investors hungry for a piece of the fastest-growing startups have opened their wallets, hoping to get even a small piece of the action before what they hope will be a giant payday.  But Airbnb, a centerpiece of what has become known as  201cthe sharing economy, 201d is also drawing increasing scrutiny from regulators concerned about safety, rental laws, and tax collections. The company has become a point of contention among landlords, too.  Leading the potential new fund-raising round is TPG Growth, the investment firm that already has a stake in the car-ride service Uber, the people briefed on the matter said. Other prospective investors include the Dragoneer Investment Group and T. Rowe Price, one of these people added.  The discussions, which were first reported by The Wall Street Journal, may still fall apart, these people cautioned.  Despite murmurs of a new technology bubble, valuations appear to be rising unchecked. Last month, Facebook  2014 itself worth nearly $170 billion  2014 paid more than $16 billion for the messaging service WhatsApp, a bid that some analysts have described as reasonable given the acquired company 2019s growth prospects. Dropbox, a provider of online storage, has been appraised at about $10 billion, while Palantir, a data analysis firm, has raised money at a $9 billion valuation.   201cWe 2019re seeing valuations go nuts, 201d said Jim Ellis, a lecturer at Stanford 2019s Graduate School of Business.  Even so, Ellis conceded that many of the companies now in the limelight were a far cry from those that rose and fell during the dot-com bubble. Many now have business models that can lead to sustainable revenue and profits.  Airbnb appears to be one of them. Founded in the summer of 2008, the company has since become one of Silicon Valley 2019s most celebrated  2014 and one of its most disruptive. Its marketplace lets people rent out their homes, from couches to entire houses, drawing an estimated 11 million guests in more than 34,000 cities. Summary: Airbnb is close to joining a rarefied group of startups: the 11-digit valuation club. The couch-surfing company is close to raising more than $400 million in a new round of financing, a person briefed on the matter said Thursday. The fund-raising effort would value the six-year-old Airbnb at more than $10 billion.

            "input": "text:Every Friday, The Broadsheet, Fortune 2019s daily newsletter on the most powerful women in business, features an exclusive interview. Today, Caroline Fairchild speaks with former NBCUniversal exec Lauren Zalaznick about the future of her career and of the media industry. You can sign up for The Broadsheet here.  CF: Why did you recently decide to join Refinery29 (a fashion, beauty and lifestyle website) as an official advisor?  LZ: I have been drawn toward the intersection of not only great audience and content, but where audiences and content meet data and technology. Whether it 2019s the Shazam board that I joined officially as a director or Refinery29 which is a formalization of an advisory relationship, it 2019s because it is a business that is healthy, really growing like wildfire and really needs a supercharge or super focus around either high customer growth or high monetization growth.  The stuff I really love is bridging the gap between the new audiences and where they live and the content that still has to be pretty extraordinary to reach specific audiences and breakthrough.  CF: How do you help those companies achieve that?  LZ: What has come into play very recently is people looking for organizational strategy. Whether you are growing your company from 12 to 50 employees, or 50 to 250 or 250 to 1,0, the question is always how do you keep the window open for creativity, growth and monetization without an immediate change in culture and chokehold on growth. Organizing for growth is something that I think is a real experience that I love, and love to bring to new companies. It 2019s also an overlooked one. Everyone talks about strategy and your sphere of contacts and influences, but organizational growth is a basic necessity that is underserved and underutilized.  CF: So what does the future look like for you?  LZ: In my heart of hearts, I just can 2019t get enough of this thing called media. What propelled me to leave the best job in media [referring to her 12-year stint at NBCUniversal] was to be able to dive into and check myself to see if I have a preference for small businesses. The first ten years of my career, I was absolutely not drawn to any sort of traditional job. The next 15 [were with] a big, huge media company with NBCU, but every day of my life for all those years it was amazing to me that I got a paycheck every two weeks. I have no judgment that a startup is better or worse than a big company. In choosing the next path, it is more about who I will get a real kick out of working with rather than what environment I want.  CF: What do you see for the future of the media industry?  LZ: The challenge is that the great media companies today are going to remain the great media companies of the future, but they are going to be joined by the emerging great media companies of today. The great middle is what is going to suffer the most.  If you look at post-World War II, that was wave one with the ride of the private media company, meaning the rise of broadcast. Then 30 years later you see wave two with as the rise of programmatic and distribution cable. Now, about 30 years later again, we are seeing the rise of wave three. Every so often there is a forest fire and the greatest trees stands and the middle is wiped out. Then, a thousand different species erupt from the forest floor. That is how I see the media ecosystem right now.  CF: Speaking of all the new small media players, why did you decide to launch you own weekly newsletter?  LZ: LZSunday Paper grew out of NBCU where I initiated a council of women from many different industries like banking, retail, beauty, media, finance and digital for a conversation about how to tackle the changing landscape and the changing audiences through 2026 marketing and advertising to women. When I left NBCUniversal, it was important to me to keep that dialogue going with this, in my view, to expand the community of women in business outside of the corporate guardrails and bring in a little pop culture, high culture, fascination and humor to it. In the past year I have been working on [the newsletter], it continues to evolve thematically and features of the newsletter have changed but the main point is to keep a very consistent and open dialogue with a very tight, smart and engaged group of business people.  CF: What does the newsletter add to the ever-growing media landscape?  LZ: I 2019m not a journalist, so I am not going to report as a primary source person. It is about offering a different lens. If you look at majorities, you are going to get majority stories. If the majority of CEOs of banks are men and the top of business you going to write about the decision makers and influencers in banking, you are going to write about those men. That 2019s not underserved. Everyone needs to know what is happening at the tops of their industry. What is underserved is not so much reportage on what these women are doing in these industries, but the different voices that emerge around very popular stories 2026 If you want to see how the other half thinks, this is a pretty good window into that. Summary: The former NBCU exec talks about her recent appointment at Refinery29 as well as what the future looks like for the media industry.",

            "input": "text:Ian Hamilton FinlayInverleith House and Ingleby Gallery  Cai Guo-Qiang: Life Beneath the ShadowFruitmarket Gallery  Edinburgh is so claustrophobic at festival time: the crowds, combined with the ever-present danger that a mime artist will appear from nowhere and block your path (I live in fear of mime artists), contrive to make the casual visitor feel shifty, exhausted, oddly hunted. You find yourself looking in vain for a park bench on which to sleep. What a relief, then, to journey out of town to Inverleith House, which sits on the edge of the lush Botanic Garden.  Here, you can see Sentences, the first major exhibition of new work by Ian Hamilton Finlay since 1972 - a show which, for all that it is sharp as a tack, also happens to be tranquil, reflective and very charming. It will make you think; it will make you smile. But most of all, it will act as a balm. I hereby recommend it to harassed fringe directors, their frazzled front rows and the big woman in a hat who elbowed me out of the way at the Scottish National Gallery.  Hamilton Finlay is one of those artists who defy categorisation. Is he a gardener or a poet, a philosopher or a funny kind of sculptor? I find it impossible to say, though he is probably best known for a garden: Little Sparta, which lies 25 miles to the south west of Edinburgh, in the Pentland Hills (a classical garden in a wild setting, Little Sparta references everything from the French Revolution to the Second World War; Sir Roy Strong has called it the only 'really original' garden to have been created since 1945).  What I can tell you, however, is that he works with words to sublime effect, an almost mystical talent that Sentences celebrates in unambiguous fashion. In four empty rooms, the writing is literally on the wall, in red and blue, silver and green. This is more stirring than it sounds: in these airy, white spaces, it is as if a voice - wry, but authoritative - is addressing you from far, far away.  Given the sentences in question, it is apt that you can see the Pentlands from the windows at Inverleith House, dark and brooding beyond the lush, tamed landscape of the Botanic Garden. Hamilton Finlay is much concerned with the interplay between order and disorder, between nature and cultivation. He announces this in the aphorisms, warm and witty, that adorn some of the walls at Inverleith House. 'Superior gardens are composed of Glooms and Solitudes,' says one. 'Certain gardens are described as retreats when they are really attacks,' says another. Or, my favourite: 'Classical gardens deal in grave generalisations, modern gardens in fussy particulars.'  But there is more to this exhibition than mere clever talk. Hamilton Finlay first made his name in the 1960s, producing concrete poetry, an art form in which words and image have a kind of symbiotic relationship. There are good examples of this here: a waterfall of inverted commas that begins with the word 'fountain' and ends with the word 'pen'; or the word 'daisy', repeated in a green chain that is punctuated only by the words, in fierce red: 'Mower is less.'  Still, as Hamilton Finlay would put it: too much chatter sprains the soul. I cannot do justice to this beautifully piercing show on paper. Only by standing in the middle of it will you be able to feel its quietly prayerful effect.  Thanks to the artist's 80th birthday, however, Sentences is not the only display of Hamilton Finlay's work this August; if you have the energy, take yourself out to the Ingleby Gallery in Carlton Terrace for more (the star turn here is an elegantly carved limestone plaque that reads: 'We worship groves and their very silences.') Better still, take advantage of the fact that, until 10 September, coaches are running from the Botanic Garden to the ordinarily inaccessible Little Sparta. In this miniature kingdom - a mettlesome rival to the Athens of the North - is a bird table shaped like an aircraft carrier; a pair of gateposts decorated with what at first look like pineapples, but are in fact hand grenades; and, most deliciously of all, a gravestone in a copse of sycamores that reads: 'Bring back the birch.' In the hands of some, Little Sparta, elliptical and jokey, might have ended up being so much whimsy. Hamilton Finlay, though, has a sage-like quality, not to mention a capacity for hard graft - next year, he will have tended his kingdom for 40 years - that renders it quietly, unsettlingly, profound.  Cai Guo-Qiang, a Chinese artist, opened the Edinburgh Art Festival with Black Rainbow, an arch of fireworks over the castle designed to be seen in daylight. He also has work on display at the Fruitmarket Gallery. So far as I can make out, he is keen on ghosts (one of his installations features a video camera trained on some plantain trees - the idea being that, during the night, a spook may visit since these plants have an affinity with female spirits). Upstairs at the Fruitmarket, is a series of spectral portraits, drawn in gunpowder which was then lit. The effect is lovely and rather Turin Shroud-like.  Even so, it is strange that Guo-Qiang has done portraits of Scottish figures of whom no known likenesses exist. Conan Doyle is one thing, the Lady of Lawers quite another - a situation that is only made more futile by a lack of labels in the gallery. Who or what was Bald Agnes? And which one of these ghoulish outlines is hers? When I visited, the only clue was contained in a folder of photocopied sheets, and this was already in use. Grrr.   00b7 Coach trips to Little Sparta run from the Botanic Garden on Wednesdays and Saturdays until 10 September (0131 248 2983) Summary: Art: Poet, philosopher, sculptor or gardener - Ian Hamilton Finlay defies categorisation, but his work is a balm for frazzled festival-goers, says Rachel Cooke.",

There has been a spate of inversions lately as U.S. corporations seek to use M&A with foreign companies to lower their tax rates by moving their headquarters overseas to friendlier tax locales. Last month, Medtronic MDT announced a $42.9 billion merger with Ireland 2019s Covidien, and much of the deal 2019s rationale had to do with giving the medical device manufacturer an Irish address. Walgreen WAG last week admitted it was considering relocating its home office to Switzerland if it exercises its option to buy the remain 55% of European drugstore chain Alliance Boots that it doesn 2019t already owned, a move that could drastically lower its bill from Uncle Sam.  Destination Maternity, which operates 578 of its own stores in North America along with 1,328 spaces in department stores, disclosed on Wednesday that it has made two non-binding written proposals to buy Mothercare, a struggling UK retailer specializing in items for expectant mothers and general merchandise for children, the latest of which was valued at about $453 million. Both offers were rejected by Mothercare 2019s board, and Destination Maternity in a statement on Wednesday announcing its offers said Mothercare  201chas refused to engage 201d in talks.  Destination Maternity CEO Ed Krell said there is  201ca compelling strategic rationale 201d for combining the two companies. For example, Mothercare could sell Destination Maternity 2019s popular brands in its UK stores, and allow Destination Maternity to use Mothercare 2019s excess retail space.  But for Destination Maternity, one of the biggest advantages of the deal likely has to do with how it would structure the deal: under its most recent overture to Mothercare, made on June 1, the merger would call for the creation of a new UK holding company that would be listed on a U.S. exchange, a move likely to lower its taxes.

            "input": "text:SAN FRANCISCO  2014 The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, an early investor in Boston-based Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. 2019s drugs to treat the chronic lung disease, caught the attention of other patient advocates in November, when it disclosed that it had made $3.3 billon by selling its royalty rights.  Speaking before a small group of venture capitalists and biosciences entrepreneurs here Sunday night, foundation president Robert J. Beall said his group is plowing the proceeds into new disease-fighting alliances with drug makers ranging from Pfizer Inc. to Shire PLC and expanding a Bedford, Mass., lab where scientists use cell lines from cystic fibrosis patients to test compounds that could become medicines.   201cThat 2019s what the monetizing allows us to do, 201d said Beall, who outlined plans to boost employment at the Bedford lab to 20 employees from 13 in the coming months.  201cWe 2019re trying to create collaborations. We think the life expectancy of cystic fibrosis patients can be increased by decades. 201d  The voices of patients and their advocates are growing louder at life sciences industry events like the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, which opened here Monday. While curing and treating patients has always been the focus of the booming business of drug and medical device makers, the patients themselves were conspicuously absent when drug executives in suits and ties gathered in the past.  Now, with the emergence of the  201cventure philanthropy 201d model pioneered by Beall 2019s foundation, and the growing role of patients in lobbying companies, regulators, and lawmakers for more treatment options, patients are becoming a factor to be reckoned with in the biopharmaceutical business.  The backlash from health insurers on expensive prescriptions will be an unavoidable topic at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference.  Like other companies, venture capital firm Polaris Partners of Boston, which hosted a panel of patients, advocates, doctors, and entrepreneurs to talk about patient perspectives as the J.P. Morgan conference got underway, has been seeking out and working with patients who can advise, inspire, and advocate for its portfolio of biotechnology start-ups.   201cWe hope to be able to convert our knowledge of patient needs into benefits for the companies and the patients, 201d said Walter M. Capone, president of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation. Capone said his group has assembled a tissue bank to do genomic analyses and is using the results to help two companies perform clinical trials with experimental drugs.  Critics have suggested the increasing patient role in funding, developing, and marketing drugs raises some concerns and potential conflicts, particularly when venture philanthropy investors profit from higher drug prices that patients must bear. (The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation has said it was not part of Vertex 2019s decision to price its Kalydeco drug at $300,000 a year, though its investment clearly benefited.)  But for many patients and businesses, the benefits of greater patient involvement  2014 and the increased visibility of patients telling their stories  2014 are self-evident.  Martha Rhodes, a former New York advertising executive who suffered from treatment-resistant depression, told the Polaris group she has been able to manage the disease and transform her life through transcranial magnetic stimulation, a technique marketed by Polaris-backed Neuronetics Inc. of Malvern, Pa. Rhodes said she has no financial stake in the company.   201cThis therapy has the potential to save millions of lives of patients who don 2019t respond to traditional drugs, 201d she said.  Another patient advocate, Chris Garcia, a global business consultant based in Los Angeles, told the audience that his acne scar treatment from Polaris-based Suneva Medical Inc. in Santa Barbara, Calif., has been a boost to his career.   201cHaving a clear face with fewer scars played a big role, 201d Garcia said.  201cIt gives you the confidence that 2019s important to success in business. 201d  Polaris venture partner Amy Schulman said the patient perspective is becoming increasingly important in guiding the efforts of investors and entrepreneurs.   201cThe human dimension underlies all our science and all our business, 201d she said.

Lewis Daynes called police on February 17 last year, only hours after cutting the throat of 14-year-old Breck Bednar. The two had met online.  In his call to police, Daynes' voice remains level as he asks for officers and forensic team to be dispatched to his Essex address, saying that he had  an altercation  with a friend, and that only one of them had come out of it alive.  When the operator asks if he is telling them that he's killed somebody, he tells her, in a level voice,  Yes, I am,  before giving them his name and address.  Daynes claimed that Bednar had come to stay the night with him, feeling depressed and suicidal. When he attempted to comfort him the next morning, he said, Bednar had rushed him with a pen knife.   I grabbed the knife and stabbed him in the back of the neck, I believe somewhere near the brain stem,  he says on the call.   I don't remember exactly what happened but the fight ended with me cutting his throat.   But this wasn't the real story. Daynes had lured Bednar to his home after months of online manipulation, and had perpetrated similar patterns of behaviour with other boys.   He used his substantial computer expertise and his knowledge of the world of social media, to control everyone he came into contact with in his virtual world,  lead investigator Detective Inspector Anne Cameron said.   He controlled access to this world jealously and spent a great deal of time building up his online person - pretending to be an entrepreneur in order to influence, coerce and control vulnerable teenage boys to exploit them.   Daynes has shown no remorse whatsoever for his actions. His actions provide a warning to all of us about the dangers of online predators who can come in many forms.   Police found duct tape that Daynes had used to restrain his victim before the killing in a bin bag in his house. Daynes had also submerged his computer in water to destroy evidence of his online life.  Sickeningly, he had sent pictures of Bednar's corpse to two other boys before making the emergency call.  Daynes, who had initially pleaded not guilty, changed his plea on the morning of the trial. He was sentenced yesterday to life in prison.  Do you have any news photos or videos?

The Decacorn Club, with valuations of $10 billion or more, even more so. But the most exclusive one of all?  Just four companies on Fortune 2018s Unicorn List have female CEOs 2014about five percent of the total. A handful more have female co-founders on their leadership teams. Many entrepreneurs and venture capitalists have acknowledged a rise in the number of female-founded startups.  So why aren 2019t more unicorns led by women?  Aileen Lee, the venture capitalist who made the term famous, has some thoughts. She says that the shift in the number of women-led unicorns hasn 2019t been  201cas dramatic as it should be or we want it to be. 201d  Women famously struggle to raise capital. Eighty-five percent of companies that were funded between 2011 and 2013 have no women on their executive teams, according to Babson College researchers. The firm Lee launched in 2012, Cowboy Ventures, is  201copen for business for supporting a more diverse group of founders. 201d She believes female founders (and teams with more diversity) will drive  201cawesome 201d returns.  Until Lee 2019s viewpoint spreads down Sand Hill Road, aspiring female founders have a handful of role models to emulate. Founder-CEOs such as Elizabeth Holmes of blood diagnostics upstart Theranos, Lynn Jurich of solar energy provider SunRun, and Adi Tatarko of home renovation and design platform Houzz have proven that it 2019s very possible for women to build companies that cross the billion-dollar hurdle.  Tatarko, who started Houzz with her husband Alon Cohen in 2009, joined the Unicorn Club after raising $165 million in 2014, but that was never her goal.  201cIt 2019s too difficult to start and run a business for [reaching a billion-dollar valuation] to be your ultimate objective, 201d she says.  201cIt will be very hard to get up in the morning if that 2019s all that drives you. 201d  Bootstrapping in the early days can be invaluable experience, she says.  201cSpend the first six to 12 months building a great product or service that people love, rather than chasing investors, 201d she explains.  201cWhen the time comes to engage investors, you will be meeting them from a position of strength. This makes all the difference. 201d  Eventbrite, the online ticketing service, became a unicorn in March. Co-founder Julia Hartz echoes Tatarko 2019s sentiment. When she started the company with her husband Kevin in 2006, the duo approached more than 20 venture capital firms with their plan and left each meeting empty-handed. Three years later, the Hartzes reapproached VC firms with a list of accomplishments. It was  201ca very different conversation, 201d Hartz says, one that allowed them to choose their backer: Sequoia Capital.  201cOnce you show traction and results, it 2019s much easier to get people to dream about the future with you. 201d  Not everyone can afford to be as patient (or clever) as Tatarko and Hartz. For women looking to raise money now, it 2019s all about the pitch. Lee says women  201ctend to do best when they present themselves as Type-A leaders on the more aggressive, confident side. 201d They should also be very on top of their numbers, concise, and high energy.  201cMale founders who come across as Type B are more likely to get the benefit of the doubt 201d than women with similar personality traits, Lee says. They 2019ll be perceived as  201ccreative geniuses. 201d The same reaction rarely happens with women.  One of the reasons that fake-it-till-you-make-it, Type-A approach may work is because it exudes confidence 2014an elusive trait for some women. Hartz recently spoke as part of a course at Stanford University called  201cEntrepreneurship from the Perspective of a Woman. 201d She says she snuck in early to the all-female class and when the professor asked questions, there was a 20 to 30 second pause before the first hand went up.  201cWithout a guy jumping in, there was silence, 201d Hartz says,  201cWe were all raised in a society where females are getting signals to have a confidence gap. We have to build that muscle. 201d  That confidence starts with a great product or service.  201cFocus on doing something you are truly passionate about, and on building a product or service that people need, want and use, 201d Tatarko says. Hartz says she and her husband 2019s focus has always been on gross ticket sales.  201cWe were talking about a billion in gross ticket sales well before we talked valuation, 201d she says.  201cThat hasn 2019t changed much. 201d Kirsten Green, founder of Forerunner Ventures, says companies that are working to turn services that people are excited about into products also get investors excited.  201cSomewhere along the lines, it becomes a fulfilling prophecy, 201d she says.  201c[Entrepreneurs] justify more money to get more growth. 201d  As the company gains traction, hiring talented people who create more value 2014and more investor interest 2014also help support a sense of self-assurance.  201cThere 2019s no greater lever for excellence than hiring and growing and retaining the best team, 201d Hartz says. Lee says many successful unicorns elevated the quality of their strategy and execution when they hired more experienced executives. Facebook FB , for instance, made key hires such as COO Sheryl Sandberg, former CFO Gideon Yu, and former sales chief Mike Murphy as its growth took off.  201cThere are a lot of benefits to having a team of young people, but there are many benefits to having people who 2019ve made a lot of mistakes, 201d says Lee.  201cMaking those decisions to bring in talent can have huge impact. 201d  The number of female role models in the Unicorn Club will continue to grow, Lee says. Female-founded companies such as Rent the Runway, Minted, One Kings Lane, and Stella & Dot all have the potential to reach billion-dollar valuations in the near future.  Hartz agrees.  201cThere 2019s definitely a shift in the air, 201d she says. In Eventbrite 2019s early days, she was the only female founder in their building in San Francisco 2019s Potrero Hill neighborhood. (It also housed TripIt, Zynga, and Trulia.) Today Hartz knows many more female entrepreneurs.  201cIt 2019s like watching a glacier, 201d she says,  201cbut you have to have patience. The makeup will shift over time. 201d Summary: Billion-dollar startups led by women are rare. The solution? Same as always: Bootstrap, create a great product, be confident, and hire well.",

            "input": "text:Ukraine 2019s President Petro Poroshenko Wednesday fired one of the country 2019s most powerful oligarchs as governor of a key region in central Ukraine, in a power struggle that may become one of the defining moments in the country 2019s post-Soviet history.  Poroshenko said he had  201cgranted a request by Ihor Kolomoysky 201d to be relieved as governor of Dnipropetrovsk, in what appeared to be a face-saving gesture after an explosive row between them over one of the country 2019s most important companies.  The row erupted after Poroshenko passed a new law allowing the state to take back its rights as majority owner of oil refiner Ukrnafta. State officials trying to enter Ukrnafta 2019s offices after the bill passed were blocked by Kolomoysky 2019s armed security guards, leading the president to warn that he wouldn 2019t tolerate any  2018pocket armies 2019.  The bill could redress a number of scandals where state-owned companies have been manipulated by well-connected tycoons over the years. Poroshenko 2019s supporters say it will tame the oligarchs and reduce corruption. Kolomoysky 2019s supporters say it will just be used to benefit other private interests.  Kolomoysky is a uniquely important and highly controversial figure in the fissile politics of Ukraine, being owner of the country 2019s largest bank, Privat, and of an influential TV channel. He lent crucial support first to the Orange Revolution in 2005 and then to Poroshenko in the aftermath of the ousting of Viktor Yanukovych last year.  Poroshenko parachuted him into the governorship of Dnipropetrovsk last year in order to stabilize the situation after Russia annexed Crimea and sponsored revolts by separatists in the country 2019s industrial heartland in the east. He is believed to have bankrolled at least one battalion of militia fighting the separatists and their Russian backers out of his personal fortune.  Facing defeat on the battlefield, and a severe economic crisis, Poroshenko has to strike a balance between keeping the most powerful tycoons loyal, and carrying out the kind of reforms that the International Monetary Fund and others are insisting on in return for bailing it out. Those reforms center on reducing corruption and improving the judicial system 2013two issues that have plagued Ukraine since its independence from the Soviet Union, and which were also the key demands of the protesters who ousted Yanukovych.  Lawmakers such as Mustafa Nayyem, who supported Poroshenko 2019s bill, say it could prove a watershed moment.   201cIn reality, after the dismissal of Ihor Kolomoysky, the president, government and parliament have no option but to declare war on all the remaining oligarchs, 201d Nayyem said in a blog post.  However, he warned that  201cit 2019s clear that the former governor 2019s team isn 2019t prepared to simply surrender, 201d saying that he expected Kolomoysky to undermine Poroshenko and press for new elections.  Any sign of division within Ukraine 2019s ranks may also encourage the Russian-backed rebels to abandon a shaky ceasefire that has held since last month, and launch more opportunistic attacks. Sergey Markov, head of a Kremlin-sponsored working group on international diplomacy, said on his Facebook account Monday that Novorossiya (the Russian term for the separatist regions) must have a plan for the contingency of a sharp weakening of the junta. 201d   201cThis plan has to include rapid attacks by the armies of Novorossiya 201d on territories that have so far stayed loyal to Kyiv, including the port city of Mariupol, Ukraine 2019s second city Kharkiv, and Odessa.  Pro-Russian sentiment in Odessa and Kharkov has tended to be strong in the past, but forces loyal to Kyiv kept the upper hand there last year in violent clashes that, at their worst, saw dozens of pro-Russian demonstrators killed. Kharkov, meanwhile, has been the site of a string of terrorist attacks recently that the authorities say are attempts to destabilize the situation there. Summary: Intense power struggle could mark watershed moment in battle with corruption - or the start of a new phase of political instability for Russia to exploit.",

            "input": "text:While Stephon Marbury has been busy solidifying his status as the Michael Jordan of China, let's take a look at what's been going on back home:  So Steve Nash has retired while sort of employed as a Los Angeles Laker.  But posterity claims have been made in Phoenix, where the mold-shattering playmaker was a two-time league MVP while playing for the Suns.  In the days following his announcement, we've grappled to measure Nash's protean impact on basketball.  Most of the tributes focus on how  2014 while performing in Mike D'Antoni's spread-the-court, pick-and-roll-heavy system  2014 Nash altered game play at all levels. When looking at ball-screen frequency, the staggering jump over the last 10 years would not have occurred without Nash's capacity to read and exploit every permutation.  We're also reminded how Nash was one of the game's greatest marksmen, achieving career 180 status (90 percent on free throws, 50 overall from the field and 42 beyond the 3-point arc) when not using his passing skills to maximize the potential of teammates.  Beyond his off-the-court philanthropic record, perhaps the most important legacy left by Nash was his ability to broaden our perspective on athleticism.  That  athleticism  reference generally has conjured notions of explosive speed and vertical lift. Nash had neither.  But his balance, agility, biomechanically advanced talent to change speed and direction  2014 combined with outrageous, personally-crafted dexterity  2014 became a rallying point for anyone previously disposed to abandon their dreams.  And that's a tremendous footnote to any legacy.  Dwight Howard and Kevin Garnett are two of many who successfully navigated the preps-to-pros jump.  University of Louisville coach Rick Pitino provided a talking point last weekend by opining that players should have the option of going directly from high school to the NBA.  In the crosshairs of Pitino's assertion was the  sham  aspects of the system now referred to as  one and done.   While opponents of the preps-to-pros application claim all sorts of ridiculous fallout from prospects skipping college entirely, please take a look at some numbers.  Since 1995  2014 the year Kevin Garnett's academic issues inspired a leap to the NBA instead of investing a year in junior college  2014 39 prospects have declared for the draft over that 12-year period.  That's hardly an epidemic, and it seems like a grain of sand when compared with the number of high-school youngsters who forego a college education for far riskier pursuits, like in the entertainment field.  Of those 39 on the preps-to-pros roster, 32 can be considered successful; our qualification for this judgment is having played in the NBA for at least eight seasons. Although these players have experienced varying degrees of success, 10 of the 32 have been All-Stars. That's a pretty strong ratio.  In terms of on-court development, college coaches are limited by the NCAA in time allotted to help build skills. And since when has being on a college campus accelerated the off-court maturity process?  Admittedly, this space recently provided an update on Karl-Anthony Towns, the Kentucky freshman post player whose steady rise has inspired some NBA draft watchers  2014 and league personnel guys  2014 to rate him as a superior prospect to Duke's Jahlil Okafor.  Grant Halverson-Getty Images North America  One NBA scout calls Jahlil Okafor one of the best low-post prospects in years.  Well, we understand the reasons for such a long-term projection  2014 Towns is a more versatile, committed defender and (for now) looks more comfortable turning, facing and sticking a jump shot.  But in terms of being an offensive threat on the post, he's not even close to Okafor.  For validation or condemnation, we contacted four NBA personnel sharpies and solicited their opinions.  Three were in agreement, while the fourth thought the difference in post play wasn't all that significant.   As far as footwork overall and balance in general, recognition, hands and finishing skill, Okafor isn't just far ahead of Towns right now,  one of our experts said.  He's one of the best low-post scoring prospects we've seen in years ... but the other guy's gonna be a pretty dang good basketball player, too.   In addition to the draft class of 2013, it's just nice to be witnessing the seeming rise of skilled players willing to work close to the basket.  Now that his Florida Gators have slogged through a rare losing season, Coach Billy Donovan finds his name among candidates to fill whatever NBA vacancies currently or will exist.  Florida's Billy Donovan turned the NBA down once, but he's back in the crosshairs of teams looking for a coach.  Donovan, who has coached Florida to back-to-back NCAA championships, flirted with coaching professionals when he agreed to join the Orlando Magic in 2007.  Even though he walked away from that opportunity, it reportedly could be presented to him eight years later.  And with Oklahoma City Thunder coach Scott Brooks riding the hot seat for a while, that potential opening also has been listed as possibility.  Iowa State coach Fred Hoiberg has also once again been tagged for NBA consideration, with rumors of Tom Thibodeau's rift with the Chicago Bulls inspiring Hoiberg's name to reach the top in connection with his former team.  On the playing front, one name inspiring considerable chatter is restricted-free-agent-to-be Khris Middleton, who is averaging 19 points per game in March for the Milwaukee Bucks. Unfortunately, Middleton hasn't prevented the Bucks from losing all but 4 of 17 games  2014 including six in a row through Sunday  2014 since trading away Brandon Knight.  Despite their young talent on the wings, however, don't expect the Bucks to allow Middleton to walk away.  This week's most-compelling matchup actually brings two disparate basketball styles to Memphis on Friday night.  Friday brings us a stylistic Western Conference showdown between the frenetic Warriors and the grinding Grizzlies.  In the Grizzlies and the Golden State Warriors, we also have two polar opposites who happen to be atop the Western Conference standings.  As for those stylistic notions, Golden State is No. 1 in pace among NBA teams; Memphis rolls in at 26th. Based quite a bit on this difference in tempo, the Warriors lead the league in fast-break points, while the Grizzlies are 20th.  The Warriors are fifth in frequency of 3-point attempts; the Grizzlies are 29th.  Golden State  2014 expecting a return from injury for deadeye Klay Thompson  2014 is fourth in the league for percentage of points delivered via the 3-point shot. The Grizzlies, who prefer grinding with Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol, are 29th ... and first for percentage of points from inside the arc.  Will this be a prelude to the conference finals?

Such an outcome  2014 a decision by the Greek government not to pay its creditors  2014 has generally been seen as remote, even since the left-wing Syriza government came to power in January.  But now, after months of bitter, inconclusive negotiations over the austerity measures Greece would have to impose in order to secure desperately needed cash from Europe, government officials are grappling with very limited options for handling their cash squeeze.  On April 9, Greece must pay 458 million euros ($503 million) to the International Monetary Fund, a date and sum that in recent weeks have come to loom large for investors, many of whom worry how the markets would absorb a messy Greek default.  Adding to these concerns was the abrupt decision by Greece 2019s finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, to fly to Washington and meet with the IMF 2019s managing director, Christine Lagarde, on Sunday.  In a statement, the IMF said Lagarde and Varoufakis were having an  201cinformal discussion on the Greek government 2019s reform program. 201d  Greece has said it has the money to pay the IMF this week. Moreover, Varoufakis, from the moment he became finance minister, has gone out of his way to cultivate ties with Lagarde and has said that paying the fund was a priority for Greece.  Over the past month, however, the economic situation in Greece has worsened drastically. Deposits worth about 25 billion euros have been withdrawn from Greek banks, some of which are now on life support with help from the European Central Bank.  The government 2019s tax collections are also suffering as companies and consumers fret over the prospect that Greece might be forced to abandon the euro.  With Europe refusing to permit Greece access to temporary lines of liquidity  2014 such as letting its banks issue more short-term treasury notes  2014 Greece is running out of cash. That means if it were to pay the fund 458 million euros Thursday, there might not be enough to pay pensions and public sector wages the next week, some Greek officials say.  Varoufakis, whose party came to power on a platform of ending the policy of putting the needs of Greece 2019s creditors above its suffering citizens, was to make the case to Lagarde that his government would not be able to meet all of its commitments.  There is some wiggle room. Even if Greece does not pay up on Thursday, it will not be in technical default, as there is a 30-day grace period that could allow the government to pay its pension and wage obligations and strike a broader deal so that its creditors could disburse the needed funds.  Varoufakis is also planning to meet with US Treasury officials Monday in the hope that the United States, as the dominant voice at the IMF, might pressure fund officials, and Europe as well, to cut Greece some slack.  The United States has been quietly critical of Europe 2019s harsh stance toward Greece, warning of the consequences that a Greek default and exit from the euro would have on financial markets.  All told, Greece owes 320 billion euros, with close to 20 billion euros in payments coming due in the next six months.

Alongside several of their costars  2014 Chris Carmack (closeted singer Will Lexington), Aubrey Peeples (Lexington 2019s former beard, Layla Grant), and Lennon & Maisy Stella (the dynamic sister act who play Rayna Jaymes 2019s harmonizing daughters)  2014 Bowen and Esten hit the stage at a sold-out Citi Wang Theatre on Saturday for  201cABC 2019s  2018Nashville 2019 in Concert 201d tour.   201cWe 2019re lucky, 201d says Esten on the phone from Music City.  201cThere 2019s a whole lot of shows that don 2019t get to go out and party with their fan bases. And that 2019s what we get to do with these diehard fans that love these characters and stories and songs. 201d  While both actors have plenty of experience making music on the stage and screen  2014 among other credits, Esten had a long-running stint playing Buddy Holly in the West End at the start of his career, while Bowen appeared in  201cSpring Awakening 201d in her native Australia  2014 it 2019s no coincidence that they play singer-songwriters on the nighttime soap about the lives and loves of country musicians. They have long written and sung personally, and, thanks to the launching pad that  201cNashville 201d has provided  2014 scoring them slots at last weekend 2019s Stagecoach festival and opening gigs for artists like Alan Jackson and Dierks Bentley  2014 both hope to release albums of their original material soon.   201cIt 2019s nearly done, 201d says Bowen, also on the phone from Nashville  2014 the real one  2014 of the record that she worked on with former show consultant T Bone Burnett and members of the Nashville songwriting community.  201cIt snuck up on me. The show brought me here so I have to devote most of my time to that, so all of my writing and collaborating and performing my own stuff is in between. I was just plugging away at it and had a look at everything, and it 2019s suddenly nearly there. I 2019ve got to put it all together. It 2019s real now, it 2019s pretty cool. 201d   201cI 2019m always working on it, inasmuch as I 2019m always writing, 201d says Esten of his potential release, for which he also tapped the rich local songwriter scene.  201cBut this summer, I 2019m going to focus down and get something out there. The great thing is even on this tour itself, we 2019re going to be playing some of our own songs. So that 2019s a lot of fun for us, and hopefully for the audiences as well. 201d  Charles Esten during the 2015 Stagecoach, California's Country Music Festival.  On how her songwriting voice might differ from her character 2019s, Bowen says with a laugh,  201cI 2019m a bit louder than Scarlett. She 2019s been allowed to let loose a bit over the past season which has been really nice. I don 2019t really know what kind of artist I am or what kind of music I make. I think I 2019ll just let other people decide. 201d  Esten says it can be difficult distinguishing between his voice and Deacon 2019s.  201cI don 2019t know if this sounds corny or not, but we share a heart in a way, 201d he says.  201cThat 2019s even true with the acting. That line is very blurred if you 2019re doing it right. Certainly you have to have all the things that bring the character with it, but if you try to step too far away from your own heart and your own sensibilities that move you, it 2019s not going to resonate in the same way. 201d  Esten, Bowen, and their castmates will bring the whole kit and caboodle to the Wang stage  2014 original songs, those they 2019ve performed on the show, and covers  2014 in performances that will range from solo stints to duets, small groups, and likely an all-hands-on-deck finale.  Hopeful that the fans will enjoy it all, Bowen is heartened by an experience singing  201cBlack Roses 201d in Chicago on a similar tour last year. Mid-song, she thought that she had an interference problem with her in-ear monitors, and feared that she was singing off-key.   201cI realized that it was the crowd singing along to the song  2014 that was the interference, 201d she says, laughing.  201cIt was really scary, but also wonderful, going from being terrified to this amazing realization that all these people knew the words. And it was the first time it had ever happened to me, it was lovely. 201d (Given that her TV character had an onstage meltdown in the same city was a nice bit of symmetry.)  As the actors embark on the tour, they 2019re waiting to learn whether  201cNashville 201d will be picked up for a fourth season, which will be announced on or before May 12. While both are cautiously optimistic, Esten admits to nerves.   201cI won 2019t say I 2019m a jaded actor, 201d says Esten.  201cBut I 2019ve been around almost 25 years, and I 2019ve seen things come and go. And I didn 2019t get taken on that ride, ever, because I knew if it was meant to be, it was meant to be. But this is not that  2014 I don 2019t want to do anything other than continue to see what happens in the life of Deacon. 201d Summary:  201cNashville 201d stars Clare Bowen and Charles Esten are part of a live concert featuring stars from the ABC-TV series, which comes to the Citi Wang Theatre on Saturday.",

Paul Dawson, linebacker  2014 Cincinnati Bengals Summary: For starters, they used their second-round pick on a safety, a seemingly well-stocked position.  Next, despite ranking 25th in points scored en route to an 8-8 record last year, they continued to ignore their offense and took an outside linebacker in the third round.  The surprises started when the 49ers used a second-round pick on big-hitting Samford safety Jaquiski Tartt, a two-time finalist for the Buck Buchanan Award, given to the top defensive player in FCS.  Tartt said he expected to be a third- or fourth-round pick, but many analysts had him pegged in the second round based on his blend of size (6-foot-1, 218) and speed (4.55-second 40-yard dash).  Last year, they signed Antoine Bethea, a three-time Pro Bowler, and made cornerback safety Jimmie Ward their first-round pick.  Tartt, who is best friends with Ward, his teammate at Davidson  High in Mobile, Ala., thought the 49ers wouldn 2019t be interested given their safety situation.  Reid, however, has had three concussions in his two-year career, Bethea will turn 31 in July and Ward 2019s rookie season ended prematurely after he re-broke his foot, an injury he initially sustained in his final year in college.  [...] we 2019re confident in both of those guys being able to stay healthy and play football for us.  2026  The 49ers, who selected Oregon defensive end Arik Armstead in the first round Thursday, followed by grabbing Virginia outside linebacker Eli Harold in the third round.  In his final two seasons, Harold, a defensive end in college, collected 105 tackles, 29.5 tackles for loss and 15.5 sacks.  Harold joins an outside linebacker corps headlined by Aldon Smith, Ahmad Brooks and Aaron Lynch, a 2014 fifth-round pick who had a team-high six sacks as a rookie.  Baalke insisted they wouldn 2019t stray from their draft board, even if it resulted in a glut of defensive players.  [...] round:  [...] round:  [...] round  Two-time finalist for award given to best defensive player in FCS.  2026  Sixth Samford player selected in NFL draft (first taken in the first four rounds).  2026  Was a first-team FCS All-American in 2014 when he had 62 tackles and one INT.  In his draft guide, analyst Nolan Nawrocki said: Big, strong, fast, physical FCS impact performer with a skill set that translates to the NFL.  [...] round  Ranks 10th in school history in tackles for losses (36.5) and 11th in sacks (17.5).  2026",

            "input": "text:NEW YORK 2014 The first year of the Reagan era dawns bleakly, as the economic problems that helped Mr. Reagan gain the Presidency become his to solve.  The list is a formidable one, including double-digit inflation, double-digit interest rates, lagging savings and investment, sluggish productivity growth, chronic unemployment and a loss by some American industries, such as autos and steel, of the ability to compete in world markets.  The national mood is combative; conflicts have intensified among groups over shares of a real national income that has been stagnating.  These problems add up to a complex economic disorder known, for want of a better term, as stagflation. Mr. Reagan's campaign for the Presidency was based chiefly on his commitment to break the hold of stagflation on the American economy.  As an unconventional conservative, Mr. Reagan sees the challenge facing him as comparable to that which confronted the liberal Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933. This year will mark the start of an experiment to resolve a national economic crisis that is comparable to the program begun by the New Deal nearly half a century ago.  Now, as then, a new President senses that the nation is plagued by anxiety over its economic future and knows that a key part of the job of reconstruction will be psychological. Mr. Roosevelt's unforgettable rallying cry was, ''We have nothing to fear but fear itself,'' and Mr. Reagan has not hesitated to quote him.  But the real test will be whether Mr. Reagan can develop effective and coherent programs to break up a very different crisis from that which afflicted the United States and world economy during the Great Depression.  The present situation is not as grim and urgent as the one which Mr. Roosevelt sought to resolve almost 50 years ago, when one-fourth of the labor force was jobless. But, for the longer run, stagflation threatens to erode America's economic strength as seriously as did depression in the 1930's.  Stagflation is in many ways a more baffling problem than depression. The Depression posed an irresistible imperative to the New Deal, which was simply to get the nation back to work no matter how much conventional economists warned about future inflation, government interference in the price system and threats to the traditional capitalist order.  Although Mr. Roosevelt had campaigned on a platform of balancing the budget, his remedies for unemployment produced deeply unbalanced budgets. Fortuitously, these proved to be reasonably effective medicine against mass unemployment caused by an insufficiency of demand for what the economy was capable of producing. Indeed, the demand-increasing policies of the New Deal were validated in 1936, when John Maynard Keynes published his ''General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money.''  Mr. Reagan's problem is more complex than was Mr. Roosevelt's, since chronic inflation - partly a consequence of the Keynesian revolution - is combined with the problems of unemployment and slow or no growth.  The new Republican President sounds like his Democratic predecessors, Roosevelt and Kennedy, when he declares, ''We're going to put America back to work again.'' But he must achieve this objective in a way that will not worsen the now deeply ingrained inflation and inflationary expectations.  Mr. Reagan's fundamental stress has been on economic expansion as the answer to inflation. During the campaign, he accepted the ''supply side'' argument that tax cuts would prove counterinflationary by raising incentives, productivity and output and that, by generating additional tax revenues, the budget gap would be closed over time.  But his traditional conservative economic advisers have warned him against going too far with that line, lest excessive fiscal stimulus worsen inflation and sap the gains he is seeking. Still, Mr. Reagan refuses to scrap his proposals for big tax cuts, and he and his aides have continued to put heavy stress on increasing military expenditures.  Thus, his effort to effect a compromise between supply-siders and traditionalists has taken the form of proposals for deep cuts in nondefense expenditures, not including Social Security. However, there appears to be so little scope for cuts in the rest of the budget -and Congress, under the pressure of interest groups, seems unlikely to give him all the cuts he wants - that the compromise appears to have fallen on the inflationary side, promising to make fiscal policy highly stimulative in the coming years. And a heavy reliance on monetary policy to check inflation will only result in higher interest rates and possibly credit crunches.  As a result of forces already at work, the prospect is for sluggish growth in 1981, and possibly a resumption of the recession that marked the first half of 1980. The McGraw-Hill survey finds United States businesses planning to increase their capital outlays by 11.9 percent in 1981. But since business also expects plant and equipment prices to go up by 10.1 percent, the real gain in capital outlays would amount to only 1.8 percent. Rising mortgage interest rates are also putting additional strains on the recovery of housing, although the promised rise in defense spending will help buoy other sectors.  With real gross national product growing by no more than 1 percent in 1981, the unemployment rate, which averaged 7.3 percent in 1980, is likely to rise above 8 percent and stay there through most of 1981.  The economic slowdown, both in this country and abroad, is likely to keep inflation from worsening significantly during the coming year, although rising food and oil prices in world markets are likely to prevent much improvement in the inflation rate, which is expected to continue at around 10 percent.  If a breakout from the pattern of stagflation that has dogged the American economy for nearly a decade is about to happen this year, it will come as a surprise not only to most economists and businessmen but also to the Reagan administration. Talking to reporters after the election, Mr. Reagan said, quoting Abraham Lincoln: ''Well, boys, your troubles are over now; mine have just begun.''  But his hope is that the new conservative medicine of tax and spending cuts, defense increases and deregulation will gradually cure stagflation and get rid of it by the end of his four-year term.

            "input": "text:WASHINGTON, July 20 2014 A running dispute between the Agriculture Secretary and the Secretary of State over who would negotiate with the Soviet Union on a new grain trading pact has been settled, and an invitation for new talks has been sent to Moscow, an Agriculture Department official said today.  In a compromise solution, the State Department announced that Bill Brock, the United States trade representative, would head the American negotiating team.  A State Department spokesman said that no date or place had been set as yet. But it was understood that a message suggesting further talks was sent by the State Department this morning.  During the 12 weeks since President Reagan ended the curtailment on grain sales to the Soviet Union, Agriculture Secretary John R. Block has been pushing for a new bilateral grain trade agreement with the Russians.  But Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. opposed any quick move to the bargaining table and had insisted that the State Department negotiators, rather than those from the Agriculture Department, should head the American team at any new talks with the Russians. 1980 Trade Bill  ''He even talked about leading the negotiations himself,'' said an Agriculture Department official who did not want to be identified.  A compromise was reached by the White House over the weekend, and Mr. Brock was picked to lead the American side when, and if, the talks are resumed. The trade representative was supposed to do this under terms of a clause in a 1980 trade bill designating him as the President's chief negotiator for trade, including agriculture and commodity matters.  ''The Agriculture Secretary was quite pleased with Mr. Brock's selection,'' the Agriculture Department official said. ''He did not think Mr. Haig should fill that role in farm commodity talks.''  Earlier this month, on the assumption that a message had gone to the Russians suggesting a new round of talks, Mr. Block said he expected Agriculture Department representatives to meet with Soviet grain officials late in July. But he apparently was not aware, at that time, that the invitation had not been sent.  In commenting on this today, a State Department spokesman said: ''The State Department does not hold up outgoing messages once interagency agreement has been reached.''  Mr. Block said yesterday during a CBS television appearance that he still believed Moscow wanted a new trade agreement to replace the five-year pact that expires Oct. 1.  ''Right now the Administration is in agreement that we'll move forward with talks and discussions providing the Soviets would like to do this,'' he said. No New Russians Orders  Last month, during preliminary talks in London, the United States offered to sell to the Soviet Union an additional six million tons of wheat and corn from the 1980 crop. But so far the Russians have placed no order for this grain.  During the curtailment imposed by President Carter the Soviet Union found other sources for corn and wheat and succeeded in replacing the 17 million metric tons of wheat and corn that the President had blocked. Last week the Canadians announced the Russians were buying additional quantities of wheat from them. Earlier last month the Soviet Union announced it would continue to give priority to Argentina as a supplier of grain. This heightened the fears of American farmers that the United States had lost a major share of the Russian market.  Under terms of the current bilateral grain pact, the Russians had agreed to buy between six and eight metric tons of American wheat and feed grains annually. They had bought and received shipment of the final eight million tons earlier this year, before President Reagan ended the curtailment of further sales to them.  Mr. Block has also supported a proposal to provide Poland with $80 million in emergency food aid. The Polish Government had asked for this, Mr. Block said, to buy 400,000 tons of grain to sustain poultry production.  But before deciding on this request, the Administration was waiting to see what direction Poland would take following last week's special Communist Party congress in Warsaw, an Agriculture Department official said today.

Gray Jr., president and general counsel, Western Connecticut Industrial Council Inc.; Leon L. LeMaire, president of the Connecticut Small Business Federation and William H. Taft Jr., president of the Manufacturers Association. William B. Kennedy, vice president and professor of political science at Sacred Heart University in Bridgeport, will lead the discussion.  According to Mr. Taft, the most pressing concern is increases in unemployment compensation, which he said will cost employers $70 million over the next three years.  Benefits will rise from a current top of $146 a week to $180 and the waiting week has been deleted. Another item under contention is the establishment of offices to aid employees in filing workers' compensation claims. ''Employers will have to finance the service through a surtax on workers' compensation premiums,'' said Mr. Taft.  In a third legislated mandate, he said that employers must conduct training programs in the management of any of 400 toxic substances that may be used in their businesses.  Admission to the symposium is free. For more details, call 371-7751. A SHIP'S BIRTHDAY  The world's smallest square-rigger, the Joseph Conrad, is celebrating its 100th birthday at Mystic Seaport. Built in 1882 by the Burmeister and Wain Shipyard in Copenhagen, the Joseph Conrad was a training ship for 6,000 cadets of the Danish merchant service until 1934. For the following two years, the ship was taken on a 58,000 mile around-the-world cruise with a group of British cadets, setting sail from Harwich, England and landing in New York in 1936.  After serving for a time as a private yacht, the ship was given to the United States Government as a training ship. It was turned over to the Mystic Seaport in 1947, where it has been berthed every since as an educational and exhibition vessel.  From 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. Saturday and Sunday, visitors may stroll the teakwood decks, lend a hand at hoisting sail or raising the anchor and join in a chantey. Films made during the ship's world voyage, maritime demonstrations and an exhibition of the ship's history will be displayed. The public may also watch the construction of a 15-foot longboat similar to the original and made from plans supplied by a Danish museum.  Available for purchase will be scale models of the Joseph Conrad and kits for building them, T-shirts and commemorative items. To reach the Seaport take Exit 76 off the Connecticut Turnpike, go east on Route 95 to Exit 90. Admission is $8, children $4. For more details, call 1-800-243-1685. TRIP TO THE ISLANDS  Beginning next Sunday, the Saugatuck Valley Audubon Society will run weekend trips to the Norwalk Islands on its trimaran, The Conservator. The flat-decked boat holds 18 people in addition to the crew. Led by Audubon specialists, the participants will explore marine life, shore birds, wildflowers and the remains of previous habitation on foot and from the awning-covered boat, whose shallow draft permits it to travel close to the shoreline.  Each trip covers two or three of some 20 islands located between one and three miles off the Norwalk-Westport shore and ranging in size from one to 30 acres. The trips take six hours and do not run in inclement weather. A special $12 membership in the Audubon Society includes one trip, additional trips cost $5. Children through high school are charged half fare and a second child may travel free.  Special arrangements may be made for groups such as bird clubs, biology classes, photography clubs and scout troops. Lunches should be brought by participants. To make reservations or obtain more information, call 866-7830 or 866-8303. FLORAL COPYCATS  Flowers depicted in watercolors, oils, drawings and prints from the 17th to the 20th centuries will be rivalled by fresh flower arrangements in a springtime show at the New Canaan Library. Each week until June 5 two paintings will serve as models for two fresh floral arrangements prepared by members of the Garden Center of New Canaan, the New Canaan Garden Club or the New Canaan Men's Garden Club. The pictures are on loan from the Hunt Institute and Carnegie-Mellon University.  This week Patricia Vandewarker, president of the New Canaan Garden Club, will emulate a French 19th-century, color stipple engraving by Antoine Chazal. Leslie Greenwood's contemporary English watercolor will be interpreted by Mrs. William Pike and Mrs. William Crawford of the Garden Center.  For more information, call 966-1985.

            "input": "text:The list of women accusing  of sexual assault grew Thursday, with two new women publicly coming forward in New York City with their stories.  The two accusers join a group of more than  who allege they were drugged and sexually assaulted by the comedian.  Charlotte Fox and  Elizabeth   2013 who asked that her real name not be used  2013 detailed their allegations against the 78-year-old comedian in a press conference held by civil rights attorney Gloria Allred, who is representing the alleged victims. The women were also joined in support by another alleged Cosby victim, Sarita Butterfield, who came forward with her story last November.  Elizabeth claimed she was barely 20 years old when she met Cosby while working as a flight attendant in the summer of 1976. Cosby allegedly invited her to the Playboy Mansion, but she declined. She said that a persistent Cosby later called her hotel and invited her once again. After an afternoon at the mansion, Elizabeth accepted the comedian's invitation to dinner since, she said,  Mr. Cosby had been a gentleman.   The two allegedly dined at Tokyo KaiKan, where Elizabeth revealed she did not drink or use drugs. Cosby, she claimed, insisted she drink sake to  loosen  her up. After drinking the sake, Elizabeth recalled feeling light-headed.   I was completely in a trancelike state, like I was dreaming,  she read in a statement.  I don't remember how we got to his hotel room. He went to the bathroom and undressed and came out in a robe.   Because of how sick she felt, Elizabeth said she could barely stand up.  He made me kneel down,  she read from her statement before breaking down in tears.  All I know is that it was the most horrifying thing that could happen to an innocent woman.   Attorney Gloria Allred (center) is joined by a woman who identified herself as Elizabeth (left) and Charlotte Fox (right)  The second alleged victim, Charlotte Fox, said she was 23 years old when she met Cosby while working as an extra on the set of  in '70s. One day, the comedian invited Fox and a few others to a late-night jam session at a local jazz club. After dinner and drinks, Cosby purportedly invited the group to continue the night at the Playboy Mansion, where she allegedly fell ill after eating and drinking some more at the mansion.   I vaguely remember coming back from the bathroom,  Fox read in a statement.  The next thing I remember was that I was sort of awake, in a bed, with no clothes on and there was Mr. Cosby, in a robe, crawling from the bottom of the bed.   Fox added,  I was incapacitated and couldn't say no. He engaged in sexual activity with me. It was not consensual.   The two women's stories resemble those of the more than  actor of sexual assault. The comedian has repeatedly denied the allegations, but in a recently released 2005 deposition, admitted to having given a woman Quaaludes before having sex with her. The actor's attorney Marty Singer did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but has previously said that the claims  about alleged decades-old events are becoming increasingly ridiculous.   Cosby is scheduled to give his testimony on Oct. 9, after a  the actor to give a deposition in the civil suit filed by Allred's client Judy Huth  2013 who claims the comedian molested her at the Playboy Mansion when she was 15 years old.   We expect to take the deposition of Bill Cosby, not the friendly father figure of his television character, Dr. Huxtable,  Allred said at the press conference.  We want the real Bill Cosby to show up, not Dr. Huxtable and we expect Mr. Cosby will answer our questions fully and completely.   The Oct. 9 deposition will mark the first time Cosby has spoken about a sexual-assault allegation against him since a separate case in 2005.

She couldn't stop staring at the photo on  special-needs adoption website. She just knew, without question, that the boy was meant to be her son.   I couldn't pull my eyes away  2013 there was something special about him,  Devon,40, tells PEOPLE, relaxing at the sunny kitchen table in her Eagle, Idaho, home as her three boys wrestle and laugh on the carpet nearby.  I'd always felt that when the time was right, a child in need would find us. And here he was, waiting for us, thousands of miles away.   It's lunchtime on a lazy Sunday  2013 more than five years since Devon, her husband, Jeremy,38, and their two sons, Heath,9, and Brooks,6, flew to Serbia to adopt Bowen, then 18 months old, and place him at the heart of their family.  Devon has prepared 6-year-old Bowen's favorite steel-cut oatmeal, topped with bananas  2013 a treat that he would eat three times a day if she would allow it.   Thanks, Mom!  he says, rolling across the floor and then pulling himself up to his full height of 25 inches and hopping up to a bench at the table. He slides a Velcro cuff with a spoon onto his left upper arm  2013 the only limb he has ever known.  Can I have a chocolate muffin, too?   Happy and talkative, Bowen's radiant demeanor doesn't reveal a hint of his dreary past. Abandoned after birth, he spent the early months of his life in a crowded orphanage in Belgrade, seldom leaving his crib, never interacting with other children and rarely being spoken to by caregivers.   When we first saw him in his crib at the orphanage, it was very emotional,  Jeremy, an orthopedic surgeon, tells PEOPLE.  When Devon first told me about Bowen, I was shocked, thinking that we should wait a few years to adopt. But then I realized that there was no perfect time. Here was a little guy who needed a family.   When the Toomeys brought Bowen home in June 2010, they immediately realized that his missing limbs weren't the main challenge.   The biggest issue was speech,  says Devon,  because nobody had been talking to him. He also didn't know how to chew food, because he'd been on a liquid diet. And because he was stuck in a crib, he didn't know how to move.   Early on, a doctor told Devon that her son would never be able to sit up on his own or move across a room.   I immediately walked out of his office,  she says.  I knew he was wrong.   She and Jeremy were also told by several friends and family members that adopting Bowen would be a burden,  like a sack of potatoes.    They didn't see what we saw,  says Devon,  and that was painful. I'd always believed he could do whatever he put his mind to.   Encouraged by his parents and brothers, Bowen did just that. At first, he did barrel rolls to get around the house. Then, as he gained strength, he learned to scoot on his behind, propelled by his left elbow. Now in the first grade, he has a set of prosthetic limbs that he calls his  Spiderman legs,  but he doesn't like to use them except for skiing.   He's figured out the best way to do things on his own,  says Jeremy.  It's been wonderful to see his independence grow.   A quick learner, Bowen loves to read at home and play games on his iPad, and he enjoys swimming, painting, drawing and roughhousing with his older brothers.   He's not weird  2013 he can do the same stuff that I can,  says Heath.  We shouldn't judge people by what they look like. We should judge them by their heart. Judge them by their insides, not their outsides.    My brother is amazing,  adds Brooks, who is the same age as Bowen.  He jumps on a trampoline and he can use a spoon or can dip his head into the plate and eat anything that's on there.   Bowen laughs at his brothers and hops down from the table to chase after them. As his parents watch the boys wrestle, tears fill their eyes.   Through trial and error, he's come a long way,  says Jeremy.  We're so very grateful to have him in our lives.

            "input": "text: It's both supply and demand. it's basically the perfect storm that brought oil prices down,  said Fadel Gheit, Oppenheimer senior energy analyst.  You have plenty of supply which you never thought possible, and all of a sudden, demand is shrinking, China's slowing down, Europe never recovered.   He said the fact that the Saudis are willing to play hardball with prices makes it difficult for other oil-based economies like Russia.  Saudi Aramco, the state-run oil company, surprised markets Wednesday when it announced it would cut official prices for Asian customers in November. The cuts come as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was expected to be on course to cut back on production instead, to protect prices.  Read MoreCheap oil 'a mirage' and heading to $140: Dicker  Analysts say that Saudi Arabia, by instead cutting prices to defend market share, is reinforcing its role as the world's swing producer, capable of controlling the flow 2014and prices 2014better than any other single producer.   It will not be a full-fledged price war,  Gheit said.  There are always skirmishes but not a full-fledged war because OPEC really is held together by Scotch Tape,  he said, adding that the organization is  incompetent  and members are  jealous  of each other.  They hate each other. At the end of the day, I think they are paying the price. They never really pay attention to any alternative for their own (oil) revenues.   He said Saudi Arabia could afford to produce at lower levels despite assumptions that it needs $100 a barrel to meet its required budget revenues.  But Commerzbank analysts said   OPEC appears to be gearing up for a price war.   In a note, they said Saudi prices are getting close to levels of the 2008-09 economic crisis.  Such measures give rise to doubts about OPEC's longstanding strategy of striving above all for price stability,  they wrote.  We therefore do not expect prices to stabilize until this impression disappears and OPEC returns to coordinated production cuts.   Analyst John Kilduff of Again Capital said recent surveys show OPEC production at about 31 million barrels a day, and while the organization signaled it may cut production at its November meeting, an OPEC response would be needed to change the course for prices.   I think we're going to see the low $80s fairly quickly from here if there's no supply response from OPEC,  Kilduff said.  Peak winter demand season is upon us, and it could bail them out. Brent will likely head to the low $80s. If the winter cooperates even slightly I would look for the price action to bottom around January.    The Saudis did cut production by about 400,0, which is token,  he said.  Gene McGillian, analyst with Tradition Energy, said the next likely target for WTI is $85 a barrel, and then it's uncertain how much lower it will go. For Brent, it would be $90 a barrel.  Are these fears of slowing conditions and ample supplies going to continue to really depress the price, where we're going to have action taken on the supply side to get some supply price stability?  McGillian asked.  The U.S. reported that domestic oil production was at 8.8 million barrels a day last week, a near three-decade high. The growth in U.S. output has resulted in a displacement of African crude that had once gone to U.S. refineries and now goes to Asia.  McGillian said more speculative shorts have been moving into Brent in recent weeks.  That's one reason the spreads have come under pressure and Brent is so weak. At some point, the slide is overdone, and up until yesterday, there was a question of whether it's done. It's not done. It's still searching for a new level,  he said. Summary: Oil could continue its deep slide, under new pressure from Saudi Arabia's decision to cut its selling price rather than cut production.",

The worst supply chain in our society is the health information supply chain,  said Jonathan Bush, head of Athenahealth.  It's just a wonderfully poignant example, reminder of how disconnected our health-care system is.    It's just a very Stone-Age sector, because it's very conservative,  Bush said.

Just days later, he returned to the hospital, where he eventually tested positive for the Ebola virus.  On Thursday, the hospital released a statement that essentially pointed a finger at a flaw in its electronic records system, but the hospital has since recanted that statement, saying  the patient's travel history was documented and available to the full care team in the electronic health record (EHR), including within the physician's workflow.   Even so, medical IT experts say many hospital systems need to be improved.  In an interview with CNBC conducted prior to the hospital's reversal, Bush cautioned that he is not blaming either Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, nor its electronic health software vendor Epic Systems, for the breakdown in communication.  Read MoreTexas hospital with Ebola patient probed  Instead, he said, there is a problem among U.S. medical providers overall of relying on electronic health record systems that tend to be customized for individual providers, and not networked together nationally so that they can be updated in response to situations like the current Ebola epidemic in parts of West Africa.   The hyperbole should not be directed at Epic or those guys at Health Texas,  Bush said.  The hyperbole has to be directed at the fact that health care is islands of information trying to separately manage a massively complex network.

His work is so diverse that critics are sometimes reduced to listing his past achievements in the hope it will shed some light on their creator. This is a shame, because Liversidge is an offbeat talent of a very British kind. Humour is the key to his art, a particularly surreal form of pedantry that is reminiscent of the comic genius Spike Milligan.  His most accessible pieces are the clunky cardboard replicas of luxury goods that he's been making for the past few years. Liversidge creates counterfeits, from Cartier watches to digital cameras, that wouldn't deceive a five-year-old. Often he chooses items that have some kind of mechanical element  2013 such as a pair of binoculars or a video camera  2013 or are themselves the mechanism, like batteries, a roll of film or a credit card. These objects may be useless and his rendering of them less than adequate, but this is, in part, a cunning game: they fetch a higher price as artworks than the originals ever will.  Of course this is a classic pop art strategy, as old as Warhol, yet Liversidge reinvigorates it by exploiting our affection for nostalgia, offering escapism from the realities of the everyday. His artworks are flights of the imagination; he wants us to question what is possible.  Which brings us to Liversidge's ongoing Proposal series, which has evolved over the past 10 years from scrappy ideas on a page of foolscap to a series of books featuring hundreds of ideas. All are delightfully impractical, from freezing over the Mersey to wrapping a halo of lights around Arthur's Seat, and some are absurdly reductive, such as a project to fill one of Liversidge's own exhibitions with smoke so that the art is concealed behind a thick white mist. What we are left with is very little: merely an opening to the realms of possibility.

With major players like ConocoPhillips COP and Marathon mro splitting up, industry leaders and the market are starting to question the model of the huge, integrated oil company that handles every portion of the business, from plumbing crude out of the ground to selling it at the gas tank.  But just because the Big Oil 2019s big business model is being questioned  2014 and rightfully so  2014 doesn 2019t mean it 2019s going anywhere.  A few days ago, Fortune pointed out that many big oil companies are undervalued. Splitting them, in theory, could be worth billions of dollars to shareholders. But Big Oil companies need to consider many more factors than short-term shareholder perks before making such drastic decisions. Some may go for it, deciding to opt out of the integrated, one-stop-oil-shop model. But despite the changes major petroleum companies may experience, oil will likely stay Big with a capital B.  When it makes sense to be big, and when it doesn 2019t  Within the industry, different parts of oil companies are descried as sections of a river: upstream, midstream and downstream. A typical Big Oil company owns the whole river. Upstream involves looking for new wells, drilling them, and pumping crude out of the ground. Midstream means the transportation of new oil by ship routes and pipelines. Then you hit downstream, which is all about processing the product. Downstream assets include refineries, which distill crude into different chemicals, including gasoline. Gas stations, and other retail operations, are also downstream.  Big profits happen upstream. It pays well and pays quickly to strike oil, but companies have to spend a lot of money up front to explore new sites and then drill them.  When oil prices are low, it makes sense to have a hand in the refining and retail businesses, since both provide a steady stream of money that can fund searching for new wells and drilling. So when oil prices dipped during 1980s, then stayed low through the early 1990s, it spurred a mega-merger trend among major oil companies. Hence, we currently have companies like ExxonMobil, BpAmaco, and ConocoPhillips.  That model failed ConocoPhillips, which announced on July 14 that it will spin off its downstream division by the first half of 2012. The market reacted well to the announcement, and share prices of Conoco jumped 7.5% at the news, but the gap faded by the end of the trading day, closing at 1.6% higher than the opening price. Conoco 2019s breakup comes on the heels of Marathon 2019s announcement in January that it would undergo a similar split. The market loved it  2014 the company 2019s share price rose 30% after the announcement.  The success of these sales generated speculation that other big oil companies may follow suit. The refining business is volatile, and may be more trouble than its worth, some argue. Also, many  201cintegrated 201d companies aren 2019t actually integrated in practice, says Phillip Weiss, a senior energy analyst with Argus Research Group.  201cGenerally integrated oil companies do not refine the oil they produce, instead it goes to wherever is closest, 201d he says.  That was the case with Conoco, and many analysts are starting to look to BP BP as the next in line for a split. The company needs to refresh its strategy. Its stock is undervalued, many analysts say. One J.P. Morgan analyst argued that a BP split could unlock $100 billion worth of value for shareholders.  But BP probably won 2019t split. Not that the integrated model is ideal. It isn 2019t. But it 2019s very hard to cut a giant in half.  201cThe integrated model isn 2019t what it used to be and it may not be necessary, 201d says Weiss,  201c but if you have it, it may not be easy to get rid of it. 201d  Why Marathon and Conoco are exceptions  Marathon and Conoco were in better positions to split than other companies. Marathon in particular is different: while many oil and gas companies are shucking their refining businesses in America, Gary Heminger, CEO of Marathon 2019s downstream spinoff Marathon Petroleum, believes the company will have an advantage in the market.   201cOur strategy was that diesel sales around the globe are going to outpace gasoline, so we did something different, 201d Heminger told Fortune.  Instead of cutting off refineries, Marathon is upgrading them to produce a higher percentage of diesel than its competitors, which Heminger hopes will help the company meet growing demand in the global market.  Conoco, on the other hand, will probably focus the bulk of its business on oil exploration and drilling. But Conoco 2019s also in a slightly different spot than other super majors, Weiss says.  201cConoco 2019s not as large as Chevron cvx , Exxon xom , BP or Shell rdsa . Sitting where it did, it probably was better positioned to make a run at doing this than larger companies. 201d  In the wake of these splits, Big Oil companies will be looking at their assets to trim extra flab. But they 2019ve already been doing this. Chevron announced plans to sell several downstream assets this year, including a major refinery in Ireland. And Shell has trimmed its refining capacity by 40% over the last 12 years.  Since many major oil companies are looking to get rid of assets downstream, it can be tough to find buyers. That 2019s why Conoco 2019s spinoff makes sense, says Weiss, because it 2019s better for shareholders to create a standalone refining company then sell downstream assets too cheaply.  Breaking up is hard to do  As anyone who has ended a relationship will tell you, breaking up can be brutal, even when it 2019s the right call.  201cThe complexity of de-integrating these companies is massive. 201d says Alan Thomson, a Houston-based senior partner at The Boston Consulting Group.  You have to untangle shared departments, he says, such as environmental safety and finance. That 2019s why it does not make sense for a company like Exxon to split.  201cExxonMobil has always been the quintessentially integrated company, 201d Thomson says.  201cThey still very much manage that supply chain from crude to customer. 201d  Also, profit growth in refining may be slow in the U.S. and Europe, but having that ability can be an advantage in other places.  201cIf you have aspirations in participating in China, being able to offer a full range of technologies and capabilities is still  2026 very attractive, 201d Thomson says.  As the price of oil fluctuates, as it is wont to do, oil companies will mutate to profit most. Some will shrink and split. But for others, the best course of action will be to stay big. It all depends on whether the price of oil will stay high enough to warrant the headache of breaking apart the giants. Companies that split are banking that the price of petroleum to stay high. But if there 2019s any guaranteed uncertainty in this business, it 2019s the price of oil. Summary: Splitting up energy giants may make sense while oil prices are as high as they are today, but it may not be worth the organizational headache for Big Oil to break apart.",

Court records claim Parker  2013 who has been charged with rape, murder, child molesting, kidnapping, strangulation, aggravated battery, obstruction of justice, failure to report a dead body and unlawful disposition of a body  2013 was invited to Shaylyn's father's home the night she vanished.

            "input": "text:It 2019s not easy being the king. In Netflix 2019s case, being the most popular streaming-video service means that expectations for the company are sky-high 2014and so is the share price. When you trade at those levels, even the tiniest sign of weakness can trigger a wave of fear, which is exactly what happened after the company reported its latest quarterly results on Monday.  When Netflix announced earlier this year that it was expanding into more than 130 countries, the company 2019s investor fans got excited about the potential growth that this expansion might bring in terms of new subscribers.  Some of that growth has materialized: Netflix NFLX said it added 6.7 million subscribers in its latest quarter, including 4.5 million internationally. That beat analysts 2019 consensus forecasts. But the company 2019s projected growth is well below what most had expected. It will likely add just 2 million new international subscribers in the next quarter, when most analysts had estimated it would add 3.45 million. That 2019s a big miss.  On the Netflix earnings call 2014which actually took the form of a live interview with CEO Reed Hastings and other senior executives broadcast on YouTube 2014the company explained that its international growth is somewhat lumpy because of how the roll-out is working in different markets. In some cases, they said, there had been a big uptick because of pent-up demand, but that might not continue in the future.  Watch: Your Netflix subscription just got more expensive  Whatever the explanation, the lackluster forecast stoked the market 2019s fears that Netflix 2019s growth rate would start flattening compared to its past performance, fears that pushed the stock down by as much 14% in after-hours trading on Monday (the fact that Amazon just launched what looks like a significant Netflix competitor probably didn 2019t help).  It 2019s not as though Netflix will suddenly stop adding new subscribers or growing revenue 2014it 2019s more the rate at which those things happen that matters. When your stock trades at almost 100 times your projected earnings for the next year, you are essentially performing a kind of high wire act, and the downside risk is substantial.  Over the past year or so, Netflix has become the poster child for the cord-cutting phenomenon, in which younger video consumers either get rid of their cable box or don 2019t even sign up for one, preferring to use Netflix and other streaming services like Hulu.  Being the symbol of that movement, and building an impressive portfolio of hit shows like Orange Is The New Black and House of Cards, has helped the company achieve a market capitalization of more than $45 billion 2014which makes it more valuable than CBS, HBO and Viacom put together. Some of that premium is clearly justified, but how much? That 2019s what the market is currently trying to figure out.  Sign up for Data Sheet, Fortune 2018s technology newsletter.  One of the risks for Netflix is that its growth will slow simply because it already has more than 80 million subscribers, with about half of those in the United States. In a sense, most of the people in the U.S. who might want Netflix probably already have it.  That 2014along with increasing competition from Amazon AMZN , as well as HBO 2014means the company must continue ramping up its offerings of TV shows and movies to appeal to as many new users as possible. And that is going to require a massive investment in content production. This year alone, the company plans to add 10 feature films, 30 kids shows and 12 documentaries, for a total investment of $5 billion.  Some of this focus on original content is also being driven by the TV networks and other media companies that have licensed content to Netflix in the past, at fairly favorable rates. Many of these players are increasingly reluctant to give the company their best programming, in part because they want to roll out their own streaming services.  The end result is that Netflix 2019s costs are increasing fairly dramatically, and that is having 2014and will continue to have 2014an impact on the bottom line. Even in just the past year, Netflix 2019s operating profit margin has narrowed substantially: A year ago it was 6.2%, and in the most recent quarter it was just 2.2%. Those pressures are part of the reason why the company boosted its prices earlier this year.  There 2019s no question that Netflix is still sitting comfortably on the streaming-video throne. It 2019s going to take more than a forecast miss or a new Amazon video offering to topple the company from its perch. But kings have been deposed before, and it 2019s usually a messy business. That 2019s what many Netflix shareholders have nightmares about, and that 2019s not likely to change 2014if anything, it may get worse.

The best bets are its traditional Bavarian dishes with sauerkraut, but others, like sea bass crusted with rye and pilsner sauce, stand out as well. Entrees are $17 to $33. Venison, wild boar and other game dishes are served in the fall and winter.  7:30 p.m. 8 -- A Night at the Opera House One of the oldest movie theaters in America, the Shepherdstown Opera House (131 West German Street, 304-876-3704) first showed silent flicks in 1909. After falling into disrepair for years, it reopened in 1992 and now offers films each weekend (a schedule is at www.operahouselive.com; admission is $7). Get there early to order ginger beer and popcorn with real melted butter and to hear the short talks that often precede the films. More important, early birds can grab an extra pillow from a pile at the front of the theater -- the seats are harder than Yankee Stadium bleachers.

The prospect of peaceful coexistence between Microsoft msft , long seen as the archetype of proprietary, closed-source software company, and the leading backer of the open-source Linux operating system, would have been unthinkable just years ago. After all, RHEL and Windows Server have been duking it out for years in the server operating system wars.  But Microsoft softened its stance as it moved into the cloud era. It had to. The open source model, which makes source code available to developers for examination and deployment, has become such a huge force in technology that Microsoft had to change its ways.  In the open source world, a company like Red Hat rht sells services and support for the software, which itself remains low-cost or free. Clearly, that model was anathema to companies like Microsoft, Oracle orcl , and other companies that made their money selling proprietary software in addition to charging for support and service.  Get Data Sheet, Fortune 2019s technology newsletter.  But the open source wave was too big to fight and Microsoft, especially under its new chief executive Satya Nadella, is all about making Azure a cloud for all technologies. Microsoft must, too, because it is coming from far behind in the public cloud battle and has to make up ground against market leader Amazon amzn Web Services.  At a big Meet Azure event four years ago, Microsoft featured the MySQL database, WordPress, and Ubuntu Linux 2014all open-source products 2014 running on Azure. So, Microsoft Azure already supported Ubuntu and other Linux distributions, but Red Hat Enterprise Linux, which is widely adopted by businesses, was seen as the one that got away. It was a through-the-looking-glass sort of day.  On the same blog post, Microsoft said that Walmart 2019s wmt OneOps open-source cloud deployment tool will also run on Azure. The retail giant 2019s tech arm built OneOps to make it easier to move workloads to and from different cloud environments, in a bid to nix cloud lock-in.  Fortune Q&A with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.  Last November, Red Hat and Microsoft announced their intent to put RHEL on Azure, and as of today, customers can get the Red Hat images or sofware they need from the Azure Marketplace.  Update: This story is a bit more nuanced than first thought. A Microsoft spokeswoman said customers could already bring their own RHEL license and run the OS and other Red Hat products on Azure provided they register with Red Hat Cloud Access and build the software image needed to deploy on Azure.  This just shows what customer demand will do. As mentioned, RHEL competes fiercely with Microsoft Windows Server, but there 2019s been chatter for years that customers really wanted to be able to run RHEL on Azure even though they could already run it on Google goog Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services, Azure 2019s two main public cloud rivals.  So the people have spoken, and their suppliers apparently listened.  This story was updated at 7:53 a.m. February 18, 2016 to reflect that users could, starting in November, bring their own RHEL licenses to run on Azure and to add that Azure now supports Walmart 2019s OneOps cloud deployment tool.

On Tuesday, April 19, GOP frontrunner Donald Trump sat down with Fortune in a wide ranging interview on his business career and what he would do if elected president. A number of times in the interview he contradicted what he had said earlier in the interview, or something he has said in the past. The biggest change: Trump told Fortune that he no longer has plans to eliminate the national debt in eight years, as he had earlier claimed he would, but many economists said was impossible. It would require annual GDP growth north of 20% a year, if Trump were to lower taxes as he has pledged. That 2019s 10 times the 2% GDP has been growing recently.  Trump declines to say whether he had a plan for a contested election. And he said he had not yet made the determination of whether he would self-fund his general election campaign.  Related: Business the Trump Way  Trump declined to say who his campaign advisors would be. But he says he would be releasing a list of names within weeks. He says that there are a number of Fortune 500 CEOs and other executives advising him, but, as in the past, the only outside advisor he was willing to name was Carl Icahn. On a question of whether he had selected a chief economics advisor, Trump stumbled. At first he said he had, and wasn 2019t going to announce it. Then he said he would rely on a number of people for economic policy issues, and largely make his own decisions.  One person Trump is unlikely to name as an advisor: Janet Yellen. Trump says that Yellen had done a  201cserviceable 201d job as chair of the Federal Reserve. And he says he would be likely to put someone else in the position when Yellen 2019s term in over, which is not until early 2018.

But here are some his best sound bites from the interview:  On his business troubles in Atlantic City:   201cWhat happened is the bond holders came to me and said why don 2019t you put on debt. And I said let me look at it, and they offered me so much debt, and I said this is too much debt for the company.

But following the discovery that ears also act as tiny sound-producing loudspeakers, scientists are encountering many surprises as they probe the mysteries of hearing.  One recent result of this rapidly developing field of research has been the invention of instruments with miniature microphones that listen for the faint sounds emitted by healthy ears. Scientists believe these devices offer doctors a quick and reliable tool for detecting deafness, even in newborn infants, among whom deafness is otherwise hard to diagnose.  Physiologists are still marveling at the discovery that ears produce sound.  It is almost as astonishing as if the eye could produce light or the nose produce odors,  said Dr. William E. Brownell of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, one of the leading researchers in  otoacoustic emissions,  or sound produced by ears.  In a continuing Rhode Island study that began in 1989, microphone-equipped devices have been used to test the ears of some 4,700 newborn infants, and have already proved their worth in detecting problems early.  Dr. Susan J. Norton of Children's Hospital and Medical Center in Seattle, a participant in the Rhode Island clinical study, said,  It is unlikely that any of these children would have been identified before 12 months of age using previously available techniques.   But useful though otoacoustic emissions appear to be for clinical diagnosis, their main interest to scientists is in the light they shed on a baffling perceptual system that endows humans and other mammals with superlatively sensitive hearing over a wide range of frequencies and loudness. It is this system, some scientists believe, that made speech possible.  The notion that the ear might produce sound was suggested in 1946 by Dr. Thomas Gold, a Vienna-born astrophysicist, who reasoned that the high sensitivity of the human ear and its wide range of frequency response might be best explained in terms of some amplifying system analogous to those used in radio receivers. If that was the case, the biological amplifier might not only increase the intensity of electrical signals sent by the ear into the nervous system, but might also produce sound of its own.  In 1978 a major discovery lent substance to this prediction. Dr. David Kemp, an English physicist, discovered that the cochlea, a hollow, spiral-shaped bone in the skull that contains the organs of hearing, actually emits sounds.  These sounds, known as otoacoustic emissions, were found to be of two types: spontaneous and evoked.  Spontaneous emissions of sound are produced by the ears of normal people from time to time for no apparent reason. Although a microphone in the ear can clearly register such sounds, they are rarely noticed by the hearer, perhaps because the brain filters them out from the flow of signals that underlie perception.  Spontaneous emissions are apparently not related to tinnitus, or ringing of the ears, an ailment that can be caused by very large doses of aspirin, among other things. Dr. Glenis R. Long of Purdue University says that only about 3 percent of people suffering from tinnitus are found to produce spontaneous sound emissions of their own.  The other kind of ear-produced sound, evoked otoacoustic emissions, is similar to echoes, generally somewhat distorted from the original sound. The types of distortions found in these sound emissions appear to correspond to the kind of interference patterns that occur when one sound frequency is imposed on another.  A person who fails to emit echo-like sounds from his or her ear in response to a test tone generally turns out to be deaf, or suffering from disease or the influence of certain drugs. When a sound-producing device called a transducer is inserted in an ear canal and emits a brief click, a healthy cochlea responds a few thousandths of a second later by sending back an echo, which is picked up by a miniature microphone.  Scientists discovered that the otoacoustic echo response disappears when a person is taking large doses of aspirin, quinine, or psychoactive drugs. Aspirin, in fact, is known to cause temporary hearing loss. According to Dr. Long, people possessing  perfect pitch,  the ability to sing or whistle a specified note without first hearing it on a pitch pipe or tuning fork, lose some of this ability when taking certain drugs.  Significantly, the echo response disappears a few minutes after death. This, many scientists believe, implies that the otoacoustic response is the result of active sound production, not just a passive echo of external sound. Debate Over Cause  But this hypothesis has touched off a lively debate among physicists, electrical engineers, physiologists, biochemists and acousticians as to what actually produces the sounds that come from the ear.  One group believes that there is an active, electromechanical amplifying mechanism in the cochlea, similar in principle to electronic amplifiers, that is stimulated by an alternating electrical field produced by the stria vascularis, a tiny organ within the cochlea. Summary: BY picking up sound and transforming it into electrochemical impulses, the ears act like microphones sending coded signals through the nervous system into the brain. But following the discovery that ears also act as tiny sound-producing loudspeakers, scientists are encountering many surprises as they probe the mysteries of hearing.   One recent result of this rapidly developing field of research has been the invention of instruments with miniature microphones that listen for the faint sounds emitted by healthy ears.

            "input": "text:U.S. vehicle safety regulators have said the artificial intelligence system piloting a self-driving Google car could be considered the driver under federal law, a major step toward ultimately winning approval for autonomous vehicles on the roads.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration told Google, a unit of Alphabet googl , of its decision in a previously unreported Feb. 4 letter to the company posted on the agency 2019s website this week.  Google 2018s self-driving car unit on Nov. 12 submitted a proposed design for a self-driving car that has  201cno need for a human driver, 201d the letter to Google from National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Chief Counsel Paul Hemmersbaugh said.   201cNHTSA will interpret  2018driver 2019 in the context of Google 2018s described motor vehicle design as referring to the (self-driving system), and not to any of the vehicle occupants, 201d NHTSA 2019s letter said.   201cWe agree with Google its (self-driving car) will not have a  2018driver 2019 in the traditional sense that vehicles have had drivers during the last more than one hundred years. 201d  Major automakers and technology companies such as Google are racing to develop and sell vehicles that can drive themselves at least part of the time.  All participants in the autonomous driving race complain that state and federal safety rules are impeding testing and eventual deployment of such vehicles. California has proposed draft rules requiring steering wheels and a licensed driver in all self-driving cars.  Karl Brauer, senior analyst for the Kelley Blue Book automotive research firm, said there were still significant legal questions surrounding autonomous vehicles.  But if  201cNHTSA is prepared to name artificial intelligence as a viable alternative to human-controlled vehicles, it could substantially streamline the process of putting autonomous vehicles on the road, 201d he said.  If the car 2019s computer is the driver for legal purposes, then it clears the way for Google or automakers to design vehicle systems that communicate directly with the vehicle 2019s artificial pilot.  In its response to Google, the federal agency offered its most comprehensive map yet of the legal obstacles to putting fully autonomous vehicles on the road. It noted existing regulations requiring some auto safety equipment can not be waived immediately, including requirements for braking systems activated by foot control.   201cThe next question is whether and how Google could certify that the (self-driving system) meets a standard developed and designed to apply to a vehicle with a human driver, 201d NHTSA said.  Google is  201cstill evaluating 201d NHTSA 2019s lengthy response, a company spokesperson said on Tuesday. Google executives have said they would likely partner with established automakers to build self-driving cars.  Worries About People Undermining Safety  Google told NHTSA that the real danger is having auto safety features that could tempt humans to try to take control.  Google  201cexpresses concern that providing human occupants of the vehicle with mechanisms to control things like steering, acceleration, braking 2026 could be detrimental to safety because the human occupants could attempt to override the (self-driving system 2019s) decisions, 201d the NHTSA letter stated.  NHTSA 2019s Hemmersbaugh said federal regulations requiring equipment like steering wheels and brake pedals would have to be formally rewritten before Google could offer cars without those features.  For example, current federal rules require alerts on dashboards if tire pressure runs low. NHTSA said a test would need to be created that shows the vehicle computer is informed of the problem. NHTSA raised the question of whether humans in the vehicles should also be made aware.  In January, NHTSA said it may waive some vehicle safety rules to allow more driverless cars to operate on U.S. roads as part of a broader effort to speed up development of self-driving vehicles.  NHTSA said then it would write guidelines for self-driving cars within six months. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said the administration may seek new legal authority to allow deployment of autonomous vehicles  201cin large numbers, 201d when they are deemed safe, the department said.  The process of rewriting federal regulations governing the design, placement and operation of vehicle controls could take months or years. The NHTSA counsel said Google could consider applying for exemptions for certain regulations, providing NHTSA with supporting documents. Summary: They said Google's A.I. self-piloting system could be considered a driver under federal law.",

Orson Welles, a man who was physically and creatively bigger than life, died at his Los Angeles home yesterday at the age of 70. His physician said Welles had been suffering from diabetes and a heart ailment but gave no specific cause of death.  Welles was a legend in his own lifetime, which turned out to be both a blessing and a curse. As a young man he was hailed as a prodigy. At 22 he was writing directing and acting in critically acclaimed Broadway plays.  As 23 he frightened millions of Americans into believing Earth had been invaded by Martians, in his radio broadcast of H.G. Wells 2019  201cWar of the Worlds. 201d  At 26 he made his first movie,  201cCitizen Kane, 201d which became a classic.  New York Daily News published this on Oct. 11, 1965.  In later years he failed to interest Hollywood in his projects. So out of place did he feel in a community that once had embraced him that he refused to attend the Academy Awards ceremony when he was honored in 1970.   201cI 2019m an old Christmas tree, 201d he told his biographer, Barbara Leaming,  201cthe roots of which have died. They just come along and while the little needless fall of me, replace them with medallions. 201d  He found himself pitching wine on television, wrapping his sonorous voice, which had given life to Othello, Macbeth and King Lear, around the words:  201cPaul Masson will sell no wine before its time. 201d  Henry Jaglom, a director who has been close friends with Welles for 15 years and helped form the Weljag production company, said yesterday that Welles recently had raised money to finance a movie of  201cKing Lear. 201d   201cI just had lunch with him the other day and he was very optimistic and positive about life, full of hope for the first time in a long time, 201d Jaglom said.  Although Welles 2019 movies did not make money at the time of their releases they are among the best ever made.  Besides  201cCitizen Kane 201d there was  201cThe Lady from Shanghai, 201d  201cThe Magnificent Ambersons, 201d  201cOthello 201d and  201cTouch of Evil. 201d  He was born May 6, 1915. His father was an unsuccessful inventor and his mother a concert pianist.  In his youth Welles was known for his precociousness. Upon graduating from his school at 16 he sailed to Ireland, where he presented himself at the Gate Theatre as a visiting actor from New York though he never had acted in New York in his life. He was immediately cast in a lead role of  201cJew Suss. 201d  By the age of 20 he had acted in several role on Broadway and had begun his directing career under the New Deal 2019s works Progress Administration. He inspired controversy, staging an all-black  201cMacbeth 201d in Harlem and directing  201cThe Cradle Will Rock, 201d a play about the unionization of the steel industry.  When he made  201cCitizen Kane 201d the Hollywood method of movie-making was to tell a story in linear, chronological fashion. Welles used quick cuts and flashbacks to tell the story of a wealthy man, loosely based on William Randolph Hearst, who died mysteriously whispering the word:  201cRosebud. 201d  His height and voice made him a dashing leading man in his 20s and 30s and his prowess with women became nearly as legendary as his talent. He was married three times, first to wealthy Chicago socialite Virginia Nicholson, then to the beautiful actress Rita Hayworth and last to an Italian countess, Paolo Mori. He had a long public affair with actress Dolores Del Rio. His fondness for heavy food and drink ballooned his weight to near 300 pounds.  He made his last movie in the America,  201cTouch of Evil, 201d in 1957. Afterward he had trouble raising money in this country for his projects because he had developed a reputation for being unpredictable  2014 his movies took too long to make and were not profitable.  He continued to look for movie financing in Europe, where he made  201cChimes at Midnight 201d in 1960  2014 a pet project which wove together scenes from several Shakespearan plays. Welles cast himself as Falstaff. Summary: Orson Welles died at his Los Angeles home at the age of 70.",

In 2003, the Treasury  201cforecast 201d UK trade could expand by 50pc over the subsequent three decades if we joined the euro  2013 a forecast which, given subsequent European stagnation and the cataclysmic failure that is the single currency, today looks ridiculous.  And now, the same Treasury, led by senior mandarins keen to secure a gong, or a cushy number in Brussels, have produced yet another deeply-politicized document. Intelligent people can be on opposite sides of this referendum.  Those of us backing Brexit aren 2019t  201ceconomically illiterate 201d, Mr Osborne.

            "input": "text:When I was growing up, my father would go to bed with a transistor radio set to an all-news station. Even without a radio, my father was attuned to the menace of history. A Jew born in Vienna in 1924, he fled his homeland in 1938; his parents were killed in the Holocaust. I sometimes imagined my father was listening for some repetition of past evils so that he could rectify old responses, but he may just have been expecting more bad news. In any event, the grumbling static from the bedroom depressed me, and I vowed to replace it with music more cheerfully in tune with America. These days, however, I find myself on my father's frequency. I have awakened to anti-Semitism.  I am not being chased down alleyways and called a Christ killer, I do not feel that prejudicial hiring practices will keep me out of a job and I am not afraid that the police will come and take away my family. I am, in fact, more grateful than ever that my father found refuge in this country. But in recent weeks I have been reminded, in ways too plentiful to ignore, about the role Jews play in the fantasy life of the world. Jews were not the cause of World War II, but they were at the metaphysical center of that conflict nonetheless, since the Holocaust was part of Hitler's agenda and a key motivation of his campaign. Jews are not the cause of World War III, if that's what we are facing, but they have been placed at the center of it in mysterious and disturbing ways.  I was born in 1963, a generation removed and an ocean away from the destruction of European Jewry. My mother was born here, so there was always half the family that breathed in the easy air of postwar America. You don't have to read a lot of Freud to discover that the key to healthy life is the ability to fend off reality to a certain extent. Deny reality too much, of course, and you're crazy; too little and you're merely miserable. My own private balancing act has involved acknowledging the fate of my murdered grandparents and trying to live a modern American life. I studied English literature in college and in graduate school, where I toyed with a dissertation on Milton, a Christian concerned with justifying the ways of God to man. I dropped out of graduate school to become a writer, but I always felt about my life in America what Milton says of Adam and Eve entering exile -- the world was all before me.  Living in New York, pursuing my writing life, I had the world forever all before me. I chose within it -- I married and had a child. For 10 years I worked at a Jewish newspaper. But my sense of endless American possibility never left me -- even working at a Jewish newspaper seemed a paradoxical assertion of American comfort. My father's refugee sense of the world was something that both informed me and that I worked to define myself against. I felt it was an act of mental health to recognize that his world was not my world and that his fears were the product of an experience alien to me. I was critical of the Holocaust Museum in Washington. I didn't want ancient European anti-Semitism enshrined on federal land. But now everything has come to American soil.  Recently, I read an interview with Sheik Muhammad Gemeaha -- who was not only the representative in the United States of the prominent Cairo center of Islamic learning, al-Azhar University, but also imam of the Islamic Cultural Center of New York City. The sheik, who until recently lived in Manhattan on the Upper West Side, explained that ''only the Jews'' were capable of destroying the World Trade Center and added that ''if it became known to the American people, they would have done to Jews what Hitler did.'' This sentiment will be familiar to anyone who has been watching the news or reading the papers. In Kuwait, there were reports that New York rabbis told their followers to take their money out of the stock market before Sept. 11; in Egypt, the Mossad was blamed for the attack. It is easy talk to dismiss as madness, I suppose, but because so many millions of Muslims seem to believe it, and because airplanes actually did crash into the World Trade Center, words have a different weight and menace than they had before.  So does history, or rather the forces that shape history -- particularly the history of the Jews. It would be wrong to say that everything changed on the 11th of September for me. Like the man in the Hemingway novel who went bankrupt two ways -- gradually and then suddenly -- my awareness of things had also been growing slowly. My father's sister escaped in the 1930's from Vienna to Palestine -- now, of course, called Israel -- and I have a lot of family there. I grew up knowing that Israel, for all its vitality, was ringed with enemies; I knew how perilous and bleak life had become after the collapse of the Oslo peace process a year ago and how perilous and bleak it could be before that.  I knew, too, that works like the ''Protocols of the Elders of Zion,'' the Russian forgery about demonic Jewish power, have been imported into Arab society, like obsolete but deadly Soviet weapons. By grafting ancient Christian calumnies onto modern political grievances, Arab governments have transformed Israel into an outpost of malevolent world Jewry, viewing Israelis and Jews as interchangeable emblems of cosmic evil. So when the Syrian defense minister recently told a delegation from the British Royal College of Defense Studies that the destruction of the World Trade Center was part of a Jewish conspiracy, I wasn't really surprised.  I'd gotten a whiff of this back in early September, while following the United Nations conference on racism and discrimination in Durban, South Africa, where the Arab Lawyers Union distributed booklets at the conference containing anti-Semitic caricatures of Jews with fangs dripping blood -- a mere sideshow to the isolation of Israel and the equating of Zionism with racism that ultimately led to the United States' withdrawal. Singling out Israel made of a modern nation an archetypal villain -- Jews were the problem and the countries of the world were figuring out the solution. This was hardly new in the history of the United Nations, but there was something so naked about the resurrected Nazi propaganda and the anti-Semitism fueling the political denunciations that I felt kidnapped by history. The past had come calling.  I felt this in a different form reading coverage of Israel in European papers. Though public expressions of anti-Semitism are taboo in a post-Holocaust world, many Europeans, in writing about Israel, have felt free to conjure images of determined child killers and mass murderers. Earlier this year, the Spanish daily La Vanguardia published a cartoon depicting a large building labeled ''Museum of the Jewish Holocaust'' and behind it a building under construction labeled ''Future Museum of the Palestinian Holocaust.'' The cartoon manages to demonize Jews and trivialize the Holocaust simultaneously. Tom Gross, an Israel-based journalist, recently pointed out to me that a BBC correspondent, Hilary Andersson, declared that to describe adequately the outrage of Israel's murder of Palestinian children one would have to reach back to Herod's slaughter of the innocents -- alluding to Herod's attempt to kill Christ in the cradle by massacring Jewish babies. After leading an editor from The Guardian on a tour of the occupied territories, Gross was astonished at the resulting front-page editorial in that highly influential British paper declaring that the establishment of Israel has exacted such a high moral price that ''the international community cannot support this cost indefinitely.''  I understood that the editorial, speaking of the cost of the establishment of Israel -- not of any particular policies -- implied that Israel's very right to exist is somehow still at issue. (One cannot imagine something similar being formulated about, say, Russia, in response to its battle with Chechen rebels, however much The Guardian might have disagreed with that country's policies.) And this reminded me inevitably of the situation of the Jews in 1940's Europe, where simply to be was an unpardonable crime.  I had somehow believed that the Jewish Question, which so obsessed both Jews and anti-Semites in the 19th and 20th centuries, had been solved -- most horribly by Hitler's ''final solution,'' most hopefully by Zionism. But more and more I feel Jews being turned into a question mark once again. How is it, the world still asks -- about Israel, about Jews, about me -- that you are still here? I have always known that much of the world wanted Jews simply to disappear, but there are degrees of knowledge, and after Sept. 11 my imagination seems more terribly able to imagine a world of rhetoric fulfilled.  There are five million Jews in Israel and eight million more Jews in the rest of the world. There are one billion Muslims. How has it happened that Israel and ''world Jewry,'' along with the United States, is the enemy of so many of them? To be singled out inside a singled-out country is doubly disconcerting. There are a lot of reasons why modernizing, secularizing, globalizing America, whose every decision has universal impact, would disturb large swaths of the world; we are, after all, a superpower. Surely it is stranger that Jews, by their mere presence in the world, would unleash such hysteria.  And yet what I kept hearing in those first days in the aftermath of the attack on the World Trade Center is that it was our support of Israel that had somehow brought this devastation down on us. It was a kind of respectable variant of the belief that the Mossad had literally blown up the World Trade Center. It could of course be parried -- after all, the turning point in Osama bin Laden's hatred of the United States came during the gulf war, when American troops were stationed in Saudi Arabia. But it had a lingering effect; it was hard to avoid a certain feeling that there was something almost magical about Israel that made it toxic for friends and foes alike.  This feeling will not go away, if only because our support of that nation makes it harder to maintain our coalition. Israel has somehow become an obstacle to war and an obstacle to peace simultaneously.  Lately, of course, bin Laden has added treatment of Palestinians to his list of grievances, and this may revive the sense that Israel bears some measure of responsibility. Large lies can be constructed out of smaller truths. The occupation of the West Bank by Israel, though it grew out of a war Israel did not want, has been a nightmare for the Palestinians and a disaster for Israel morally, politically and spiritually. It is a peculiar misery to feel this way and to feel, at the same time, that the situation has become a weapon in the war against Israel. Bin Laden would not want a Palestinian state on the West Bank, because he could not abide a Jewish state alongside it.  Neither could many of our allies in the Muslim world, who keep euphemistically suggesting that if only the ''Mideast crisis'' were resolved, terrorism would diminish. It has a plausible veneer -- and indeed, it would be an extraordinary achievement if the Palestinians got a homeland and Israel got safe borders. But since most of the players in the Middle East do not accept the existence of Israel, since ''solving the Mideast crisis'' would for them entail a modern version of Hitler's final solution, the phrase takes on weird and even sinister overtones when it is blandly employed by well-intentioned governments calling for a speedy solution. And this Orwellian transformation of language is one of the most exasperating and disorienting aspects of the campaign against Israel. It has turned the word ''peace'' into a euphemism for war.  I grew up in a post-Holocaust world. For all the grim weight of that burden, and for all its echoing emptiness, there was a weird sort of safety in it too. After all, the worst thing had already happened -- everything else was aftermath. In the wake of the Holocaust, American anti-Semitism dissipated, the church expunged old calumnies. The horror had been sufficient to shock even countries like the Soviet Union into supporting a newly declared Jewish state. Israel after 1967 was a powerful nation -- besieged, but secure. American Jews were safe as houses.  I am not writing this essay to predict some inevitable calamity but to identify a change of mood. To say aloud that European anti-Semitism, which made the Holocaust possible, is still shaping the way Jews are perceived; Arab anti-Israel propaganda has joined hands with it and found a home in the embattled Muslim world. Something terrible has been born. What happened on Sept. 11 is proof, as if we needed it, that people who threaten evil intend evil. This comes with the dawning awareness that weapons of mass destruction did not vanish with the Soviet Union; the knowledge that in fact they may pose a greater threat of actually being used in this century, if only in a limited fashion, is sinking in only now.  That a solution to one century's Jewish problem has become another century's Jewish problem is a cruel paradox. This tragedy has intensified to such a degree that friends, supporters of Israel, have wondered aloud to me if the time has come to acknowledge that the Israeli experiment has failed, that there is something in the enterprise itself that doomed it. This is the thinking of despair. I suppose one could wonder as much about America in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, since many American values will now be challenged and since, in fighting a war, you always become a little like your enemy, if only in accepting the need to kill. I grew up at a time when sex education was considered essential but what might be called war education, what a country must do to survive, was looked upon with a kind of prudish horror. I suppose that will now change. In any event, Israel has been at war for 50 years. Without that context, clear judgment is impossible, especially by those accustomed to the Holocaust notion that Jews in war are nothing but helpless victims -- a standard that can make images to the contrary seem aberrant.  I have a different way of looking at the Israeli experiment than my friends who wonder about its failure. It is connected to how I look at the fate of European Jewry. When the Jews of Europe were murdered in the Holocaust, one might have concluded that European Judaism failed -- to defend itself, to anticipate evil, to make itself acceptable to the world around it, to pack up and leave. But one could also conclude in a deeper way that Christian Europe failed -- to accept the existence of Jews in their midst, and it has been marked ever since, and will be for all time, with this blot on its culture. Israel is a test of its neighbors as much as its neighbors are a test for Israel. If the Israeli experiment fails, then Islam will have failed, and so will the Christian culture that plays a shaping role in that part of the region.  I am fearful of sounding as though I believe that the Holocaust is going to replay itself in some simplified fashion -- that my childhood fantasy for my father is true for me, and it is I who am straining to hear Hitler's voice break over the radio. I do not. Israel has a potent, modern army. But so does the United States, and it has proved vulnerable to attack, raising other fears. The United States spans a continent, and its survival is not in doubt. But experts who warn us about American vulnerability refer to areas the size of entire states that will become contaminated if a nuclear reactor is struck by a plane. Israel is smaller than New Jersey.  I am aware that an obsession with the Holocaust is seen as somehow unbecoming and, when speaking of modern politics, viewed almost as a matter of bad taste if not bad history. I do not wish to elide Israel's political flaws by invoking the Holocaust. But that very reluctance has been exploited and perverted in a way that makes me disregard it. ''Six million Jews died?'' the mufti of Jerusalem, a Palestinian Authority appointee, remarked last year. ''Let us desist from this fairy tale exploited by Israel to buy international solidarity.'' (The utterance is particularly egregious because the mufti's predecessor paid an admiring visit to Hitler in 1941.) The demonizing language that is used about Israel in some of the European press, and about Jews in the Arab press, is reminiscent of Europe in the 1930's. I grew up thinking I was living in the post-Holocaust world and find it sounds more and more like a pre-Holocaust world as well.  Ten years ago, I interviewed Saul Bellow in Chicago and in the course of the interview asked him if there was anything he regretted. He told me that he now felt, looking back on his career, that he had not been sufficiently mindful of the Holocaust. This surprised me because one of his novels, ''Mr. Sammler's Planet,'' is actually about a Holocaust survivor. But Bellow recalled writing ''The Adventures of Augie March'' -- the grand freewheeling novel that made his reputation -- in Paris in the late 1940's. Holocaust survivors were everywhere, Bellow told me, and, as a Yiddish speaker, he had access to the terrible truths they harbored. But, as Bellow put it, he was not in the mood to listen. ''I wanted my American seven-layer cake,'' he told me. He did not wish to burden his writing at that early moment in his career with the encumbering weight of Jewish history. ''Augie March'' begins, exuberantly, ''I am an American.''  I, too, want my American seven-layer cake, even if the cake has collapsed a little in recent weeks. There is no pleasure in feeling reclaimed by the awfulness of history and in feeling myself at odds with the large universalist temper of our society. Thinking about it makes me feel old, exhausted and angry.  In the Second World War, American Jews muted their separate Jewish concerns for the good of the larger struggle to liberate Europe. I understand the psychological urge to feel in sync with American aims. But Israel sticks out in this crisis as European Jewry stuck out in World War II, forcing a secondary level of Jewish consciousness, particularly because the anti-Zionism of the Arab world has adopted the generalized anti-Semitism of the European world.  The danger to America, which has already befallen us, and the danger to Israel, which so far remains primarily rhetorical, are, of course, connected. And though it is false to imagine that if Israel did not exist America would not have its enemies, people making the link are intuiting something beyond the simple fact that both are Western democracies.  In ''Cultures in Conflict: Christians, Muslims and Jews in the Age of Discovery,'' Bernard Lewis points out that after Christians reconquered Spain from the Muslims in the 15th century, they decided to expel the Jews before the Muslims. The reason for this, Lewis explains, is that although the Jews had no army and posed far less of a political threat than the Muslims, they posed a far greater theological challenge. This is because Jews believed that adherents of other faiths could find their own path to God. Christianity and Islam, which cast unbelievers as infidels, did not share this essential religious relativism. The rabbinic interpretation of monotheism, which in seeing all human beings as created in God's image recognized their inherent equality, may well contain the seeds of the very democratic principles that the terrorists of Sept. 11 found so intolerable.  Is it any wonder that in the minds of the terrorists and their fundamentalist defenders, Americans and Jews have an unholy alliance? Expressing my separate Jewish concerns does not put me at odds with our pluralistic society -- it puts me in tune with it, since it is here of all places that I am free to express all my identities -- American, Jewish, Zionist. And if Jews kicked out of Spain clung, at peril of death, to a religion with such an ultimately inclusive faith in the redeemable nature of humanity, who I am to reject that view? Perhaps the optimistic American half of my inheritance isn't at odds with the darker Jewish component after all. In this regard, the double consciousness that has burdened my response to our new war need not feel like a division. On the contrary, it redoubles my patriotism and steels me for the struggle ahead.

            "input": "text:On Friday, TomKat jumped the couch. Katie Holmes filed for divorce from Tom Cruise after 5 1 2 years of marriage. Best-selling biographer Andrew Morton, author of  201cTom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography 201d (St. Martins Press), explains why it was a true Hollywood romance  2014 because from the beginning, Holmes was playing a part.  When Tom Cruise turned 42, his best friend, controversial Scientology leader David Miscavige, threw a lavish birthday party, costing an estimated $300,0, on board the church 2019s cruise ship.  He flew in singers, dancers and even Tom 2019s favorite sushi chefs for the bash, where the actor was serenaded with the medley of songs from his box-office hits.   201cIt 2019s the best birthday ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, and I mean ever, 201d he said, with typical understatement.  Tuesday, Tom 2019s 50th birthday, will lack some  201cevers. 201d He will be in his trailer in the wilds of Iceland, where he is filming the aptly named  201cOblivion. 201d Instead of the expected cards and presents from Katie Holmes, she sent him a confetti of legal papers and correspondence marking the end of their five-year marriage.  PHOTOS: TOM CRUISE AND KATIE HOLMES  KATIE PLOTTED ESCAPE FOR WEEKS  At least one thing he knows he 2019ll get is a call from Miscavige, to congratulate and console. Wives may come and go. Scientology is forever.  Holmes 2019 bombshell, in the midst of his international publicity campaign for  201cRock of Ages, 201d in which he stars as an aging singer, shows exquisite if cruel timing. Tom has admitted he was  201cblindsided 201d by her decision, just as Nicole Kidman, his second wife, was stunned when he abruptly decided to end their 10-year marriage even though she was pregnant.  As a leading member of a religion founded by science-fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard, Cruise doesn 2019t believe in karma. But Katie 2019s carefully executed escape plan means that, deliberately or not, she is getting one back for the sisterhood.  When he and Kidman divorced, Cruise effectively gained custody of their adopted children, Connor and Isabella. This time, however, Cruise has no such guarantees.  Holmes, presumably with the advice of her lawyer father, Martin Holmes, is playing hardball. She has hired a legal pit bull, New York lawyer Allan E. Mayefsky, who has been involved in several vicious splits, including the divorce of model Christie Brinkley. She wants full custody of Suri, the 6-year-old daughter Cruise dotes on.  Suri 2019s future education  2014 whether in the rituals of Scientology, like her step-brother and -sister, or a more conventional avenue  2014 will be a critical concern.   201cKatie doesn 2019t want Suri getting deeper into the cult, 201d sources tell me.  Suri is now at an age where she will face frequent formal interrogation about her behavior, what Scientologists call  201csec checking. 201d In the fight for the heart and mind of Suri, her future religion  2014 Katie was raised a Catholic  2014 will be critical.  Like Nicole before her, Katie will now not just be Tom 2019s foe, but also considered an enemy of the Church of Scientology. When news leaked of the breakup, former high-ranking leaders of Scientology contacted me to say:  201cWe told you so. 201d Since the beginning of the TomKat love fest, which began with the diminutive actor bouncing up and down on Oprah 2019s couch, they have known that the romance was as carefully choreographed by Scientology as his 42nd birthday party.  Even their prenup had, according to Scientology insiders, a series of mileposts where Katie would receive bonuses for how long she stayed with the actor. She received $3 million for every year of service, sources said  2014 with a big bonus if she gave him children.  In the months before they married, they claimed Katie had signed up for a five-year contract. Well, those five years are now up  2014 the couple married in November 2006.  For Katie to leave in this way  2014 she made the announcement to a  201csaddened 201d Tom  2014 shows how badly she wants out. Holmes saw what happened to her predecessor.  When the man dubbed  201cTom Terrific 201d dumped Nicole Kidman in early 2001, she learned that she had been written out of the script of his life by his lawyer, rather than in a face-to-face conversation.  Kidman was toast the moment she said in an interview that she embraced a number of religions, not just Scientology. Given the fact that her father is a psychiatrist  2014 deemed to be the mortal enemies of Scientology  2014 she was already suspect. These public pronouncements put her beyond the pale. For the church 2019s most prominent poster boy, his partner had to be a Scientologist.  After Nicole, the search was on for a new partner for Tom Terrific. It didn 2019t take long. Sparks had already flown between the actor and his new leading lady, Penelope Cruz, during the making of  201cVanilla Sky. 201d She was groomed as Kidman 2019s successor. He took the Spanish actress to Scientology 2019s Celebrity Centre in Hollywood and encouraged her to take a few courses.  While Penelope studiously read Scientology texts and attended auditing courses  2014 the equivalent of a confessional  2014 she was never really committed.   201cI have great respect for all religions, but I do not intend to join any of them at the moment, 201d she said tactfully, but fatally for her chances of marrying the Scientologist leading man.  When their relationship officially ended in 2004, no one was happier than her father, Eduardo, who had secretly been in touch with an organization based in Germany  2014 the most hostile European country to Scientology  2014 which helps members of cults and their families.  After the Cruz breakup, the lovelorn actor turned to his best friend, Scientology leader Miscavige, for help in finding a new wife. The diminutive church boss, who has a notoriously volcanic temper, became irritated with constant calls from Tom. As the head of a multibillion-dollar operation, he felt it was below him to be seeking out women for the Hollywood star. He deputized his wife, Shelly, to take over the task.  The first girl she chose seemed ideal. She was a Sea Org member, that is to say committed to working full time for Scientology. The girl found herself  201crunning into 201d Cruise, all the while thinking she was auditioning for a part in a movie. She dated Cruise a couple of times but then asked Scientology spokesman Tommy Davis, the son of actress Anne Archer, if she was being deliberately  201cset up. 201d  Her reward was to be told by Davis on Cruise 2019s behalf that the relationship was over. Then, according to friends, she was sent to a top security Scientology base and forced to scrub public bathroom floors with a toothbrush as punishment for messing up her assignment.  Tom had already moved on, briefly romancing 19-year-old actress Yolanda Pecoraro, whose only claim to fame was appearing as a bikini babe in the TV drama  201cDr. Vegas. 201d She did, though, bear a remarkable resemblance to Penelope Cruz. The daughter of a Nicaraguan mother and Italian father, she had been a Scientologist since the age of 13 and was by the side of the actor when he received a special Scientology award in November 2004.  When that hookup bit the dust, he gave Scientology leaders a wish list of women he would like to date. They included Jennifer Garner and the up-and-coming actress Sofia Vergara.  When Vergara got an invitation from Cruise 2019s friend Will Smith to attend a pre-Oscar party, she had no idea she was being set up. She was dazzled by Tom 2019s megawatt smile and amused by the blizzard of phone calls, flowers and chocolates that followed their first meeting.  It was not long before he casually suggested they head for Celebrity Centre where, surprise, surprise, Miscavige was waiting to layer on the charm. It soon became clear that she was being auditioned for the biggest role of her life  2014 Mrs. Tom Cruise Mark III. It was made clear that if she took the part, she would have to renounce her Catholic faith and convert to Scientology.   201cShe was fundamentally terrified of Scientology, 201d a friend told me.  201cShe sincerely believed that she would be struck down by God and burn in hell if she joined. 201d  Exit Sofia  2014 running for the hills.  After that debacle, the church went into overdrive to find him a partner. They put out a casting call for possible brides, telling them that there was an upcoming Cruise movie they might get a part in. Former Scientologist Marc Headley, who filmed many of the auditions, recalls that first they rounded up Scientology actresses like Erika Christensen, Erica Howard and Sofia Milos. None was deemed acceptable.  They were looking for a woman who would accept the teachings of Scientology, but who would also look good on Tom 2019s arm  2014 and not make too many waves.   201cThey had to look outside the herd, so to speak. They went for Jennifer Garner, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba, in that order. Jennifer and Jessica didn 2019t bite, but Scarlett took the bait and came in for an audition. When she arrived at the address and found out it was the Scientology center in Hollywood, she freaked out and didn 2019t do a tape. 201d  Finally, the Scientology casting crew hit on Katie Holmes, then 26, after they read an interview in which she said she would like to marry Tom. A senior Scientologist was sent to New York to give her the once-over. He liked what he saw.  She must have been thrilled. Ever since she was a little girl, she had told her three older sisters that she was going to marry Tom and live in a beautiful mansion where she would start the day by sliding from her bedroom into her own swimming pool.  Their first meeting was right out of the Cruise book of romance. He took her on a motorcycle ride to the beach at Santa Monica, later sending a limousine filled with chocolates and flowers to her apartment.   201cI was in love from the moment I shook his hand, 201d she later gushed. In the coming months, the former star of  201cDawson 2019s Creek 201d would turn gushing into an art form.  Tom, meanwhile, was bouncing up and down  2014 literally. Vergara watched their antics from a distance, and thanked her lucky stars.  201cShe had a narrow escape, 201d recalled a friend.  201cShe privately pitied the poor girl. Katie is a much weaker, more innocent person than Sofia. 201d  It had been only six weeks since Katie had broken off her engagement with actor Chris Klein, and now she was falling into marriage with a star 17 years her senior. Her family and friends watched in horror as they saw the normally vivacious woman turn into a Stepford Wife, silent, dutiful and stooping. She was now nicknamed  201cDead Eye 201d Holmes, the young actress cocooned by Scientology handlers wherever she went.  Katie may now regret signing in June 2005 a comprehensive contract with Scientology. But the reward was a proposal on top of the Eiffel Tower and marriage in an Italian castle in November 2006.  In her rare interviews since, her responses are brief, guarded and inconsequential, endlessly repeating the numbing mantra that her life is  201cmagical. 201d  But, hey, presto, the magic has worn off. Hollywood 2019s modern-day Snow White has woken from her dream. While she and her family face whatever hocus-pocus Cruise and Scientology try on them, the search will be on for Mrs. Cruise Mark IV.

            "input": "text:In contrast, Ajax made wholesale changes and the only outfield department to emerge unscathed was the attacking partnership of Nikos Machlas and Shota Arveladze, the Georgian having scored the goal which kept Ajax's frail hopes of progress alive.  Having been pulled apart in a 4-4-2 formation at home, Ajax ended the first game playing a match-up against Celtic and extended the tactic into the next instalment of the tie, with both sides using a 3-4-1-2 deployment.  It was evident immediately that this arrangement made Ajax considerably more potent, especially as Celtic steadily withdrew into their own territory, defending needlessly deep - proof of how seriously Martin O'Neill's men were taking the Dutch threat.  Only once in the first half did Jackie McNamara get ahead of his attackers into the box and that was to chase an angled pass from Henrik larsson that was played too near to Fred Grim.  Another declaration of intent was signalled when Abuhakari Yakuba was cautioned for a wild lunge at Larsson as Ajax showed their intention of salvaging their pride if not the tie.  To add to the mounting anxiety around Celtic Park, Ajax twice got into the vulnerable area behind Didier Agathe on the Celtic right, first to free Arveladze and then to spring Rafael Van der Vaart.  Wamberto, who was playing behind the Ajax front pair in the equivalent role to McNamara, proved considerably more effective at pushing into he box and he forced goalkeeper Robert Douglas into a frantic blocking save when he was allowed a free shot after 20 minutes.  Celtic survived but failed to learn the necessary lesson and paid the price on the half-hour. Again Wamberto wriggled through the Celtic back line, eluding Valgaeren before ramming a rising drive past Douglas.  Suddenly, Celtic's position looked much less assured and composure was required urgently but not only were they failing to make ground on the flanks, they were making trouble for themselves on the left where Steve Guppy looked very uncomfortable.  When he gave the ball away two minutes after Ajax scored he invited them to do so again. Ajax picked out Van der Vaart, who stung Douglas's palms as the goalkeeper turned the ball away.  Celtic's single clear opportunity of the opening 45 minutes came from a corner kick, which saw Sutton's header booted clear almost on the line by Christian Chivu.  An explosive moment arrived almost on the interval when Van der Vaart, maddened by a nipping challenge by Neil Lennon, booted Paul Lambert and was cautioned.  Ajax still needed to score two more goals in the next 45 minutes and Celtic had to dig deep to stop the flow and their nervous fans did their best to spur them on. Summary: Celtic (0) 0 Ajax (1) 1 (Agg 3-2)             Celtic reached the group stage of the Champions League for the first time after an edgy encounter with Ajax at a packed Celtic Park last night - but not in the manner that their partisans in the 60,000 crowd had anticipated",

More recently, however, the company has endowed that visual information with location-specific data 2014and published far more broadly, so that store managers and its corporate real estate team can use it for planning.  The system, called WalMap, can be used to visualize local community trends. A spike in flu medication prescriptions could help store managers decide earlier to order more vaccine, preventing shortages. Walgreens sales executives can reference trends in supplier conversations. Plus, the interactive maps can be used by the corporate planning team to determine the best place for a new store, based on community demographics, competitor information, and sales trend information. They can even be viewed on an iPad.   201cTen years, our teams had to print out a map and take it with them. Now they can bring their mobile device, and have access to updated sales, demographics and other targeted information, 201d said Jillian Elder, director of enterprise location intelligence for Walgreens WBA .  Occasionally the maps serve a higher purpose. Managers in Texas in September were able to help local authorities predict the next targets for a local crime spree.  201cWith some of our visualizations, we were able to put a stop to this, 201d Elder said.  Walgreens turned its maps interactive using the ArcGIS service from GIS company Esri, which has been its GIS partner since 2000.  The resource houses millions of maps available to companies that want to overlay proprietary data with the most up-to-data public information about specific locations. There are literally millions of maps published there. Most internal teams have access to basic information; Elder 2019s team created a special addition specifically for Walgreens 2019 real estate, strategy, and mergers and acquisition teams.

Log burners are all right, but not fireplaces,  Paul says. Don't get him started on Agas ( totally impractical, bad for the environment and expensive to run ) or wind farms ( the most stupid thing on the planet ). He's lived in an airtight house for the past 10 years, having come across the concept in Sweden.  I would never live without an airtight house and ventilation box. It's plain unhealthy,  he says.  A heat exchange unit enables the stale air leaving the house to heat the fresh air as it enters; there is no contamination as the fresh air is channelled through an adjacent yet separate part of the machine. In summer a bypass system ensures the incoming fresh air is not heated.  Building regulations in Britain don't permit airtightness. We had to really fight to do this,  Paul says.  Apart from the circular vents in each room and the lack of any smells (no paint aroma, even though building work has only recently been finished), you wouldn't have a clue the house is airtight. Perhaps the most blatant  eco  element is the solar park, but this is hidden in a field. Heat captured in the 20 panels is stored in rocks in the ground and distributed to the living space and swimming pool when needed.  Heat is even taken out of the house in summer and stored in the rocks for the winter,  Paul says.  The results are amazing. We are getting so much more energy than we expected.   Other more simple yet  totally obvious  eco components include a water recycling system, where water from roofs is stored and delivered to loos, washing machines and outside taps; and a sewage treatment plant which turns sewage into purified water.  Paul bought the farm at auction in July 2007; parts of it were falling down but he still had to pay about  00a31 million.  There is always demand for this kind of property  2013 I would have paid more for it,  he says. His builder, Steve Barton, an expert at traditional Cotswolds building techniques, maintained the basic layout of the farmyard and used original stone and beams to restore the barns. The middle barn now forms the hub of the house, with the sitting room and kitchen on the ground floor and stairs up to a glass landing, with the cinema at one end and a massage room at the other. The former dairy has been converted into the spa (pool, steam room, sauna, hot tub) and an extension houses the master bedroom with an enormous composite stone bath.  While the house will be cheap to run ( about the same as a small flat ) there has been no scrimping on building materials or fixtures. The roof cost  00a3100,000 and the kitchen, created by interior designer Sara Anton, features composite stone worktops and a Gaggenau fridge with electronic shelves.  Paul thinks Barnsley Hill Farm might sell to a city boy with a conscience, as a second home. There are certainly plenty of gizmos and gadgets; the temperature-controlled wine store in the dining room for example, and the integrated sound system and mood lighting. Barnsley House, an esteemed celebrity hang-out is a few minutes away - but the spa at the farmhouse is better, according to Paul, and why eat out when local celebrity chef Warren Hoile (www.oohlalacatering.co.uk) can come to your kitchen?  Mps and environmentalists are queuing up for a tour of the house.  The response has been astonishing. Next I'm going to build smaller, more affordable homes,  says Paul.  I want to show how easy it is to build amazing houses that are a joy to live in but low cost and low energy. The only thing stopping me is planning authorities and building control.   The most important energy reducing factor. The whole building is airtight.  An air system changes the air in the property once every two hours, replacing stale, damp air with warm, dry, filtered air.  Solar panels feed into underground system for year-round energy supply.  LED and low energy lighting throughout. Lighting the garden consumes the same amount of electricity as one traditional light bulb.  Feeds lavatories, washing machines and garden taps.  State-of-the-art system turns sewage into purified water. Summary: Restored Barnsley Hill Farm is an eco house with a spa, cinema and seven   bedrooms - and it uses just 10 per cent of the energy required to run a   normal house.",

You also have to bring a lot of clothes for 18 days. Actually, there was a little mishap with the luggage I had packed and not all my dresses, and some of my best ones, were available to me.  So I went with basic black, which is pretty standard for me and most magazine editors I know. It 2019s a Narciso Rodriguez dress from this season and has a nice little zip up the back. Narciso is always good on the details. And I tend to wear things that have a slimmer silhouette because I 2019m a fairly petite person. In some of the more voluminous things, I feel like I look like R2-D2.  The black dress also worked because I was going straight from the office to a cocktail party for the  201cHearst One Hundred Twenty Five 201d book signing at Rizzoli. The jewelry I wore were all personal pieces. I had on a Cathy Waterman floral patterned bracelet and a Tiffany bangle, which was a gift. My gold hoops I 2019ve had so long I don 2019t know where they came from. I wore my 10-year anniversary ring and also two bands: my daughter is gold and my son is platinum. I got a ring each time I had a child.  Generally, though, I don 2019t wear a ton of jewelry. I do have some estate pieces I love that my grandmother gave me. I 2019ll pull them out for the bigger events like our Women in Hollywood party.  The heels were Prada. I sort of liked the cage effect, and again they 2019re in black, so pretty practical. There are some people in our industry who wear runway pieces and wear them really well. I love the way Carine Roitfeld dresses. She looks amazing in her clothes. We have similar tastes, although I 2019m not saying I have the wardrobe that she does. I 2019m not somebody who wears the editorial pieces.  I do wear a lot of dresses because they 2019re just one unit and it 2019s very easy to put on and then you 2019re dressed. I don 2019t have to think too much. It has to be quick in the morning because I take my son to school. I imagine it 2019s the same for all working moms. There 2019s a whole life that 2019s lived before we 2019re out the door, so it better be pretty efficient.

            "input": "text:The boots on the ground at Bagram were overwhelmingly American. This was a town of 40,000 inhabitants and about 7,000 local ancillary workers, who came in daily. It had power and water plants, sewage treatment, waste disposal, recycling and landfill, industrial zones, suburbs of storage and newly built barracks, town planners and a director of public works. Management was outsourced to private contractors and staffed by civilians servicing Operation Enduring Freedom, the official name of the war in Afghanistan, which ends next month for the Americans, after 13 years (and when Bagram will finally be empty). Britain handed over its bases to the Afghan government two weeks ago.  My interest in Bagram stemmed from my work about Guant 00e1namo Bay, Cuba, published in 2010, where I made a series of pictures examining the institutional spaces of Guant 00e1namo naval base and its prison camps. Guant 00e1namo and Bagram are linked. The Bagram Theater Internment Facility, a makeshift US prison in a former Soviet aircraft hangar, preceded the prisons at Guant 00e1namo. It was replaced with a purpose-built prison in 2009, and between them, the old and new facilities have held more detaineees than Guant 00e1namo. Many who ended up in the latter passed through the cages in Bagram first, and I know men who were subject to interrogation and abuse in both.  A mural of the Hindu Kush mountain range in a meeting room PHOTO: Edmund Clark  Research told me that Bagram is situated close to the Hindu Kush mountain range, but it had not prepared me for the mountains 2019 constant looming presence. Depending on where you are, the time of day, the weather and the dust, they are on occasions indiscernible, at other times sharpened by light and snow, but always there. The mountains are inside, on the walls, too: meeting rooms with murals of the Hindu Kush  on all four walls, photos of planes against mountain backdrops, T-walls painted with images of soldiers and Afghans with the range behind them. Inside a dining facility I found simple paintings of mountains and monuments showing a different Afghanistan, by an Afghan artist called Majeed (I have no other information about him). These transcend the confines of the base, taking the viewer to passes and lakes in the Hindu Kush and other ranges.  The base perimeter, at midday, when the mountains are most indistinct PHOTO: Edmund Clark  My nine-day visit coincided with Eid al-Adha, the Muslim festival of sacrifice, and a period of enhanced insurgent activity. Most nights were punctuated by amplified chants of 'incoming, incoming 2019, and two to a dozen distant impacts. No one was killed inside the base. Outside, a man rammed his motorcycle into an armoured column. Only he exploded.  Wars of resistance are characterised by fluid insurgencies fighting more sophisticated occupying powers, stationary in their fortified enclaves; watching across a technological gulf and an abyss of mutual incom-prehension; waiting for the duration to sap resources and political will.  My work at Bagram juxtaposes the mountains of eight of my photographs with those in four paintings by Majeed and three poems by Afghan insurgents.  It is a reflection on the war in Afghanistan and the relationship between the mountains, the insurgents and the forces occupying the bases, the vast majority of whom never leave their enclaves. Their vision of Afghanistan is what they see over their perimeters or represented on the walls inside. Summary: Over 13 years, the US airbase at Bagram in Afghanistan evolved into a   self-contained world for its military and civilian inhabitants. In his new   book, the photographer Edmund Clark focused on the looming mountains that surround   this strange town",

The show, called  201cVice News Tonight, 201d will run weeknights for 48 weeks a year. Josh Tyrangiel, who was previously the editor of Bloomberg Businessweek and chief content officer for Bloomberg Media, was hired by Vice last October to oversee the show.  The daily show is part of Vice 2019s broader ambitions to make its programming available across the media spectrum. The company, which started as a free punk magazine in Montreal in 1994, introduced its own cable channel, called Viceland, this year.

It has also pushed to expand its presence internationally, announcing multiplatform deals with the Times of India Group and the Moby Group, a Middle Eastern media group.  Vice already produces a weekly newsmagazine show for HBO, called  201cVice, 201d which began in 2013.

Greece has more than twice as many doctors as the UK compared to its population, the report shows.  Experts warned of  201cacute shortages 201d of doctors among GPs and Accident & Emergency departments.  Dr Cliff Mann, President of the College of Emergency Medicine, which represents A&E doctors, said:  201cWe have been warning for some years that we have got fewer doctors than in most parts of the developed world. 201d   When you have shortages of doctors in some areas it means longer waits. In A&E that's not really an option, so it means doctors work harder and harder, it means there is a greater chance of mistakes, and ultimately it means risks to lives, he warned.  Around 500 A&E doctors who trained in this country are now working in Australia, he said - the equivalent of two years' trainees - because  201cburnout 201d levels were too high in this country.  Dr Mark Porter, chairman of British Medical Association 2019s Council, said:  201cAt present, the NHS is under incredible pressure from rising patient demand and flat lining funding. 201d  He said Wednesday 2019s Government announcement of extra funding for the NHS was a  201cstep in the right direction 201d but would not solve desperate shortages of doctors in some parts of the health service.   201cKey specialities such as emergency care and GP services are facing particularly acute shortages, 201d he said.  The OECD report found that the number of doctors in the UK has increased more rapidly than in any other EU country since 2000, rising by over 50 per cent between 2000 and 2012.  As a result, the number of practising doctors per 1000 population rose from 2 to 2.8, the report says.  201cThis nonetheless remains below the EU average of 3.4 doctors per 1000 population, 201d the report states.  The report says most of the increase in the number of doctors in the UK in the early 2000s came from doctors who came to this country from abroad.   201cWhile most of the increase in the number of doctors in the United Kingdom in the early 2000s came from the entry of foreign-trained doctors, the situation changed just before the economic crisis with most of the increase now driven by a strong rise in the number of graduates from domestic medical education programmes, 201d the report states.  The figures show Greece has the highest proportion of doctors per head of population, with 6.2 practising physicians per 1,000 people, followed by Austria with 4.9 doctors per 1,000. Germany has 4 doctors per 1,000 people, while Italy has 3.9, Spain has 3.8 and France has 3.3 doctors.  Poland has the lowest number of doctors per head of population, the report shows, with just 2.2 doctors per 1,000 people. Romania and Slovenia each have 2.5 physicians per 1,000 population, while Ireland has 2.7 doctors per 1,000 people, just below the UK 2019s figure of 2.8.

Schneiderlin runs into a congested right wing where three teammates are already perfectly positioned to launch an attack.  Nothing bad happens in this scenario - Schneiderlin gets to the halfway line and runs out of ideas but it's the kind of forward thinking play that can often land you in trouble. How many times have we seen Arsenal, as an example, abandon their posts and rush forward at goal, only to lose the ball and be outnumbered on the counter attack?  It isn't a coincidence that the Manchester United player was originally left out of Deschamps squad.  Diarra, by contrast, loves nothing more than sitting back and defending - he is a creative player's dream teammate since knowing there is always someone behind to mop up mistakes, makes it easier to try things and create chances.  The Marseille midfielder's record of seven goals in 299 club games suggests this is a player who rarely tries to find the back of the net and he can usually be found lurking out of frame during the action on TV, only getting the ball when an attack has broken down.  This is him against Armenia, the kind of nation that doesn't pose an enormous threat on the counter-attack at all (sorry Armenia).  And here he isn't for France's opening goal against Russia in a 4-2 friendly win. Summary: France have so much attacking power in their Euro 2016 squad that they didn't even bother including the spectacular Hatem Ben Arfa, who has scored 17 goals in 34 Ligue 1 games this season.",

            "input": "text:The season at Taos Ski Valley ended earlier this month, but its real estate is heating up.  Local real-estate agents call it the  Bacon bounce : Property sales at Taos Ski Valley, a rugged resort with European flair in the mountains of New Mexico, have multiplied since December, when New York hedge fund founder Louis Bacon said he was buying the ski area from a family that has owned it for decades. The deal is raising expectations that long-planned improvements will now happen.   The announcement gave us the final push,  said Peter Trevisani, who spent weekends at Taos Ski Valley for years before he and his wife Wendy bought a contemporary condominium in a Bavarian-style chalet in February. Now the couple uses the condo for weekends with the children, all avid skiers. They are also hoping the modernization of the resort will make it a good investment.  The Trevisanis, both managing directors at Thornburg Investment Management in Santa Fe, paid $750,000 for the 1,951-square-foot, three-bedroom condo, which is nestled between fir trees at 10,200 feet. It combines wood, earth tones and vintage ski advertisements with stainless steel and contemporary furniture.  In addition to the condo purchased by the Trevisanis, two more condos in the same development have changed hands since Dec. 13, when Mr. Bacon's intended purchase was disclosed. All three sold at asking price, one for $765,000 2014higher than most properties on offer at Taos Ski Valley, although still below the original, pre-downturn price of $1.2 million in 2008, when they were built. In all, 11 homes and eight plots of land have changed hands since Dec. 13, compared with two homes and one piece of land in the same period a year earlier.   For two weeks after the deal was announced, the phone rang off the hook,  said Keith Dowell, owner of Taos Ski Valley Realty.  It's quite unusual, especially at this time of the year,  added Jolie Jones, a real-estate agent with Pi 00f1on Investments of Taos who sold the units.  The activity comes after a long period of stagnation in the small ski town known for steep chutes, dizzying altitude and grand views across the high desert of northern New Mexico. At the same time, overall vacation home sales have been surging: Earlier this month, the National Association of Realtors said the number of second homes bought for part-time personal use jumped 30% in 2013, the biggest gain in 10 years. The West accounted for 28% of the purchases.  In an email, Mr. Bacon said his investment in the resort would be  substantial.   I knew it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,  he said.  Taos Ski Valley is one of the top ski areas in the country.  Mr. Bacon,57, is the founder and Chief Executive of New York-based Moore Capital Management, one of the biggest hedge funds in the U.S. with $14.9 billion under management. In 1992, he founded the Moore Charitable Foundation to support nonprofit organizations with a focus on land and water conservation. Mr. Bacon said he owns around 61.5 acres of land in Taos. He said he is an enthusiastic outdoorsman and has skied almost every run at Taos Ski Valley last winter.  Mr. Bacon wouldn't say how much he is paying for the resort, which he will own through a private entity. The deal is under contract, with its closing still subject to the transfer of a Forest Service permit.  Mr. Bacon's acquisition ends a family ownership that goes back to 1954, when Ernie Blake, a German immigrant who served as a U.S. military intelligence officer during World War II, flew his plane across the southern Rocky Mountains and spotted an old mining town near a big snow basin. Living in an 11-foot camper with his family, Mr. Blake built a resort that soon found a following for its expert terrain, bone-dry powder and plentiful sunshine. On the way up, skiers pass through the town of Taos, with its adobe houses, Native American Pueblo and a history of eclectic visitors, ranging from Georgia O'Keeffe to D.H. Lawrence.   It is a place that has so much more spirit than a purpose-built resort,  said Chris Stagg, the late Mr. Blake's son-in-law, ski school director and Vice President of Taos Ski Valley, which locals call TSV.  As other resorts were acquired by corporations and modernized, TSV didn't make major improvements. Its lift network was built in 1973. Skiers reach Kachina Peak, the highest point of the Ski Valley, only by hiking up a ridge, carrying their skis. The village looks dated, with a number of buildings from the 1960s and 1970s, and it lacks modern accommodations, spa services and restaurants.  Skier numbers have fallen. This winter, TSV sold 215,000 lift tickets, said Mr. Stagg, down from 220,000 last year and well below the 365,000 tickets sold at the peak in the 1994-95 ski season. Meanwhile, U.S. ski areas reported an 11% year-over-year increase in visitors in the 2012-13 ski season from the year before, the latest figure available from the National Ski Areas Association, a Colorado-based trade association.  In 2010, the Blake family drew up a Mountain Development Plan and a Village Master Plan for improvements to the resort. They were approved by the U.S. Forest Service and the town, but putting them into action, the Blakes estimated, would require $20 million. Last summer, they contacted Mr. Bacon about a sale.  The resort's renovation, Mr. Bacon said, will adhere to the plans, which include two new lifts, one of them to Kachina Peak, mountain bike trails for the summer and a more welcoming base area. Under the plans, the village will keep its European feel and family atmosphere, but offer better access for pedestrians, with a reconfigured parking system and skier drop-off area. The plans also aim to give guests an immediate view of the main lift, now partly obscured by stairs, and a  sense of arrival  that the village now lacks. In addition, there will be new condominiums, as well as restaurants and retail space.  The Blake family won't retain any stake in Taos Ski Valley, but Mr. Blake's son, Mickey, will retain a seat on the board of directors, while Mr. Stagg will remain Vice President. Chief Operating Officer Gordon Briner will become Chief Executive Officer.   I see this as a unique opportunity to build a sustainable business over the long-term, and do so by revitalizing the base area and facilities in a way that is consistent with the Blakes' vision, while preserving and protecting a vital natural resource,  Mr. Bacon said.  There are limits to how hot the market can get. The town of Taos is planning to build a new, longer airport runway, but for now, the nearest major airport is a three-hour drive south in Albuquerque. Some visitors are deterred by altitude of the resort, where the base is at 9,207 feet. In addition, the Ski Valley is small and has little room for expansion because most of the land is owned by the U.S. Forest Service. Some home buyers prefer to buy in Taos itself, 20 miles south, where it is warmer and sunnier, with more dining and shopping options.   Now that so many good things are happening at Taos Ski Valley, the challenge is to convince people to buy here, as opposed to the town of Taos,  said Jerome de Bontin. A French-born business man who until recently was general manager of the New York Red Bulls soccer team, Mr. de Bontin helped fund the Village Master Plan. With several partners, he plans to redevelop three parcels of land in the base area, including adding a  parking club  where day-use members have showers and valet services. He also plans to develop an upscale hotel and condominiums.

She 2019s the author of Makers and Takers: The Rise of Finance and the Fall of American Business.  Here 2019s a telling numerical contrast that says a lot about the state of business and the economy in America today: the new Fortune 500 list shows that overall growth for big business stalled in the last year, with profits dropping 11% for firms on the list. Yet just last week, the Wall Street Journal reported that CEO pay was rising. The figures might seem to be in opposition but, in the increasingly Kafkaesque world of big business and the capital markets, they aren 2019t.  Why? For the last couple of years, corporate earnings have been flattening out, as Main Street has struggled along in the longest, weakest recovery of the post World War II era. This despite markets being buoyed by historically low-interest rates and the Fed 2019s $4 trillion money dump post financial crisis. As stocks have gone way, way up, so has corporate pay. As the WSJ reports,  201cPay across the survey rose by a median 5.5% to $11.4 million, nearly two-thirds of which was tied to performance. 201d  The key word there is performance. Performance pay is typically awarded in stock options, which have special tax benefits, thanks to changes in how executive pay can be doled out made in the 1990s. Of course, it 2019s best for CEOs to exercise such options when the markets are high. And that gets us to the record number of share buybacks that have been pulled off by corporations in the U.S. over the last couple of years. Buybacks, which essentially involve companies buying up their shares on the open market, jacks up the price of the stock.  Some, like Warren Buffett, argue that they can be a mark of a company 2019s belief in its own future potential. But what 2019s interesting is that the majority of recent buybacks have been done during market peaks, not so much as a way to express belief in the future, but to cash in on the present, and ensure that share prices remain up. Even if the underlying growth story on Main Street isn 2019t bullish 2013certainly the case these days (witness last Friday 2019s disappointing job numbers).  The result is a market that goes up, and enriches the 10% of the population that owns 80% of the stock (and particularly lines the pockets of the C-suite), but no real change in the underlying corporate growth story (witness those falling profits). If companies were putting all that back all that buyback money in things like worker training, research and development spending, factory and technology upgrades, or even (gasp) worker pay, the Main Street story might change. But they aren 2019t. This process of  201cfinancialization, 201d by which the markets rule Main Street rather than the other way around, is something of deep concern for American capitalism 2019s future.  Sadly, I fear that the contrast between corporate profits and corporate pay means we may be at a tipping point. There is very little ammo left to artificially bolster stock prices in the absence of real economy growth, and stronger job creation (and even more importantly, the creation of better paying jobs 2013much of what we are creating is low-level service work). At some point, everything in the markets must connect back to Main Street. Summary: Profits at big companies are down 2014but CEO pay is up",

After years of hogging Emmys, viewers 2019 hearts and the political-comedy spotlight with Jon Stewart 2019s Daily Show and Stephen Colbert 2019s Colbert Report, it 2019s no surprise that the follow-ups would seem not just less successful but unsuccessful. It 2019s tough to follow a legend, and Daily Show replacement host Trevor Noah as well as Nightly Show host Larry Wilmore (entering Colbert 2019s 11:30 p.m. timeslot) suffered, from their shows 2019 first moments, by comparison.  So while the timing 2014both early into the show 2019s run and at the height of a pitched presidential election 2014is unfortunate, it comes as no surprise that Comedy Central is trying something new at 11:30. Larry Wilmore 2019s Nightly Show has been cancelled, putting an end to an interesting and unusual experiment: A late-night chat show focused in large part on the subject of race. (It 2019s worth noting the unfortunate fact that Wilmore 2019s departure from late-night makes the genre significantly less diverse.) While less catastrophic a comedown than Noah 2019s inept handling of The Daily Show franchise, Wilmore 2019s show still felt strangely disconnected, hamstrung by its attempt to launch a star and a manner of viewing the news at a time when the news was moving too quickly to allow for introductions.  Those comedy stars who 2019ve been able to succeed against the backdrop of a presidential election without precedent have used established personae to deliver finely honed messages. Colbert is among them: After a rocky start at CBS 2019s Late Show last fall 2014and a first episode distinguished by an anodyne interview with Jeb Bush that diminishes in memory 2014the host has harnessed the wildness of our current election, particularly the deeply unconventional Republican convention, to produce his absolute best material. Like NBC 2019s Seth Meyers, another star who 2019s made the most of the election, Colbert is a host that gets more and more lost in the background the more politics unfold as usual. On TBS, meanwhile, Samantha Bee has introduced new, remarkable shadings of rage and indignation to a tone and style familiar from her years as a Daily Show correspondent.  Unlike Bee, Meyers or Colbert, Wilmore had a relatively limited baseline. When they get furious or fed up or just go on a tangent, it means something. All things being equal, Wilmore 2019s introduction to much of his audience concurrent with the sort of news that moves a comic to shift into a new gear was a huge disadvantage. The manner in which Wilmore expressed his annoyance 2014an unfamiliar abrasiveness in contrast to Colbert 2019s intellectualized buffoon 2014likely turned some viewers off, as well. Consider Wilmore 2019s controversial gig at the White House Correspondents 2019 Dinner, in which he called the President the  201cn 201d-word and railed against the media harder even than the savagest previous hosts. It 2019s not that it wasn 2019t funny, and it 2019s not that he didn 2019t make fair points. But Wilmore was so relatively unknown that, while doing less would have made less of a splash, doing quite so much with so little finesse felt like one more loud voice in the year of Trump.  I 2019d argue that Noah and Wilmore have precisely the opposite problems: Noah is too laconic by half, checked-out of a presidential election his whole shtick is to pretend (or acknowledge) that he doesn 2019t understand by virtue of his South African citizenship. Wilmore never got the chance to nail the  201ccomedy 201d part of  201cpolitical comedy, 201d so quickly has the current election outpaced a novice host 2019s ambitions as well as reached into rich veins of potential inquiry unrelated to Wilmore 2019s core mission. There was plenty on the series that was well-put-together 2014the episode airing in the immediate aftermath of Pulse shooting in Orlando caught my eye. But in the main, being forced to respond to a presidential election that defied satire did Wilmore no favors. Perhaps, had this been the ho-hum Hillary Clinton-Jeb Bush matchup many people expected, people would be casting about for new, intriguing voices; Wilmore 2019s focus on race would have allowed him to do interesting stuff while the two nominees sought to be the most inoffensive. But that 2019s not how it shook out. Only the most tested and shrewdest stars have been able to make hay out of a race whose coverage, itself, is the entertainment.

But the premier told a business event in Adelaide on Thursday that despite the state's high unemployment, decline in manufacturing and power problems, the state has plenty to feel encouraged about, such as boosts to business confidence and investment.   Certainly, our unemployment rate is too high,  Mr Weatherill said, which is again the highest in the nation at 6.7 per cent.   Commodity prices remain low, our traditional manufacturing base is on the decline and we're being held back by an outdated national electricity market.   But the premier said retail sales were strong, tourism was on the rise and the defence industry offered  virtually limitless possibilities , especially the submarines project.   The future submarines build will generate jobs and economic activity for decades to come,  he said.   Indeed, it's possible that some of the South Australians who will eventually work on that project haven't even been born yet.   Few people in this state are able to envisage the full scope and implications of the submarines work.   Mr Weatherill has also hailed the success of the state's Investment Attraction Agency, which was set up a year ago to attract new investment that created sustainable jobs.  He said it had secured 12 major projects worth more than $970 million, generating 4500 jobs in the process.  Friday will be five years since Mr Weatherill was sworn in as premier, replacing Labor leader Mike Rann.  After a strong start and successfully returning the ALP to government in 2014, the premier has had difficulties, including dealing with the fallout from the royal commission into child protection and the recent statewide blackout.  He has also championed the debate over increasing South Australia's future role in the nuclear fuel cycle, including the possibility of storing the world's high-level nuclear waste.  The premier said his government would continue to pursue the same three-pronged strategy it began with - investing in job creation and infrastructure to foster economic growth and ensuring the state's voice was heard on national issues. Summary: On the eve of his fifth anniversary of becoming South Australia's premier, Jay Weatherill says his state faces several challenges but should feel encouraged.",

Now, the Russians are getting into the act, with clever computer hacks designed to disrupt US elections by remote control.  Federal officials say that Russian hackers are behind breaches of voter registration systems in Arizona and Illinois, and a breach at a contractor for the Florida elections office. In addition,  201cthere have been attempted hacks in almost every state, 201d said Denise Merrill, Connecticut 2019s secretary of state and president of the National Association of Secretaries of State.  It 2019s conceivable such attacks could throw the Nov. 8 election into chaos. But it 2019s improbable. Hackers can 2019t get into our voting machines and outright change results.  The hackers can, however, mess with voter registration rolls, possibly affecting who can vote on Election Day. That would definitely sow confusion, but again, specialists and elections officials insist that there are enough safeguards and backups to protect the integrity of the vote.  Nonetheless, even the whiff of a threat is hardly welcome in the current political environment. For days now, Donald Trump has been whipping up public outrage with claims that the US election is  201crigged. 201d Evidence of Russian attacks on our voting system would reinforce that narrative and could further embitter an already vitriolic presidential race.  Let 2019s consider some background about how elections work.  Thanks to the American tradition of federalism, elections are wonderfully decentralized. Votes are recorded at 13,000 local jurisdictions, each with its own bureaucracy and technology. And through a combination of good sense and happy accident, those voting systems can 2019t really be hacked remotely for the simple reason they are not connected to the Internet.  In a previous article, I quoted an expert who said that some vote tabulation systems are online. Wrong, according to the National Association of Secretaries of State.  201cThe equipment that people vote on is not connected to the Internet, 201d the association said in an open letter to Congress in September.  201cVote counting is never done with systems connected to the Internet, and tabulation systems are not networked. 201d  Sure, there are weak spots. For example, Virginia in 2015 decertified thousands of older touchscreen voting machines after an investigation determined hackers could break in via their Wi-Fi cards and change voting results.  There are also 31 states that allow Americans overseas to submit their votes electronically. But even these votes are printed out on paper before being counted. Any effort to tamper with a significant number of them would likely be easily detected.  Back in the States, voting remains resolutely offline. In Massachusetts, for instance, ballots are collected and counted by a scanner in each precinct. The count is put onto a printout or stored on a digital memory card, and this is carried to the community 2019s town hall, where the votes are recorded.   201cIt 2019s a closed system, 201d said Brian McNiff, a spokesman for Massachusetts Secretary of State William F. Galvin.  201cIt 2019s not on the Internet. 201d  A far bigger risk are all-electronic machines that don 2019t generate a paper record of each vote that can be used in a recount. These are used in about a dozen states and ought to be retired. Still, since they are not connected to the Internet, they 2019re not in danger of being hacked from afar.  But some state systems that collect and store information about which voters are properly registered to cast a ballot are online, and it 2019s here where the bad guys could get in and do some damage.  The most serious threat would be a partial deletion or corruption of voters 2019 data, such that people may show up at the polls Nov. 8 only to be told that they weren 2019t registered to vote, on a large enough scale, such an attack could cause severe disruptions.  But voter registration data is typically printed out by election officials in advance. Think of those thick books they use at the polling place to check off your name. A proper hack would likely have to occur weeks ahead of the election and, just as likely, would be spotted. Indeed, federal officials are on high alert, and the Department of Homeland Security said 33 US states and 11 local governments so far have asked for help in checking the security of their voting systems.  Even if hackers were somehow able to get past these defenses and corrupt the registration files, there are workarounds. In most places, you can show some ID and cast a provisional ballot that will preserve your vote until the voter database is restored from a backup copy.  One troubling possibility would be a hack of the Associated Press, which provides news organizations around the country with updated vote totals throughout election night. Imagine a report coming out early in the night that falsely shows Hillary Clinton sweeping every state in the Eastern United States; that might discourage Donald Trump voters in Western states from coming out to vote. Then when the official  2014 and accurate  2014 results are revealed, there 2019d be a firestorm of public outrage.  An AP spokesman declined to describe his organization 2019s security plans, simply saying that  201cAP has been working diligently to ensure that vote counts will be gathered, vetted and delivered to our many customers on Nov. 8. 201d  Merle King, executive director of the Center for Election Systems at Kennesaw State University in Georgia, is in the camp of those who think it 2019s highly improbable hackers will disrupt the election. But, as King warns, they might not have to, as the mere suspicion of electoral hacking has further poisoned an already toxic political climate.   201cIt 2019s a pretty high risk that after the election we 2019re going to be dealing with the fallout, 201d King said.  201cI think it is starting to combine with other factors to erode confidence in the outcome of the election. 201d Summary: We 2019re outsourcing everything else in America these days.

He called for a new health minister to get the $150 million project over the line, after a senior doctor at the hospital spoke out about dire conditions at the facility.  Mr Sidoti retreated from the comments after they hit the front page on Tuesday, and has since called the health minister to apologise.   I'm not going to make any excuses or sugarcoat it - I got it wrong,  Mr Sidoti told reporters in Sydney.   Am I frustrated? Am I upset? Am I emotional? Of course, I am,  he said.

King tides aid exploration of SF's hidden old coal mine  Last year we told the story how in 1891 an old miner discovered a vein of coal within the city limits of San Francisco at Land's End, inspiring magnate Adolph Sutro to tunnel into a cliff overlooking Baker Beach.  The now nearly forgotten mine, on a cliffside 200 feet below what was once the Ferries Railway track, was never fully developed. Years of high tides, harsh weather and subsidences have eroded its passages.  This week, Jon Ehman, a professional services manager for a local tech startup, took advantage of the extremely low-tide water level that occurs during the king tides in order to explore the mine.  Over the years the water level has gradually risen, making accessing the mine difficult and dangerous.   There is a limited window on how long you can stay out there due to the rising tide,  Ehman said in an email.  Basically, the tide needs to be less than minus one foot. Any higher you risk getting stuck in the coves.   To safely enter the mine, Ehman recommends rope or other climbing gear. One of the three openings, on the face of the cliff, can be reached without technical gear, but it requires free-climbing skills. Ehman watched an experienced rock climber scale the precipice to the entrance in about 10 minutes.  Ehman found a number of objects  2014 some evidently old mining machinery parts  2014 exposed by the tide. Normally they remain hidden under several feet of water.

In a recently surfaced 12-hour videotape, Hilton is shown in a rather disturbing scene with two African-American men who ask her if she would model their fashion line.  Hilton, standing with pal Brandon Davis, is polite to the men, but calls them  dumb n--s  after they leave, according to British reporter Carole Aye Maung, who reviewed the tape.   Two ... guys begin talking to her,  Maung told us.  She's being very, very sweet to them. [But] she definitely uses the N-word. It's so cruel, because they were so lovely, and she was being so lovely to them.   Hilton's reps refused to comment when asked about this specific incident on the tape, first uncovered by Star magazine.  According to Maung, the marathon recording includes footage of Hilton  making love  with Nick Carter in the back of a car, greeting one-time boyfriend Jason Shaw in the nude and rolling a  cigarette.   She jokes:  It'll be Paris Hilton Two: How to roll a joint.   It's doubtful she's laughing today.  Martha Stewart's going deeper inside to go  inside.   Sources close to the hoosegow- heading homemaker tell us that she has been studying meditation techniques as a way of coping with life at the federal prison she'll enter next week in Alderson, W. Va.  They add that Stewart has conferred with consultant David Novak, who served 10 months in prison and wrote  Downtown  about the experience - though Novak tells us,  I never comment about my clients.    Martha's been told that there's a total lack of privacy and that it's very noisy,  says one source.  She's been meditating to help deal with it.   Stewart, who will serve five months in prison for lying to the government about a stock trade, expressed her disappointment yesterday that she will not be sent to a prison where her 90-year-old mother can visit her more easily.

Wilson had accused DiCaprio and his friends of harassing  Showgirls  star Elizabeth Berkley. The actor and screenwriter was dating Berkley at the time and became angry when DiCaprio and Co. supposedly called her repeatedly to get her to come to the restaurant.  Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Paula Omansky said that while DiCaprio may have said something like  someone should kick this guy's a-,  there's no evidence that the man who actually punched Wilson in the throat, Todd Healy, heard DiCaprio. However, Omansky said a suit against Healy may proceed, reports Helen Peterson of the News.  A word to the wise  A.J.

            "input": "text:Did you ever wonder what is what like growing up the son of James Bond?  Meet Carl Colby, son of the late C.I.A. director William Colby, who has attempted to piece together his father 2019s life from his career beginnings as an OSS officer in Nazi-occupied Europe to becoming the 10th Director of Central Intelligence from 1973 to 1976 in the powerful documentary  201cThe Man Nobody Knew. 201d   201cTwo weeks after I was born we left for Sweden, then we left for Italy, and I came back to the United States really for the first time as a twelve year old. I spoke better Italian and French than I did English back when I was young. So it was an odd, foreign country to me, but it was supposed to be my home, 201d Colby told FOX411 2019s Pop Tarts column of his own childhood.  201cOnly gradually did I understand really that not everybody works for the government. 201d   201cThe Man Nobody Knew 201d offers a look at the elder Colby's mysterious life, complete with interviews from former wife Barbara Colby, former senator Bob Kerrey and former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. The movie touches on several dramatic milestones, from joining forces with the Vatican to defeat the Communist Party in Italy in the 1950s to the unraveling of the Vietnam War and the assassination of the country 2019s president Ngo Dinh Diem in 1963.  It also shows how much times have changed.   201cWhen my father was director of the C.I.A., he left his home phone number in the directory, in a directory that anyone can call up and talk to him, 201d Colby continued.  201cUnfortunately, a couple of people did call. One person said to my younger sister,  2018We 2019re gonna kill your father. 2019 And then one day someone called and my mother answered, and they said  201cAll the arrangements have been made, 2019 and she said  2018Arrangements for what? 2019 and they stated  201cYour husband 2019s burial. 2019 She said,  2018What are you talking about? 201d 2019and they just said  2018All the arrangements have been made,' and then just hung up. So you 2019ve a sense that he had enemies, but to be honest with you, he was so cool under fire. I never feared for my life because he never projected that. 201d  And although Colby 2019s death in 1996 from a boating accident was ruled caused by a heart attack, (Colby was found underwater), his son thinks it may not have been accidental.   201cIn a lot of ways I think he was done. He lost his mission after he resigned or was fired by President Ford [in 1976]. He reverted to being, maybe what he once was in his late 20s, a kind of liberal lawyer. He bought new clothes, bought a sports bar and sort of just started a whole new life, 201d Colby explained.  201cThey said he had a heart attack or a stroke, but it 2019s also the best way to hide anything to just throw somebody into the water because after a few hours there 2019s no sign of anything. But I think he had had enough of this world. He never wanted to grow old. 201d  In putting together his documentary, Carl Colby also wanted to answer one simple question.   201cAre we important? A child asking a parent if we were important, if were a family, or if we just a cover for him, 201d Colby said.  201cWas there real affection? Or was it just a smoke screen? He divorced my mother so we know how he really felt about her. I spent a lot of time thinking about that question  2013 and I think the answer is 'no.' We weren 2019t ever a real family. 201d   201cThe Man Nobody Knew 201d is currently playing in New York and opens in Los Angeles on October 14.

            "input": "text:I. Cannes: The Slow Drive to Triumph  Stuck in traffic in a black sedan on his way to the Palais des Festivals for the Cannes International Film Festival premiere of his new movie, 'Bad Education,' Pedro Almod 00f3var seemed, as he often does, both anxious and curious. He fidgeted, he fussed. When he rolled down the window, the paparazzi, who were walking three-deep alongside the slow-moving car, screamed at him: 'Pedro! Pedro!' and cut off his view of the street, where his image was plastered on walls and where fans waited to mob him. He strained to see past all this. He was intrigued by what one woman in the crowd was wearing, by the relationship -- which was what, exactly? -- between two men eating ice cream. He was looking for details, a hint of narrative, the movie.  They recognized him instantly, the photographers and fans, through the rolled-down window: the trademark salt-and-pepper pouf of his hair rose like a corona surrounding his head. He was dressed tonight in a custom-designed Christian Dior tuxedo and was wearing dark sunglasses and looked, as he idled in traffic, like a teenager who had dressed up for a party he couldn't wait to get to, or maybe not. He is in his 50's now but has the bouncy effervescence of a child. It's one of the character traits, but only one, that has played a part in making him arguably the most original and daring filmmaker working today.  In his work, Almod 00f3var is steeped in what came before him, but he's also unrestrained by it. He has always been interested in a mix of the traditional and the transgressive. In Almod 00f3var's films, there is the real, the concrete, but it is always heightened by intense visual effects (saturated colors, stunning clothes and objects) and especially by extreme characters who act in extraordinary ways. In a dreamy, almost childlike manner, he depicts gender and sexuality as fluid: in Almod 00f3var's world, women were once men; men pose as women; transsexuals can be fathers or mothers. Almod 00f3var presides over his shifting characters like a benevolent priest: he accepts and forgives nearly all of them, no matter how terrible their sins. A kidnapper or rapist or pedophile can have a pure heart; of course, the seemingly innocent can also be guilty. ''The cinema is my work and what gives meaning to my life,'' he said to me as the sedan went nowhere fast. ''In film, my hope is to meld reality and fantasy -- and everything goes into that ideal.''  Growing up in Spain, Almod 00f3var experienced a cross-section of influences: from the Spanish masters (Vel 00e1zquez, Goya) to Pop Art (Warhol); from the surrealist films of Luis Bunuel to American movies of the 1950's and 60's: Doris Day-Rock Hudson comedies, Douglas Sirk melodramas. ''Bad Education,'' with its labyrinth-like construction and doomed characters, was inspired, Almod 00f3var explained, by noirish movies like ''Laura'' and ''Out of the Past,'' and the lead actor in the film, the young Mexican star Gael Garc 00eda Bernal, is, to Almod 00f3var's mind, a great femme fatale like Barbara Stanwyck or Veronica Lake: beautiful and deadly.  At the dark heart of ''Bad Education'' is the sexual molestation of a young boy by a priest. The incident, which is depicted with grace and sadness, triggers a series of events that unfold over decades. The abused boy grows up to be a drug-addicted, would-be (but ill-fated) transsexual writer. His younger brother, an actor, hopes to sell a film director on the idea of making a movie about his brother's relationship with the pedophile priest. As the plot unfolds, fact intersects with fiction, identities shift and emotional bargains are negotiated at great psychological cost. Bernal plays no fewer than three interlocking characters. Like Almod 00f3var's previous two films, ''All About My Mother'' (which won the Best Foreign Film Oscar in 2000) and ''Talk to Her'' (which won an Academy Award for best screenplay in 2003), ''Bad Education'' is filled with beautiful and startling imagery: a child's face is split by a drop of blood; a young boy sings a version of ''Moon River'' (Holly Golightly's song in ''Breakfast at Tiffany's'') in a moment of reverie. But the movie, which will be shown as the New York Film Festival's centerpiece entry on Oct. 9 and 10 and is scheduled to open theatrically in New York and Los Angeles in November, is ultimately more concerned with redemption than with beauty -- which may be its most transgressive aspect. Summary: Pedro Almod 00f3var has sanctified society's transgressors, rescued Spanish surrealism and liberated international cinema.",

            "input": "text:As work crews fan out across Neverland Ranch, the sprawling,2,600-acre property that once was Michael Jackson's home, speculation is soaring that the estate could soon become  Foreverland   2014 a Graceland-style permanent memorial to the King of Pop.  A  person familiar with the situation  told the Associated Press Wednesday that billionaire Thomas Barrack, CEO of the private equity firm that owns Neverland in a joint venture with Jackson, sought an exemption to bury the singer at the ranch  2014 but it's a complicated process that couldn't be done in time for a burial this week.  And now, the family of Michael Jackson has released an official statement on the rumors regarding an alleged public memorial to be held at Neverland.   Contrary to previous news reports, the Jackson family is officially stating that there will be no public or private viewing at Neverland. Plans are underway regarding a public memorial for Michael Jackson, and we will announce those plans shortly.   PHOTOS: Five famous celebrity death memorial destinations.  Officials from the California Highway Patrol, meanwhile, confirmed that a meeting took place on Tuesday with several members of Jackson's family to discuss plans regarding funeral services. The same source told the AP that no public memorial is being planned at Neverland and that Jackson's funeral and burial will more likely take place in Los Angeles.  But activity has increased noticeably at Neverland, in the hills of Santa Barbara County, 120 miles north of Los Angeles, with reports of more than a dozen vehicles and groups of gardeners spotted on the property. Despite reports that a service at Neverland has fizzled, a state official told FOX News that preparations are underway since thousands are expected to come to area this weekend, making it very congested.   There's no place for a bus to turn around, and in some places, it couldn't pull over to even allow a car to pass in the other direction,  said the official who requested anonymity.  Six days after Jackson's sudden death, the arrival of construction crews and even tour buses at Neverland are fueling rumors that Jackson's family plans to make it a memorial to the King of Pop similar to Graceland, the white-columned Memphis, Tenn., estate of Elvis Presley, the King of Rock 'n' Roll.  Owen Blicksilver, a spokesman for Colony Capital, which purchased an estimated $24 million outstanding loan on Neverland in May 2008, told FOXNews.com in an e-mail that  no decisions have been made  about the future of the property.  In 1987, Jackson purchased the property, named Sycamore Valley Ranch at the time, for a reported $19.5 million. He renamed it Neverland Ranch, after the fictional land of Peter Pan. The sprawling estate once featured amusement-park rides, a zoo and two independent railway lines. It reportedly cost up to $10 million a year to maintain.  It's unclear whether Jackson can be buried at the ranch. According to The Associated Press, California's health and safety code makes interring uncremated remains outside of a cemetery a misdemeanor. Cremated remains, meanwhile, can be kept only in a home or private mausoleum outside a cemetery.  Barrack called Neverland a  mythical sanctuary to Michael  shortly after the entertainer's death, and many industry insiders feel Jackson's legacy would draw huge crowds to the property, perhaps eclipsing the 600,000 tourists who flock to Graceland every year.   Neverland could be an amazing experience, because that was Michael Jackson's vision from the ground up,  said Roger Brooks, CEO of Destination Development International, a tourism consulting firm.   It was really his dream. Granted, Neverland is clouded by accusations and some of the negativity surrounding Jackson, but at the end of the day, it embodies Jackson the way he wanted to be seen.   Brooks said the biggest hurdles in transforming the ranch into a tourism behemoth would be local traffic and the approval of neighbors.   That could be a problem, it's a very residential area,  Brooks said.   But if some place was going to say, 'Hey, that's Michael Jackson,' it just makes sense it would be Neverland  2026 It would be as big as Graceland, if not bigger.   Jackson's worldwide appeal is another factor that could lead to huge dividends if a permanent memorial were to be constructed at the site.   It would be a major draw,  Brooks said.  I think that Michael Jackson is even a bigger star than Elvis. If anything, he's just as big a star. He's the Elvis of our time.    Maybe it'll happen for Michael, but Elvis was never accused of sleeping with kids,  entertainment attorney Steve Gordon told FOXNews.com.  If you have kids, would you feel comfortable going to Neverland Ranch?   Gordon said Jackson's popularity in the U.S.  2014 particularly when compared to Jackson's appeal in Europe  2014 never recovered following his acquittal in 2005 on charges that he had molested a 13-year-old boy at the property. Jackson's lasting image in that regard remains to be seen, he said.   These wild waters have to settle before we find out what the legacy of Michael Jackson will be,  Gordon continued.  Maybe they should open up a Neverland Ranch in London.

            "input": "text:Barry Hughes: Metastatic. Photograph: Barry W Hughes   The internet is essentially stupid,  declared J 00f6rg Colberg this week. Colberg's photography site Conscientious is one of the key places to find out about new photography online, so there were an audible intake of breath as he said it. He delivered a manifesto for change at this year's PhotoIreland festival, describing the internet as a great adventure, but one that still exists for many as  a drive-by culture .  Colberg took on the ethics of online ownership, the difficulty of finding rigorous thinking and writing about photography, and the impossibility of making sense of the overload of digital images now floating in cyberspace  2013 90 million a day on Instagram alone. He said the web requires all of us not just to be aware of the misuse of images and the cavalier attitude to ownership, but to actively intervene each time we spotted the same.  It was one of the most provocative talks in the opening programme of PhotoIreland in Dublin. And in a deft bit of programming by director  00c1ngel Luis Gonz 00e1lez, Colberg was followed by Andy Adams, the man behind FlakPhoto.com and a champion of all things online. He had me onside mostly, talking about the possibilities of the web for sharing, marketing and discussing photography  2013 but the questions posed by Colberg undercut the all-round positivity of his presentation. Quoting from Jason Evans's essay Online Photographic Thinking, Adams insisted the web offered a new way of thinking both for photographers and their public. He name-checked Marshall McLuhan's essay, The Medium is the Message but not The Medium is the Massage, the cult book which suggested that new mediums lull us into passivity rather than make us more aware.  Elsewhere at the festival I hosted a conversation with photographer Cristina de Middel on life before and after The Afronauts, her phenomenally successful self-published photo book. She gave the audience a tantalising glimpse of her new project, a mischievous take on Chairman Mao's Little Red Book. De Middel said she was more influenced by comics and films than photography books. She also said photography had not yet discovered its ability to tell stories and create fictions, which is her aim as an artist. De Middel also regaled us with tales of how certain intrepid photobook collectors tracked her down and turned up on her doorstep offering wads of cash for a copy of The Afronauts  2013 a book that now changes hands for 00a31,200.  On a quick tour of the exhibitions, I was taken by Shane Lynam's Contours, which  creates a fictional greenbelt around the city  that suggests the original optimistic vision behind the planning of Parisian suburbs. Linda Brownlee's series, Achill, conjures the stillness of the island in County Mayo and the singular sense of belonging felt by local teenagers. Barry Hughes offers a very different take on landscape with his project Metastatic, a conceptual exploration of environment and dread though an old John Wayne film, The Conqueror. It was shot in Snow Canyon State Park in Utah, close to a nuclear test site. (The fact that the director Dick Powell, stars and 91 crew members later died of cancer led some to believe that nuclear fallout was the cause.) Hughed gives an interesting visual meditation on anxiety and contamination.  Landscape loomed large at PhotoIreland. Kevin Griffin's Omey Island  2013 Last Man Standing centred on Pascal Whelen, the last resident of the the tiny island of Omey off the coast of Galway, while Robert Ellis's New Line looked at the space inhabited by an alternative community in the west of Ireland.  A word, too, for Paul Gaffney's palpably silent landscapes, We Make the Path by Walking, which reflect his state of mind while travelling 3,500 kilometres on foot through rural Spain, Portugal and France. Muted colours add to the Sebaldian mystery of crossroads, thickets and open fields.  Dublin-based photographer Yvette Monahan took a well-deserved Portfiolio Award for her series The Time of Dreaming the World Awake. Monahan describes her images of Bugarach, a so-called magic mountain in the south of France, as  a portrait of place, a landscape of possibility . It was here, according to esoteric readings of Mayan prophecies, that a new Arcadia would arise following the end of the world on 21 December 2012. The mountain drew apocalyptic believers from all over, and must have been a nexus of disappointmentwhen 21 December came and went.  Despite this,  Monahan notes,  I realised how attractive it was to believe in the possibility of an idyll, even if it only existed in my mind.  Her photographs illuminate that idyll, and are a testament to a peculiar kind of collective wishful thinking that holds sway in our age of anxiety.  Peckham in south London is the venue for this weekend's Copeland Book Market which brings together 46 small independent publishers dealing in photography and art.

            "input": "text:The Elgin Marbles from the Parthenon on display at the British Museum. Photograph: Martin Argles Guardian  Best-read lists on websites are disconcertingly revealing things. In a week where the Guardian's list might have been dominated by, say, Michael Jackson's demise or the demonstrations in Iran, one small element of our arts coverage persistently ranked in the top-two best-read pieces on the site: a poll that asked, simply,  Is it time to return the Parthenon marbles?  No fewer than 380,000 people clicked on it, and an unprecedented 129,974 felt strongly enough to vote - an overwhelming 94.8% voting yes, and a puny 5.2% voting no.  Now, the Parthenon marbles aren't exactly breaking news: Lord Elgin began removing them from Greece in 1801. True, the new Parthenon museum had just opened, with its pointed gaps where the missing marbles ought to go - but still. The opening of even the snazziest of museums can't usually compete with one of the biggest celebrity exits in the obituaries calendar. Or the biggest demonstration in Iran since the fall of the Shah.  In short, it went viral. It appeared on Flickr, on digg, on twitpic (a picture-sharing version of Twitter), on Greek tourist websites, on a Christian forum and on dedicated Elginist sites such as Elginism.com. Some 6,000 page views were generated by the passing on of just one email link. But by far the largest number - 40,000 - came from Facebook, where various campaigns steered viewers towards doing the right thing.  Most respondents were, unsurprisingly, Greek: Greece usually accounts for 0.4% of the Guardian's monthly traffic, but more than half of respondents to the poll were from Athens (second place went to London, at 6%. That's how much we care). The Athenian respondents felt so strongly about exercising their democratic rights that they visited the page an average of twice each. They did invent the concept, after all. Summary: Guardian poll on whether to return the art treasure got 129,974 responses",

Photograph: David Levene  The National Gallery and the Louvre have announced perhaps their most important collaboration ever, agreeing to lend each other one of their most important paintings with the aim, they say, of illuminating Leonardo da Vinci's painting career as never before.  Neither of the works has been lent before and, in all likelihood, never will be again.  The Louvre will send its version of Leonardo's Virgin of the Rocks across the Channel so it can hang alongside the London version for the first time. It will be part of the National Gallery's major Leonardo show in November.  In return, London will lend The Burlington House Cartoon  2013 Virgin and Child with Saint Anne and John the Baptist so it can hang alongside the newly cleaned and restored Paris version, The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne.  Nicholas Penny, director of the National Gallery, called it an  extraordinary collaboration  and said they were  delighted and very grateful . He added:  I am quite sure that the experience of seeing these masterpieces juxtaposed will be one that none of us will ever forget or that will ever be repeated. I am delighted that such a rich context for these comparisons will be provided at each venue.   His counterpart at the Louvre, Henri Loyrette, said it achieved two  historical juxtapositions long desired by generations of art historians and which are certain to offer a source of considerable fascination for today's museum visitors as well .  Uniting the Virgins will cast light on what was going on in Leonardo's mind in terms of his artistic ambition and aims.  The Louvre version is the first, commissioned by the Milanese Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception for its new chapel at San Francesco Grande around 1482 3. The Louvre painting would have been the central panel of the altarpiece, if a row over the price had not led to it being sold to a third party.  It is an extraordinary painting. In terms of the landscape, nothing quite like it had been painted before.  The London version is the intended replacement. For a long time it was thought to be more the work of assistants than Leonardo until recent research proved it was mostly or even entirely the work of the painter himself.  The loans will provide a highlight for what was always going to be a major, once-only exhibition. The National Gallery exhibition brings together the largest ever number of paintings from Leonardo's career in Milan and includes the loan of the Saint Jerome from the Vatican and The Lady with an Ermine from Krakow. As things stand, there will be nine.  Organisers have already said they will restrict visitor numbers in order to make the experience as pleasurable as possible.  The announcement is also some good news for the National Gallery after a vandal sprayed red aerosol paint on one of its Poussin's. It raised questions about whether galleries would want to lend their Leonardo's but a gallery spokeswoman said all the paintings were still coming to London.

A Francesco Guardi painting of the Rialto Bridge and a busy Grand Canal under a dramatic and luminous blue sky has had a temporary export bar placed on it by the arts minister, Ed Vaizey.  The work set an auction record for a painting of Venice when it was sold in July for  00a326.7m to an anonymous bidder at Sotheby's in London.  Before that the painting  2013 Venice, a View of the Rialto Bridge, Looking North, from the Fondamenta del Carbon  2013 had been passed down through various members of the Guinness family including, recently, a former arts minister, the late Paul Channon.  It is regarded as an extremely important example of Guardi's work. The export bar allows time for someone to come up with the money to keep the painting in Britain.  The work certainly has a wow factor. Simon Swynfen Jervis, who sits on the reviewing committee which decides on export licences for such important works, said:  This noble painting represents Francesco Guardi on a grand scale, emulating Canaletto and Bellotto.   Whether it was patterns of patronage or his own inclination which later impelled him towards a smaller scale and lighter touch, this View of the Rialto demonstrates that in 1768 he could impress as well as delight.   The reviewing committee decided that the export decision should be deferred because of the  outstanding aesthetic importance  of the work together with its significance to the study of Guardi's development, Venetian view painting and Grand Tour patronage and taste.  The price the painting fetched at Sotheby's in the summer surpassed its pre-sale estimate of  00a315m- 00a325m. Before then it had been sold only once. It was first acquired in 1768 by a young English grand tourist called Chaloner Arcedeckne and it stayed in his family until it was sold to Sir Edward Guinness, the chief executive and then chairman of the brewing company.

            "input": "text:But, only three weeks after his family signed up, the incentives program closed to new applicants. The program was controversial in part because all residents had to pay for it through a levy on electricity bills, whether they were solar users or not  2014 a figure that could add up to around AUD$100 ($93) per year. A similar controversy has risen over generous benefits in Germany.  As prices for solar panels have fallen worldwide to around 50 cents per watt in countries like the United States, and controversies over who benefits have come to the forefront, other regions in Australia as well as countries like Germany and Italy have pulled back on their solar energy incentive programs.  But the picture for solar hopefuls isn't entirely cloudy. If you 2019re thinking of converting to solar, some governments continue to offer programs to reduce the cost  2014 albeit less generous ones  2014 and some companies offer leasing programs to pay off the units long-term.  Part of the rationale for reducing the benefits is that prices for residential solar power systems have dropped dramatically, with the cost of production for solar hours decreasing 80% over the last four years.  Darren Gladman, policy manager for the Melbourne-based Clean Energy Council, said in October the average price was AUD$3,567 ($3,327) for a 1.5-kilowatt system, the typical size needed to power a small, two-person home. Four years ago, the same 1.5-kilowat system might have cost up to AUD$30,000 ($27,996), making it necessary for the government to both give rebates of about AUD$8,000 ($7,466) to make the purchase of the system more affordable and to institute the levy, or tariff, for all residents.  Falling prices didn 2019t just reduce the lucrative incentives for people to equip their homes with solar panels. The price slump also has driven many solar panel companies out of business, including American company Solyndra in September 2011. Despite receiving $535m in federal loan guarantees from the US Energy Department, the company closed. In Germany, Q-Cells, Solon and Conergy have all filed for insolvency.  Gladman, however, said this solar slump applies mainly to manufacturers, not installers like those in Australia that import products. For solar-energy hopefuls, that means there 2019s more competition 2014and better pricing 2014for installing systems. And with many governments still offering incentives for solar use, it could still be worthwhile to examine whether solar is a good 2014and cost-saving 2014alternative.  A Lease on Solar Life  Brokerage companies like Solar Choice make it easy to find an installer that meets the needs of different homeowners. They provide information on company ratings and comparison price quotes. In Australia, there are approximately 4,500 solar installation companies. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, there are 6,100 solar businesses in the US.  And others are entering the market. California-based solar giant SunPower plans to launch a leasing program in Australia in January 2014, the company 2019s chief executive Tom Werner said. This will allow consumers to purchase solar systems with no up-front cost in the form of a long-term repayable loan of up to $35,000. Ostensibly, the loan is repaid monthly using the money saved on energy bills.  In the US, SunPower currently has 20,000 customers on a similar leasing program, Werner said.  Most federal energy departments and environmental councils offer free online solar guides on topics like energy audits, local codes for installation and available incentive program applications.  Programs that subsidize green energy tend to spark debate over how much and whether to subsidize. Generous benefits over the last five years helped spur the installation of in-home solar power systems, but at great cost. For instance, Down Under, their number has grown to one million today from 8,000 households in 2007. But the program cost the government more than AUD$1 bn ($933.2m).   201c(Solar) is an expensive way to make electricity and that 2019s the problem at the moment, 201d Ford said.  201cAs price continues to decrease, it makes green energy a more attractive option. 201d  Follow BBC Capital on Twitter @BBC_Capital or follow us and join the conversation about this or any other Capital story on Facebook: BBC Capital on Facebook.

            "input": "text:Justin Bieber's night of drinking and drag racing in Miami ended in charges of drunken driving and resisting arrest.  As Sabrina Cohen knows all too well, it could have been much, much worse.  In 1992 Cohen, then 14, hopped into the backseat of her friend's car on Miami Beach. She thought she was going to a party, but the driver had other plans. He started drag racing on Alton Road and crashed into a tree around Alton and 58th Street. While the other passengers sustained minor injuries, the impact of the crash shattered Cohen's spine and paralyzed her legs.   I understand the consequences of what comes with having too much fun,  Cohen,36, tells ThePostGame,  Or just thinking you can do anything.   Bieber was arrested early Thursday morning at Pine Tree Drive and 27th Street. That's just minutes from the spot where Cohen's accident took place on Halloween in 1992. It's one of the city's prettiest streets, but also one of the most curvaceous.   You could take your car for a little bit more of a ride as opposed to just driving straight,  Cohen says about Pine Tree Drive, which becomes Alton Road.  In the wake of Bieber's arrest, Cohen says it's easy to ignore the story or blame the incident on Bieber's youth. But Cohen says Bieber's troubles should serve as a lesson. Often teenagers know the right decision in their gut but are pressured to do something else by friends or society, she says. Cohen, for example, wasn't wearing a seat belt when she hopped in that car because she didn't want to seem out of place.  Teenagers should be trusted to make the correct call, Cohen believes, because they have the capability to make proper judgements in situations like these.   If they're in a bad situation or feeling pressure, [I'd say] to just trust themselves and be concerned with their own safety rather than looking good around other people,  she says.  Cohen has traveled across the country educating young people on the dangers of reckless driving. She's also started the Sabrina Cohen Foundation For Stem Cell Research, which has raised $150,000 to date.  Cohen's newest project is a rehab and fitness center in Miami Beach that caters to people who are suffering from medical conditions. She hopes it will allow disabled men and women to get involved in sports and other physical activities.   We might do it a little differently,  Cohen says,  But that doesn 2019t mean we have to be secluded from it.   Obviously there are several key distinctions between Bieber's incident and other drag racing stories -- Bieber is a global sensation, he was reportedly drinking and this is far from his first offense. Still, Cohen says this is an issue that shouldn't be ignored.   The truth is teenagers of all ages and all income levels have access to driving and partying and going out,  Cohen says.  Unfortunately it's until something happens that other people take the issue seriously.   To learn more about Sabrina Cohen or her foundation, see here.

            "input": "text:The Winter Olympic program has never been a static thing. Many events have come and gone since the first Winter Games were held in 1924 in Chamonix, France. At least one sport, curling, has even come, then gone, then come back onto the Olympic roster.  It was the introduction of snowboarding, though, during the 1998 Nagano Olympics that really launched current round of growth in the Winter Olympic program. Ten new events were added to the 2002 Salt Lake City program, eight new events debuted in the 2006 Turin Olympics, and one (ski cross) in Vancouver in 2010.  And while most these additions had little to do with snowboarding, in many cases they reflected the same tendency to appeal to a younger, more action-oriented audience than in Olympics past. New events like team pursuit speed skating, ski cross and sprint distances in otherwise yawn-worthy cross country skiing -- to many TV viewers, anyway -- were an attempt to inject old sports with new energy.  But even compared with the recent past, 2014 in Sochi is going to be a bumper year for medals. A total of 98 events will be contested -- the most of any Winter Olympics in history -- and 12 of those are new to the program. Out of those 12, four new events are in snowboarding and four are ski events -- including slopestyle and halfpipe -- originally popularized for snowboard. This is no accident.   201cSuch events provide great entertainment for the spectators and add further youthful appeal to our already action-packed lineup of Olympic winter sports, 201d said IOC president Jacques Rogge when announcing the new events 2019 inclusion in July 2011.  In short, the IOC took a look at the popularity of the Winter X Games and took the hint.  This Winter X Games staple has skiers performing tricks on a course packed with features like ramps, rails and other jibs -- essentially a  skate park on snow,  in the words of Sochi hopeful Tom Wallisch. Skiers are scored on the following criteria: the execution and style of their moves, the difficulty and risk of their program, variety, amplitude and progression.  X Games champ Nick Goepper, only 19, will be the one to watch in the men 2019s event, having clinched his Olympic berth in just the second of five qualifying events. On the women's side, freeskier Devin Logan,20, has a good shot at medaling in both ski slopestyle and ski halfpipe.  In this timed mixed-gender event, each team comprises women's and men's singles sleds and a doubles sled, according to the U.S. Luge Association. All the sleds begin at the same starting point, but follow each other in sequence -- with the gates opening up for each sled after the previous sledder in the team reaches the end of the course and touches a pad overhanging the track. The U.S. relay team will be selected from those lugers with the best individual and doubles performances during the Olympics.  This event will take place on the same 635-meter course that 2019s being used for ski slopestyle, which includes three jib areas and three jumps. Two-time halfpipe gold medalist Shaun White is hoping to add a slopestyle medal to his Olympic trophy case -- if he makes the team. Although he dominated the event in the Winter X Games from 2003 to 2006, White hasn't medaled in slopestyle since 2009 in either the X Games or the Winter Dew Tour.  Snowboarders race to the finish line down parallel slalom courses with triangular flags in this new Olympic event. A more tightly spaced -- and hence more technical -- version of the equivalent giant slalom event, introduced to the Olympic program in 2002, this tournament-style competition will have boarders going head to head, beginning with a round of sixteen. Each matchup will consist of two runs, with boarders switching courses for the second run to cancel out any variation in the courses.  Like snowboard halfpipe -- a signature board event that 2019s been in the Olympics since 1998 -- the skiing version of this event involves doing tricks and aerials on a sloped pipe that's 180 meters long, 20 meters wide and 7 meters deep, according to the International Ski Federation. Performing tricks with names like  alley-oop flatspin 540 critical  and  switch leftside 720 Japan,  skiers are judged on execution, difficulty, amplitude, variety and progression -- a measure of new and uncommon tricks or variations. Keep an eye out for freeskiers Maddie Bowman in the women 2019s event and David Wise in the men's, both of whom recently clinched a spot on the Olympic roster and are reigning X Games champs.  The inclusion of this event in the Winter Olympics was a long time coming for elite female ski jumpers, who had lobbied for its addition for more than a decade before it finally made it into the list in April 2011. Female jumpers had been told in the past that the event was medically inappropriate for women, according to non-profit Women's Ski Jumping USA. Until now, ski jumping was the only event -- besides Nordic combined, which includes cross country skiing and ski jumping -- not to allow women to participate in the Winter or Summer Games, according to the organization. The 19-year-old phenom Sarah Hendrickson, sidelined by an injury in August, will be the one to watch if she recovers in time to make the team. Another top contender is Lindsey Van, who won the event's first-ever gold at the 2009 world championships.  Biathlon -- a mixture of cross-country skiing and marksmanship 2014has roots in winter military warfare, according to the U.S. Biathlon team website. In the mixed relay event, a team of two women and two men race in sequence, making transitions in a handover zone. The women complete the first two legs on a 6km course and the two men finish on a 7.5km course. Each biathlete has two bouts of shooting -- one lying prone, and one standing, and must hit all five targets or else do a penalty loop for each target missed. The sport is typically dominated by Germany, Northern European countries, and former Soviet republics.  Like the gymnastics team competition, this event provides an opportunity for participating countries to show off their prowess in a single sport across disciplines 2014and genders. Each team has one male skater, one female skater, one skating pair and one ice dance couple. Points are awarded according to placement in each discipline 2014one point for 10th place and 10 points for first -- and tallied at the end; the highest score wins. The event made its quasi-Olympic debut in 2012 at the Winter Youth Olympic Games in Innsbruck, Austria. The U.S. is expected to be a strong contender for the gold with world-champion ice dancing duo Meryl Davis and Charlie White (pictured) likely to be on the team.

The Boston-born pop quartet will release its new  201cBad Self Portraits 201d on the Northampton-based Signature Sounds label onFeb. 18, and will then play a sold-out show at the Sinclair in Cambridge on Feb. 21. This all follows the group 2019s TV debut this month on  201cThe Colbert Report 201d and, back in September, a critically lauded performance in the  201cAnother Day, Another Time 201d concert at The Town Hall in New York to promote the Coen Brothers 2019 new film,  201cInside Llewyn Davis. 201d A film of the concert is now playing on the Showtime cable network.  But the biggest spur to the 10-year-old band 2019s current surge  2014 including all of the above and more sold-out shows that extend into the next three months, with another in Boston, at Royale, on April 6  2014 has been a YouTube video of Lake Street Dive 2019s on-the-street performance of the Jackson 5 2019s  201cI Want You Back. 201d The clip has gone viral, with more than 1.4 million views.  Like every  201covernight success, 201d this one has been slow in coming. They convened as undergraduates at New England Conservatory in spring 2004, knowing they wanted to make music together but not quite sure what that should be. Earnest jazz students wanting to push the envelope, they considered combining country music and free improvisation. Eventually, traveling on the road together, they gravitated toward the music of artists they all enjoyed listening to  2014 Stevie Wonder, Paul Simon, Bob Dylan. Perhaps this accounts for their singular blend of Motown, British Invasion, and other strands of pop, jazz, and R&B.  It 2019s not hard to see Lake Street Dive 2019s appeal in that  201cI Want You Back 201d video. Shot on a street in Brighton, bathed in white-hot sunlight, the band takes a slow turn through the Jackson 5 hit  2014 Bridget Kearney laying down a languid statement of the melody on her stand-up bass; drummer Mike Calabrese keeping the beat with brushes, snare, and cymbal; Mike  201cMcDuck 201d Olson playing soft trumpet obligattos. It 2019s breezy and casual  2014 shot with a handheld camera by their friend Greg Liszt (of the Deadly Gentlemen and Crooked Still) on the sidewalk outside his house. At the center is lead singer Rachael Price 2019s rich alto and charismatic delivery, with a touch of luscious vibrato, supported by Kearney andCalabrese 2019s spot-on backing harmonies.  Boston jazz fans have been aware of Price 2019s singing for a while. She 2019s recorded with a trio, and at clubs like Scullers you could always sense the ease with which she tore through standards, her eagerness to accelerate into the curve of the next tricky harmony or lyric.  The singer and songwriter Miss Tess has often sung with Price in the vintage swing band the Sweet and Lowdown. The two have been friends since a Craigslist ad made them roommates in 2005, when Tess moved to Boston to attend Berklee.  201cI 2019ve always known Rachael was a world-class singer, 201d says Tess, citing her friend 2019s technique and the  201cvelvety depth 201d of her voice. Upon hearing her new roommate sing, Tess says, her first thought was  201cOh, I just moved in with Sarah Vaughan. 201d  Moving out of the shadow of NEC, the band flexed their muscles as songwriters with a talent for original hooks and sharp, funny lyrics. In 2005, Kearney (who until recently also played in the neo-bluegrass band Joy Kills Sorrow), won a $5,000 John Lennon Songwriting Contest award, which also included the manufacturing cost of 1,000 CDs. That bankrolled their first album,  201c. . . in this episode, 201d which featured Kearney 2019s prize-winning song  201cSometimes When I 2019m Drunk and You 2019re Wearing My Favorite Shirt. 201d  Over the first few albums (including 2007 2019s  201cPromises, Promises 201d and their 2011 self-titled Signature Sounds debut) the band stuck mostly with the spare instrumentation of voice, trumpet, acoustic bass, and drums, with a few bits of guitar or piano. They built a loyal Boston audience at clubs like Toad and the Lizard Lounge. (All but Olson have since moved to Brooklyn, N.Y.)  Then came  201cI Want You Back. 201d Originally posted in spring 2012 as a promotional video for the band 2019s six-song covers EP  201cFun Machine, 201d the clip was getting respectable if not outrageous traffic. But in October, while the band was in the studio recording  201cBad Self Portraits, 201d  201csome nameless, faceless champion of the band, 201d as Kearney says, posted the video on Reddit. Literally overnight it scored hundreds of thousands of views. The video led to gigs.   201cWe spent all of 2013 hitting the road super hard, 201d says Kearney,  201cplaying in front of a bunch of people. One of those people in particular told T Bone Burnett. 201d Burnett, the music producer for  201cInside Llewyn Davis, 201d booked them for  201cAnother Day, Another Time. 201d  On  201cBad Self Portraits 201d you could say the Lake Street Dive 2019s songs and sound are the same, only bigger. There 2019s more guitar (thanks to Olson 2019s late adoption of the instrument), piano, and some overdubbed horns. And the group vocals in particular pop, with a diverse range of perfectly deployed  201cWoo-ooh! 2019 2019s.   201cI remember on our first albums, thinking why don 2019t these background vocals sound good? 201d says Kearney.  201cAfter some time, I realized it was that we weren 2019t singing them well. 201d The band buckled down, working on dynamics and articulation. They also benefited from the coaching of  201cBad Self Portraits 201d producer Sam Kassirer ( 201cour first full-on producer, 201d says Kearney).  For his part, Kassirer says the band surprised him with its range of reference  2014 everything from the expected jazz and soul to Beck and the Beatles. As an example he points to  201cRental Love, 201d the Beatles-esque ballad from the new album, which includes two piano tracks and two drum tracks.   201cOften there 2019s a give-and-take in bands between raw talent and trained musicianship, 201d says Kassirer.  201cThis is the first band I 2019ve worked with who have 100 percent of both. That allows for a lot of things in terms of exploring musical ideas and executing them. 201d  For now, the band is working it. A couple of nights after Colbert, they play the sold-out Narrows Center for the Arts in Fall River. They come out with all four voices blasting a five-note  201cah-ah-ah-ah-ah!, 201d setting up Price 2019s tear through the opening verse of Calabrese 2019s girl-group-style  201cStop Your Crying. 201d Throughout the set, the Motown influence is evident. At times the band sounds like a soul revue, with its own built-in backing chorus. And there again is that knack for the offbeat cover arrangement, in this case George Michael 2019s  201cFaith, 201d set to a New Orleans second-line groove.  Lake Street Dive seem to be on their way. They signed their first manager in 2012 as well as a tour manger.  201cWe 2019ve got a sound man, a nice van, 201d says Kearney.  201cThings are looking up. 201d Summary: Lake Street Dive is blowing up.

There's something terrifying about this nocturnal vision - it is every woman's nightmare of the dangers that streets might hold after dark - and yet Juan del Gado's photograph also feels fake. Like a latter-day Weegee, del Gado constructs crime-scene images that unsettle both through the violence they allude to and the artifice their lush colouring and theatrical lighting reveals.  Each of the four artists in this exhibition themed around the night creates work that blends threat, drama, enigma and terror. Rut Blees Luxemburg's photographs show cityscapes that suggest violence: streets bathed in saffron light, traversed by streams of liquid that could be blood; a deserted road innocuous by day but menacing in the dead of night. In Christopher Stewart's work, lonely figures stand on the edge of something (the Irish border, a Finnish forest), the tension of their position heightened by the darkness that surrounds them. Sophy Rickett, meanwhile, documents nocturnal scenes - a wood, an owl in flight - in ways that make them magical. What this show captures so well is the weird beauty of night vision, the fear and wonder, a fear that never really fades.   0095 Until September 1. Details: 0131-622 6200.

Guests at the private ceremony  2013 which is set to air as a special on TNT June 14  2013 included Chelsea Handler, Melanie Griffith, Felicity Huffman, Marcia Gay Harden, Rosario Dawson, activist Eve Ensler and Disney president Anne Sweeney.  Tomlin described Fonda as  an evolutionary agent for our species. She is a role model for the American modern woman,  immediately correcting herself to broaden the scope to all women.  Celebrants lauded Fonda for her political activism and dedication to gender equality, which she translated to the screen in such films as 1978's  Wanda Sykes, who wore a  costume and was carried onstage by a man dressed as a winged angel, called Fonda  my hero.   Diaz cited her as  a beautiful example of navigating a career in Hollywood.  Field admitted she's been  trying like crazy  to follow in Fonda's footsteps.  Bullock told Fonda,  you live the life so many of us dream of.  Streep, who said she still does Fonda's workout videos, described her as  a big sister [who] walked me into moviemaking.   costar Jeff Daniels feted her with his guitar, singing a song with the refrain,  abs, buns and thighs.   Peter Fonda, who wore sunglasses perhaps to hide his emotions, choked up as he said,  Nobody has dreamed bigger and nobody has worked harder than my sister, Jane.   The honoree herself got misty eyed when her son, Troy Garity, spoke from the stage.  In film, in fitness, in politics, in family, Mom, you have succeeded,  he said. The evening also included clips from Fonda's films and interviews with the actress.  Michael Douglas presented Fonda with her award, and she said she was  so happy to add another woman's name to the list.  Previous recipients of AFI's highest honor include Barbra Streisand, Morgan Freeman, Mel Brooks, Bette Davis and Fonda's father, Henry Fonda.  A resplendent Jane Fonda, who thanked Vera Wang for her custom-made black and white gown, said that as she reflects on her career and the many creative geniuses she worked with, she wishes she would have asked more questions.   Stay curious,  she said.  Stay interested. It's much more important to be interested than interesting.  Summary: Bullock, Meryl Streep, Sally Field, Lily Tomlin and Cameron Diaz were among those saluting the AFI honoree",

Three brothers from Maryland who grew up playing lacrosse 2014two of them professionally 2014have used the knowledge they have gained from the sport to start a salad dressing company. (Lettuce is lacrosse slang for long, flowing hair coming out the back of a helmet 2014no rare sight on a college lacrosse pitch.)  When the Vetter brothers were younger, their mother, Teresa Vetter, came up with a tasty lemon-garlic dressing to get the boys to eat salad.  201cThe only thing anyone asked for at our tailgates was for us to bring the dressing, 201d says Greg Vetter,31, the oldest brother.  The next logical step? In 2009, after all the Vetter men had graduated from college, Greg called his mother,  201casking if she would go into business with me if I got us into Whole Foods. She responded by saying,  2018That 2019s never going to happen.' 201d  In February 2009, Greg, armed with a Tupperware container of salad and the original lemon garlic dressing, walked into the Whole Foods WFM in Annapolis, Md. and presented his product. He had no bottling, no assembly line, no outside help. Despite this, Greg emerged with an order for his salad dressing from that single Whole Foods location.  Tessemae 2019s All Natural was born, but Greg, who soon brought in his brothers Brian and Matt, says the company would have floundered without the drive he developed as an athlete. Greg and his brothers had little business knowledge, but sports had given them the gift of an underdog mentality. The Vetters also knew what they lacked, so in November 2013, they brought in outside consultant Mike McDevitt, founder and CEO of Tandem Legal Group (but not a lawyer by trade), to help out. For $350,0, McDevitt bought an initial 3.5% ownership stake in the company (he now owns 15%).  201cThat was an investment in Greg Vetter, 201d McDevitt says. Now, with fast growth, McDevitt has high hopes.  201cI see $100 million [in sales] as a goal in the very near future. All these stores are asking for this product, but we want to make sure they fit our brand. 201d  McDevitt 2019s firm was not the only company hungry to join Tessemae 2019s, but it was the best fit. Tessemae 2019s says it has rejected other investors along the way.  201cI had to learn the Tesse way before I could improve the Tesse way, 201d McDevitt says.  The Vetters, and the company, by extension, value collaboration and teamwork. In other words, Tessemae 2019s functions a bit like a sports team:  201cThey had a big order to go out for their raspberry vinaigrette, 201d McDevitt says,  201cand they had their entire team on the [assembly] line doing everything they could. The CEOs were dipping the bottle into the wax. 201d They finished 10 minutes before their deadline; one of the brothers came over with a bucket of vinaigrette and dumped it on Greg 2019s head.  Even high-stakes lacrosse games are meant to be fun, the brothers reason; why not apply the same mentality to their business? Tessemae 2019s calls its headquarters in Essex, Md. 2014which consists of an office complex and 36,000-square-foot fully automated assembly line 2014the Tree Fort. Why? Todd Fletcher, executive VP of marketing, says,  201cBack in the day, [a tree house] is where you went to let your imagination run wild. This is your home base. It is raw, pure energy, but not in an intimidating way. It is motivating, more than anything else. 201d  Fletcher 2019s formal title, by the way, is a bit of an anomaly: Oliver Ginsburg is director of customer happiness and (self-proclaimed)  201cguru of the Internet. 201d The youngest brother, Matt, is the company 2019s  201cdoctor super chef 201d and (again, self proclaimed)  201cDr. Dre of salad dressing. 201d  The little company is thriving. It has 24 dressings and two varieties of mayonnaise, two hot sauces, a teriyaki sauce, a garlic spread, a ketchup, and a seafood marinade. Last year, only the firm 2019s fifth on the market, Tessemae 2019s brought in $4.1 million in revenue, up 342% over 2012, which was in turn up 247% over 2011 2019s $890,000.  To keep growing, the brothers will have to find more magic. Robert Goldin of food-market research firm Technomic warns that the salad dressing market  201cis very, very crowded. 201d  But Tessemae 2019s has help from a recent health kick in America. Not only are unique exercise trends exploding (see: CrossFit, American Ninja Warrior, Tough Mudder, and others), but food label trends are pointing in the healthier direction. Just look at a Tessemae 2019s bottle to see how carefully the company is aligning itself with that push: you 2019ll see terms like  201csugar free, 201d  201cgluten-free, 201d and  201ccertified Earth Kosher. 201d (EarthKosher is a company that provides Kosher certification.)  Tessemae 2019s products are gluten free and certified non-GMO. The sales of food and drink items that bear these terms, according to Nielsen, have increased in the United States over the past four years. (Sales of non-GMO products, for example, have gone up an average of 23.8% every year.) Tessemae 2019s also makes its dressing according to organic standards (those items are up an average of 13.2% over the past four years), but it does not label the products as such because doing so, the Vetters say, would lead stores to raise the prices more than the brothers would like.  Tessemae 2019s believes it will keep growing thanks to its secret weapon: the recipe originator herself, Teresa. Their mother is the company 2019s  201cofficial taste tester 201d and has absolute veto power over every new flavor. Twice now, the brothers acknowledge, they have gone against her suggestions, and both of those flavors 2014poppy-seed grapefruit and oil-free Italian 2014bombed. But if Mom was worried, she doesn 2019t let on anymore.  201cThey do it all on their own now. 201d Summary: In a crowded corner of the food industry, Tessemae's Salad Dressing is growing fast.",

Then admission charges were introduced to our flagship museums.  One of the welcome legacies of New Labour's first term in office was the abolition of those charges last year. Dozens of museums were once again opened up to the whole of the public, not just the affluent middle classes. The number of visitors to venues such as the Natural History or the Imperial War Museum, with its stunning new Holocaust installation, has consequently risen by 70 per cent.  Now the 'commercialist' tendency within the museum world - led by the Natural History - is threatening to reintroduce charges unless the Government increases further the compensation they receive for allowing free entry. Not only do they overlook the huge income stream from museum shops and caf 00e9s that new visitors bring. They also overlook the - terribly Victorian - belief that knowledge, and its acquisition, should be free to all. If the current managers of the Natural History Museum cannot guarantee access for all in return for a Government subsidy of almost  00a340 million a year, they should make way for managers who can.

It opened my eyes to modern art when I was still a child, with its unforgettable show of kinetic art, and I've been going back ever since, partly for the art, but always for the building. I love its drama and unpredictability - its hidden terraces, its spiky rooflights, its quirky one-up-one-down staircases. Together they create a mad modernist Gormenghast that somehow brings out the best in the art it celebrates.  Again and again curators find new ways to inflect its spaces to deliver something fresh, sometimes intimate and subtle, sometimes grandly theatrical. Every new exhibition is a riff on the gallery's classic journey, from the hush and concentration of the downstairs rooms to the effortless, high-ceilinged drama of the upper galleries. It's exciting and mysterious - qualities rare enough in any context but miraculous in early 1960s UK civic architecture. It's one of the great, eccentric treasures of London.

Former landscape gardener Peter Bellwood,52, of Magazine Farm Way, Prettygale, Colchester, was jailed at Swansea crown court after admitting six identical charges of theft of antique maps at a previous appearance there in October.  He had used a sharp knife to  razor  50 irreplaceable maps during six visits to the National Library of Wales over six months in 2000 and netted  00a370,000 by selling the antiques to collectors. He was so sought-after that his mug-shot was included on the Metropolitan Police's online  most wanted  list earlier this year.  Bellwood's activities remained undetected for more than a year and only came to light when the alarm was raised in Denmark, where he is wanted for numerous alleged thefts at the Royal Library in Copenhagen.  The Danish library knows that Bellwood first visited on January 29 2001 - records show he signed in under his own name. He appears to have allayed suspicion early on by handing in a 500 Kroner note, worth  00a346, which he claimed to have found  lying around .  But within two days he allegedly succeeded in razoring maps from a series of old atlases and rare 16th century Dutch travel books - a haul valued at  00a3100,000. None of the stolen items have yet been recovered.  After he was caught red-handed on its CCTV in the act of razoring rare prints, the library posted his photo on its internet site, alerting libraries across Europe to his exploits. The internet alert led the National Library of Wales to discover its own losses.  As news of the thefts flashed around the world, libraries with rare collections checked their records to see whether they had had a visit from Bellwood.  In Holland, authorities at the Royal Library discovered 55 maps missing from a variety of atlases. While it transpired that Bellwood was not the thief in their case, the man they did suspect was British and was found to have also visited Finland and Sweden.  Officials ran checks at the Royal Library in Stockholm and found that Bellwood and another UK national were both frequent visitors. They then discovered that 40 maps from at least six atlases were missing. Visits by both men were made from August 2000 to January 2001.  Despite Bellwood's criminal career being brought to a halt in Britain, and the possibility of facing criminal proceedings in Denmark, much of what he stole could be lost forever. With strong black-market demand for rare maps and prints around the world, and many illicit collectors, the chance of recovering the maps seems remote.  The court heard that a desperate Bellwood had stolen the maps to fuel a gambling addiction that was out of control. Summary: A prolific art thief who admitted stealing dozens of rare antique maps worth tens of thousands of pounds was sentenced to four and a half years in jail at Swansea crown court today.",

Here are the most important points from the fiscal first-quarter earnings report.  What you need to know: Though the profit growth was largely helped by the acquisition-related item (more on that in a minute), Starbucks also reported fairly solid sales at its stores. Same-store sales in the Americas climbed 5% while also gaining abroad from more customers. The growth was stronger than expected, analysts had expected a 4.8% in the Americas, according to a poll by Consensus Metrix. In China and Asia Pacific, same store sales increased 8%. That growth in customer traffic and sales are important as the results were for the key holiday season ending December 28.  Starbucks SBUX has been lauded for a handful of savvy moves that has kept it trendy among food and beverage aficionados. The company pushing into the high-end coffee market, adding more food to its menu, and testing sodas and alcohol in some stores  2013 all in a bid to move beyond its roots in basic coffee. Analysts mostly praise these moves, saying they see a clear path for Starbucks to continue growing revenue from existing stores. One notable blip, however, was the announcement earlier this month that Chief Operating Officer Troy Alstead, who previously served as CFO, was taking an unpaid leave of absence beginning in March. JPMorgan called that news a  201csurprise 201d to Wall Street, especially after Alstead played a high profile role in the company 2019s analyst day presentation in December.  The big number: The coffee company 2019s profits were lifted by a $390.6 million gain related to the acquisition of Starbucks Japan that the company didn 2019t already own. But even excluding that gain and other items, adjusted profit climbed 16% to 80 cents a share. That 2019s right on the money with what Starbucks had predicted last year when it saw earnings between 79 cents to 81 cents. Total revenue exceeded expectations, climbing 13% to more than $4.8 billion.  What you might have missed: Starbucks 2019 outlook for the second quarter was a little lighter than expected, with adjusted profit between 64 cents to 65 cents a share versus the 68 cents that analysts expected.  Starbucks also showed some promise from its early push into mobile payments. The coffee company said its shoppers loaded a record $1.6 billion on Starbucks cards during the quarter, a huge 17% jump from last year. That indicates that the company 2019s investments in mobile have paid off, and it is showing up in sales. Transactions at comparable stores were up 2% for Starbucks-owned stores opened at least 13 months.

A big reason for the rather expensive acquisition is to gain access to the company 2019s biosimilar portfolio, a relatively new and burgeoning part of the pharma industry.  If you live in the U.S., there 2019s probably a good reason you haven 2019t heard of biosimilars. They don 2019t actually exist on American shores, yet. But they are gaining steam overseas and could account for $4.8 billion in European sales this year, according to estimates by FirstWord. Drug makers are hoping to bring them to the U.S. market, where sales would likely be even higher.  Biosimilars are less costly imitations of drugs known as biologics, which are used to treat a range of diseases including cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, and anemia. But they are different from generics in that they are not exact copies.   201cIf creating a generic drug is like designing a tricycle, then a biosimilar is like building a spaceship, in terms of complexity and size, 201d said Asthika Goonewardene, a senior healthcare analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence.  Biologic drugs are made using living cells that treat disease, usually by genetically modifying cells. They are big and very complex molecules, often 200 to 1,000 times the size of more common small-molecule drugs. For example, aspirin, part of a common category of medicine known as small-molecule drugs, is made of up only 21 atoms. While the biologic drug Enbrel, which is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and plaque psoriasis, consists of more than 20,000 atoms.  As a result of their complex makeup, biologics are highly sensitive to manufacturing and handling conditions, and many of those production details are highly-guarded intellectual property of the company that develops the initial drug. Creating imitations is, therefore, very difficult.  Producing generic small-molecule drugs is relatively simple 2013it 2019s like following a recipe with standard ingredients. Biosimilars are much more challenging because living cells are highly sensitive to their environments, and manufacturers have to create their own, unique process to coax these cells to produce an identical outcome to an existing treatment.  Biosimilars could be compared to snowflakes. The molecular makeup of each biosimilar treatment will look unique, like individual snowflakes, even though they all have similar outcomes. This is the result of differing manufacturing processes.  That makes drug approvals challenging. Generics are approved based on matching chemical structure, but that doesn 2019t work for biosimilars. Each new biosimilar has to run clinical trials to prove the outcome matches that of the biologic its imitating even though it looks structurally different, according to recently announced guidelines from the Food and Drug Administration.   201cWe 2019re still in the very nascent stages of the biosimilar story, 201d said Goonewardene.  201cIt 2019s in a state of flux right now, and that 2019s why it 2019s interesting. 201d  The opportunities for biosimilars are huge for both manufacturers and consumers. Many leading biologic medicines, worth more than $81 billion global annual sales, will lose their patent protections by 2020, according to data from Visiongain.  Much like generics, biosimilars can help cut drug costs, though the savings are smaller because of their complexity as well as regulatory challenges of getting FDA approvals. Biosimilars cost about $75 million to $250 million to reach the approval stage, versus around $2 million to $3 million for a generic small-molecule medicine, according to biologics-maker Sandoz, a Novartis company.  The United States may reap the benefits of biosimilars sooner rather than later. Last month, the FDA 2019s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee recommended Sandoz 2019s biosimilar filgrastim for approval. It 2019s a stand-in for Amgen 2019s AMGN Neupogen, which is used to boost immunity for patients undergoing chemotherapy. Sandoz 2019s biosimilar, to be marketed under the name Zarxio, could receive the FDA 2019s seal of approval as soon as this year. Summary: Biosimilars are capturing big pharma's attention. You should pay attention to them too.",

A 10cm-high wave has hit the shore in northeastern Japan this morning after a magnitude 6.8 quake prompted a tsunami warning.  The tremor struck at 8.06 am in the Pacific, some 210km east of Miyako at a depth of 10km.  There were no immediate reports of injuries or casualties following the quake and minor tsunami, local media said.  It was earlier reported that the quake was a magnitude 6.9 but this was later revised.  Local authorities in Iwate issued evacuation advisories to more than 19,000 people after the quake, Japan's public broadcaster NHK said.  There was no damage to any of nuclear reactors in the region as they have been off-line since 2011, NHK said.  Large areas of the coastline covered by the advisory were damaged by the 2011 quake and tsunami that killed more than 18,000 people and triggered a nuclear accident in Fukushima.

Yesterday, a data firm got hold of Twitter 2019s TWTR first-quarter earnings report about an hour before its official release, and the bad news about Twitter, the company, leaked 2014on Twitter, the platform.  But by the end of the day, the early release was the least of Twitter 2019s problems. The company 2019s quarterly revenue of $436 million represented 74% growth over last year, but was significantly lower than the $457 million expected by analysts, and below Twitter 2019s own guidance of a $440 to $450 million range. Twitter has now lowered its guidance for 2015 annual revenue from $2.3 billion down to the range of $2.170  2014 $2.2 billion.  The bad news naturally led to a stock slip on Tuesday  2014 actually, more like a crash. Twitter 2019s share price dropped from $48.73, at 3:26 p.m., down to $40.31 only 20 minutes later. It closed the day back up just a touch, at $42.27. In the process, Twitter 2019s cofounders lost a great deal of their wealth, at least on paper. Ev Williams, who owns 7.5% of the company, lost nearly $525 million, according to Bloomberg. Jack Dorsey, whose stake is just under 5% and who now runs Square, lost some $220 million.  In a conversation with Bloomberg, Williams said he is still bullish on the company 2019s stock.

The FTC says that donors were told in telemarking calls and mail solicitations that money would be used for medicine and transporting patients to chemotherapy, according to the Associated Press. Instead, the money was allegedly spent on personal indulgences, like gym memberships, luxury cruises and online dating site subscriptions.

            "input": "text:LOS ANGELES, May 10 2014 Charles E. Hurwitz, chairman and chief executive officer of MCO Holdings Inc., an expanding oil and gas company, appeared today to have outmaneuvered Cook International Inc. in taking control of the Simplicity Pattern Company.  Two companies controlled by Mr. Hurwitz - MCO and the Federated Development Company - announced that they had agreed to acquire 33 percent of Simplicity's stock for $48 million in separate transactions with the ailing NCC Energy Ltd. of London and a major NCC investor, Waltons Bonds Ltd. of New South Wales, Australia.  According to the MCO announcement, Mr. Hurwitz also replaced Graham Ferguson Lacey, chairman of NCC, as chairman and chief executive officer of Simplicity. Confirmation of this could not be obtained; Harold Cooper, Simplicity's vice chairman and chief operating officer, did not return phone calls, Previous Transactions  Last week Cook International increased its ownership in NCC to 48 percent of the company's ordinary shares, the British equivalent of common shares, from 11 percent. That, in turn, appeared to give Cook power over Simplicity's business operations. Joseph W. McCleary, Cook's president, indicated in a published report that he was considering removing Mr. Lacey from his NCC post.  But now NCC is selling its entire Simplicity holding to the Hurwitz group. By gaining a large stake in Simplicity, Mr. Hurwitz adds his name to a long list of investors who have been attracted to the country's leading maker of sewing patterns during the last two years. Most, however, have eventually departed.  They included the Devon Group Ltd., an investment company controlled by the family of John L. Loeb Sr., the Wall Street financier; Victor Posner, chairman of the Sharon Steel Corporation and investor in several public companies, and Carl Icahn, a Wall Street arbitrager. Seen as Merger Candidate  The sewing pattern business has reached a plateau as more women have joined the work force outside the home, but Simplicity has been considered a potential merger candidate because of its balance sheet. The company has a relatively large amount of cash and no longterm debt.  Simplicity, with headquarters in New York, reported that it had $82.9 million of cash on hand on Jan. 31,1981, the latest figure available. Adding short-term securities, accounts receivable and inventories, which together with cash constitute current assets, the total was more than eight times the amount of current liabilities.  Most retailing companies average about twice as much cash and other current assets as current liabilities, which consist of bills coming due. That relationship, commonly known as the current ratio, is a benchmark for assessing financial strength. When the ratio climbs higher than 4 to 1, analysts regard it as a sign of stagnant management. Simplicity, long criticized for not using its money to diversify into more promising markets, said earlier this year that it was planning some oil and gas acquisitions in the United States and mineral and energy investments in Australia. Details of Purchases  Those would likely have been through NCC Energy and its Australian partner, Waltons Bonds. In March, however, Simplicity said it was delaying its planned merger with NCC.  According to MCO, it and Federated will acquire 2.75 million Simplicity common shares, or 20 percent, at $10.50 a share from NCC Energy. ''It is anticipated that MCO will ultimately acquire'' Federated's share of the purchase, the company said.  In addition, MCO said it would acquire 1,826,100 Simplicity common shares, or an additional 13 percent, from Waltons Bonds, also for $10.50 a share. Simplicity's stock, traded on the New York Stock Exchange, closed today at 8 5 8, down 7 8.  It was unclear what role Mr. Cooper, who was demoted to vice chairman of Simplicity when Mr. Lacey became chairman and chief executive officer, had played in the bid from Mr. Hurwitz. It is also unclear what his future will be with Simplicity.  At Cook International, a pest control and insurance brokerage concern, Mr. McCleary did not respond to repeated requests for an interview. His secretary said he was busy in important telephone conversations. Corporate Background  An MCO spokesman, Howard Bressler, said Mr. Hurwitz was in meetings with Simplicity officials and his lawyers at the Manhattan firm of Kramer, Levin, Nessen, Kamin & Soll and was not available to answer questions.  Mr. Hurwitz, who is 42 years old and lives in Houston, has headed Federated Development for several years. In 1977 he bought a large stake in the McCulloch Oil Corporation, based in Los Angeles, and became its chairman and chief executive officer in 1980.  The company's name was changed to MCO Holdings the same year. Last year MCO earned $19.1 million, or $1.47 a share, on $173.3 million in revenues. Federated controls 46 percent of MCO.

Michaelsen, a 65-year-old executive active on various arts boards, to be its managing director and chief executive officer as of Nov. 1.  Mr. Michaelsen's appointment goes part way to replacing Stewart J. Warkow, who resigned recently as executive director and who will continue during the transition period. It is the hall's intention to appoint an artistic director soon, who will report to Mr. Michaelsen. Mr. Michaelsen, in turn - rather on the model of Anthony Bliss's relation to James Levine and the board of the Metropolitan Opera - will concern himself with overall managerial affairs, business matters and fund-raising.  Mr. Michaelsen is vice chairman of the Phelps Dodge Corporation, the nation's second-largest copper concern. He is co-chairman of the board of the Martha Graham Dance Company, which he has regarded as his primary artistic responsibility to date, as well as chairman of the New York Friends of Tanglewood, the New York support organization for the Boston Symphony; a member of the businessman's committee of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, and a board member of John Houseman's Acting Company, which is in residence at the Kennedy Center.  Mr. Michaelsen said yesterday that his Carnegie Hall position, which he will assume upon his retirement from Phelps Dodge, would be a full-time job. He will continue on the Graham and Boston boards, but not as chairman, resign from the Kennedy Center committee and a number of his corporate boards, and has not yet decided about the Acting Company.  Carnegie Hall found Mr. Michaelsen through an executive-search firm. Yesterday Mr. Michaelsen said that it was premature for him to comment about his plans for the hall. ''This whole thing happened within the last two-and-one-half weeks,'' he said, ''since they first contacted me.'' ''And I spent 10 of those days in South America. I just met the board this morning. One thing I would like to do is help select the artistic director. And I would hope to build a team here, so that the hall won't have to go outside to choose my successor. Not that I'm in any rush to get out.''  Mr. Michaelsen was born in Copenhagen and moved to this country in 1940. He comes from a musical family: his uncle was Denmark's principle musical patron, and a close friend and supporter of the composer Carl Nielsen, who picked Mr. Michaelsen's childhood piano teacher.  Although he will be paid a full-time salary as managing director, Mr. Michaelsen said that his new position would entail a considerable drop in income from his former post. ''But I will have a good pension,'' he added. ''Money was not my major concern.'' Colorado Opera Woes  The Central City Opera, which in the last few years has arguably been Colorado's leading opera company, is taking a ''sabbatical'' this season - a season that would have marked its 50th anniversary. The problem is one of money, and stems most immediately from a failure to raise $100,000 of the projected fund-raising goal last season. The Central City Company's grant from the National Endowment for the Arts was raised this year, and attendance last season averaged 92 percent. But to no avail.  The underlying cause for the season cancellation may reflect a struggle for operatic dominance in the Denver area, said Robert Edward Darling, who is departing as the company's full-time artistic director. When Mr. Darling was hired in 1977, the Central City Opera had no top-level competition in Denver. Central City itself is 40 miles from Denver, and the Central City company was best known for its summer seasons in the city's 19th-century opera house. Mr. Darling's mandate, he said, was to inaugurate a program of opera in Denver during the regular season, and during his first year he presented a production of ''Salome'' there.  But those growth plans were not sustained. And now a new company, entitled Opera Colorado, has announced plans for a Denver season in the autumn of 1983. Nathaniel Merrill, the stage director who has worked often at the Metropolitan Opera, is the key figure, and is working hard at fund-raising. The Central City Opera board says the company will resume operations only when prior financing has been obtained. Another Sabbatical  Speaking of sabbaticals, Gunther Schuller, the artistic director of the Boston Symphony's Berkshire Music Center at Tanglewood, will take a two-month sabbatical next July and August, at the height of the center's activities. Mr. Schuller plans to complete several compositions and the second volume of his history of jazz.  He will continue to supervise the auditioning process for the noted summer music school, however, as well as provide general planning for the center's concerts, which include the prestigious ''Fromm week'' showcase for contemporary music, financed by Paul Fromm.  Mr. Schuller will be replaced during his sabbatical by Maurice Abravanel, music director of the Utah Symphony from 1947 to 1979. In addition, Luciano Berio will be composer in residence this summer, and will serve as acting director of contemporary music. Broadway Idiom Summary: Carnegie Hall has appointed Edward H.

If you watch the Tour on American TV, if you read about it, it's as if you can't mention him.   Speaking out from his vacation home in Aspen, Colorado, the article paints a picture of a man who is at times contrite, at times defiant about his decade-long fall from grace.  Now, Armstrong is stirring controversy once again for choosing to participate in the  ride, cycling part of the Tour de France route just ahead of the start of the prestigious race he won seven times.  Brian Cookson, the president of the UCI, the cycling's world governing body, calls Armstrong's participation in the ride that raises money to fight leukemia  his appearance in the charity race is  the least of his [Cookson's] problems.   It's also not the biggest of Armstrong's problems, as he faces a $100 million  first filed by former U.S. Postal Service teammate Floyd Landis. If he loses, he says it will bankrupt him.  several months ago for driving his SUV into two parked cars in Aspen and letting girlfriend Anna Hansen take the blame, also said he and Hansen see a therapist regularly, and he understands that the public has issues with his seeming inability to fully apologize for his actions, calling himself  evolving as a man on that.    We can all be better people,  he said.  God knows I could. I mean, I was a complete d--- for a long time. I led a life that for 20-30 years everybody just stood around and said 'yeah,' 'yeah,' 'yeah,' and then there was another 'yeah,' and then a whole bunch more 'yeah's.    But I'm not going to be sorry for certain things,  he continued.  I'm going to be sorry for that person who was a believer, who was a fan, who supported me, who defended me, and ended up looking like a fool. I need to really be contrite and sorry about that. And I am. But these other stories are so high-profile, so hot. It's almost like a side business. That's too much. I'm more worried about Mary-Jane in Ohio, and Doug in Pennsylvania, or Liam in Birmingham or wherever.    Listen, if you could walk the world and face to face apologize I would,  he said.  And all the others who were directly impacted ... I mean, I tried to make it right with every one of those people. I can only do so much.

Without more bailout money, Greece could miss two debt payments due to the IMF in May and run out of cash to pay government salaries and pensions.   It's something that the European and global economies don't need  2014 to have another crisis,  Lew told reporters Friday.  Fears that Greece could default and abandon the euro currency group sent shockwaves through global markets Friday. After being down nearly 360 points, the Dow Jones industrial average recovered a bit to finish down 279.47, a drop of 1.5 percent.  Lew said he stressed in a series of one-on-one meetings, including discussions with Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, that it was urgent that the debt negotiations be resolved quickly.  The status of the Greek debt talks was a prime topic on the sidelines at the spring meetings of the 188-nation International Monetary Fund and its sister lending organization, the World Bank. Those meetings were scheduled to conclude Saturday with financial officials addressing a variety of issues  2014 from the weak global economy to a stalled effort to overhaul IMF voting procedures.  The negotiations over Greece's debt have proved contentious. Greek officials said they planned to meet with creditors Saturday in a search for  common ground.   Some finance officials expressed their frustration with Greece's new left-wing government, elected in January. Luis de Guindos, Spain's economy minister, said the Greek government had sent  contradictory  signals regarding the negotiations.   We have wasted very precious time over the last three or four weeks,  de Guindos said in an interview with The Associated Press.  The communication of the Greek government has not been great. They have not made a lot of friends,  he said, while adding,  I expect and I hope that the communication will improve.   Greece wasn't the only country that drew criticism at the finance meetings: China and Japan complained that the United States has still not approved the legislation needed to put into effect IMF reforms that have been stalled for the past five years. The reforms would boost the IMF's resources to deal with financial crises and increase the voting power of fast-emerging economies such as China, Brazil and India.  Lew said he had assured his fellow finance ministers that the Obama administration still believed it would soon overcome objections from Republican lawmakers and win congressional approval for the IMF reforms. The United States is the IMF's largest shareholder and congressional approval is the last hurdle to putting the reforms into effect.  Chinese Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao said in a speech Friday that the failure to pass the IMF quota reforms had damaged America's image.  Growing frustration has caused other major countries to examine alternatives to break the stalemate in ways that might reduce America's global influence.  Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso, speaking to reporters after the G-20 meeting, noted the growing dissatisfaction:  There are other camps who are saying we can leave the U.S. behind and do something else. However, there's a voting power being held by the United States, so it's not realistic to think about other ways.   As the largest shareholder, the United States is the only country that can veto key IMF actions.

            "input": "text:The highly publicized release of the most-wanted list comes as President Xi Jinping presses an anticorruption crackdown that has already brought down one of the country's most powerful former officials and sent scores of security agents on a global chase for economic fugitives and their ill-gotten gains.  Wei Chen, known in China as He Yejun, is wanted on allegations of misappropriating funds before moving to the United States in the late 1990s. Credit Interpol  Last year alone, 680 fugitives suspected of economic crimes were repatriated from 69 countries and regions in the operation known as Fox Hunt, according to the state news agency Xinhua.  This newest phase of the campaign, named Sky Net, was rolled out last month with the publication in Chinese news media of a collection of Interpol alerts that also included one for Yang Xiuzhu, a former deputy mayor of Wenzhou whose stature earned her the top placement on the list.  Ms. Yang previously owned a five-story building on West 29th Street in Manhattan.  The United States was identified as the leading destination by the Chinese authorities, with Canada second and New Zealand and Australia tied for third. The four countries do not have extradition treaties with China, partly because of concerns about due process of law, human rights violations and excessive punishment in China.  The Chinese authorities say the reluctance of the four countries to hand over suspects has made them especially attractive havens for suspected economic fugitives.   Many corrupt officials have chosen to flee to other countries because they can hide themselves behind the complex regulations on extradition and jurisdiction,  Li Zhimin, a spokesman for the Chinese Consulate in New York, said in an email.  Whether those on the list are truly China's most wanted is a question of some debate. Chinese news reports say Beijing has handed Washington a far larger list of about 150 fugitives believed to be in the country.  Ding Xueliang, a Chinese politics expert at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said Beijing preferred not to publicly identify some suspects for fear that they or their families might retaliate by leaking party secrets.  The biggest targets are not on this list,  he said.  Some of these people could cause enormous political trouble for the party-state system by revealing what they know.  Indeed, some experts suspect the list is intended more as a warning to those whose identities remain secret than to those now widely known.  A review of the list found a range of figures said to be in the United States  2014 from the relatively high-ranking Ms. Yang to more mundane characters like Qiu Gengmin, a former export agent accused of stealing money from a Norwegian shipping company  2014 but few top officials.  More from the New York Times:  In casting his net abroad, President Xi has made the party vulnerable to a force far beyond its control: the rule of law at the heart of Western legal systems. Even though there is no extradition treaty, American officials point out that Beijing has other options for repatriating suspects  2014 as long as it can provide credible evidence of their crimes.  Yang Xiuzhu, a former deputy mayor of Wenzhou whose stature earned her the top placement on the most wanted list. Credit Interpol  If American law enforcement agencies can determine that a person is in the country illegally or had lied on an immigration form, he can be deported, though the legal process is time-consuming, and in the case of China, often subject to an evaluation of potential political persecution and the use of torture.  In a statement, a State Department spokesman, Scott C. Lueders, said the United States welcomed increased law enforcement cooperation with China, within limitations.  The United States does not have an interest in serving as a safe haven for fugitives from any country, including China, and will work within the bounds of existing U.S. law to effectuate removals of such individuals,  he said.  In April, the homeland security secretary, Jeh Johnson, met in Beijing with China's minister of public security, and both sides agreed to improve mutual cooperation on the repatriation of fugitives and illegal immigrants.  Whatever the precise standing of those on the latest list, China's state-controlled news media has trumpeted the overall crackdown as proof of the Communist Party's determination to vanquish corruption and bring Chinese criminals to justice  2014 no matter where they are hiding. Western analysts, and not a few ordinary Chinese, also view the campaign through the prism of factional politics, as a cudgel to sideline rivals as Mr. Xi seeks to consolidate power.  The zeal with which Mr. Xi and his allies have pursued corrupt officials has sent shock waves through long-untouchable institutions such as the military and the Politburo Standing Committee. Last month, the nation's former domestic security chief, a retired standing committee member, Zhou Yongkang, was formally charged with taking bribes, making him the highest-ranking party official ever to face corruption charges.  Even so, Steve Tsang, a senior fellow at the University of Nottingham's China Policy Institute, says there are limits to how far Mr. Xi can go in confronting corruption at the apex of Chinese power, prompting him to take his campaign overseas.  Xi still has to do something that captures the imagination, so he's gone from hunting tigers to hunting foxes,  he said.  Within the Chinese community in the United States, there is skepticism.  Among the people on the list, there are some bad guys,  said Ning Ye, a lawyer in Flushing, Queens, for Mr. Qiu.  But there are also some falsified cases.   The allegations against Mr. Qiu,53, arose from his business dealings with I.M. Skaugen Marine Services, a shipping company with headquarters in Norway, which had contracted with a Chinese company to build three oceangoing tankers. Mr. Qiu's company, Zhejiang Changda Import and Export, was hired as an import-export agent to handle customs formalities, including a value added tax, which would be collected, then refunded, once the ships were exported.  But in 2010, he was accused of keeping a $3.7 million tax refund.  Mr. Qiu fled to the United States, where federal prosecutors last year charged him with attempting to launder the money using several bank accounts established in the names of shell companies to purchase real estate, including a beachfront motel in Myrtle Beach, S.C., registered in the name Travelhome 1405 LLC.  Qiu Gengmin, a former export agent accused of taking money from a Norwegian shipping company. Credit Interpol  The use of shell companies to obscure ownership was examined in a recent series of articles in The New York Times that found an increasing use of hidden ownership by foreign citizens purchasing high-end real estate in the United States.  Mr. Ye argued that Mr. Qiu was the subject of Chinese retaliation because of involvement in a pro-democracy movement. Mr. Qiu, who is being held in the Monmouth County Correctional Institution in New Jersey, has filed for political asylum.  Transactions that obscured ownership also appear to have been used by Ms. Yang,67, the former deputy mayor of Wenzhou. She is alleged to have taken bribes of about $30 million while in office.  In 1996, while Ms. Yang was still a municipal official, a corporation called New York International I E Trading purchased the building at 102 West 29th Street for an undisclosed amount. Within months, ownership had been transferred into Ms. Yang's name.  In 2004, when a property manager for Ms. Yang tried to evict a tenant from the West 29th Street property, the tenant filed documents in State Supreme Court saying Ms. Yang was a Chinese fugitive. At about the same time, Ms. Yang transferred the building to a woman in Bayside, Queens, who appears to be her sister-in-law, for $550,000. That same year, it was sold to an apparently unaffiliated group for $2.4 million.  Qiao Jianjun,51, is accused in China of embezzling nearly $4 million from a large state-owned grain warehouse. Credit Interpol  Ms. Yang's whereabouts is not known; published reports in China have said that she has been apprehended in the Netherlands, but the Chinese Consulate would neither confirm nor deny that.  The presence of Chinese fugitives in the United States raises questions about how they were admitted to the country in the first place. There is evidence that several may have lied to the immigration authorities.  Qiao Jianjun,51, who is No. 3 on the fugitive list, is accused in China of embezzling nearly $4 million from the large state-owned grain warehouse he ran in Zhoukou from 1998 to 2011. A federal indictment in Los Angeles last year alleged that Mr. Qiao, and his ex-wife, Zhao Shilan, who is not on the list, lied about their marital status and source of funds to obtain a visa under a program that provides a special path to citizenship for those who invest $500,000. The couple purchased a home near Seattle through a shell company. Mr. Qiao remains at large.  A Justice Department spokesman, Peter Carr, cited the California indictment as an example of how the agency  has repeatedly shown that it will vigorously pursue prosecutions  involving charges of money laundering or other criminal activity by fugitives sought by China.  Ms. Zhao is expected to enter a plea of not guilty on Monday, according to her lawyer, Kirk Davis of Seattle, who added,  We don't have a high degree of trust that the evidence is reliable and accurate because of the nature of the regime in China.   In Florida, the citizenship application of Mr. Chen's wife, Huang Hong,48, known as Linda, was denied after immigration officials accused her of arranging a sham marriage to another man to secure citizenship.  In China, Mr. Chen  2014 then known as He Yejun  2014 had once been among 30 finalists for selection as  Top 10 Industrious Chinese Youths.  He was credited with helping to salvage a tottering fertilizer plant in Hebei Province and to transform it into the Haomen Group, a state-owned beer company listed as one of China's 500 most profitable enterprises. Mr. He was both party secretary and general manager, according to the list.  In 1999, he fled to the United States, seemingly on the heels of Ms. Huang, an accountant for Haomen's Beijing office before leaving in 1998. The government put both of them on a wanted list, accused of misappropriation.  An earlier episode in the United States might have foreshadowed his fall from grace. During congressional testimony in the 1996 scandal known as Chinagate  2014 in which the Justice Department investigated whether China had attempted to influence the Democratic Party through campaign contributions  2014 it was alleged that Mr. He had asked another man to deliver a bag of cash to an American official to obtain visas for Chinese citizens.  It is unclear how Mr. He obtained his own citizenship, but court records show that he changed his name to Chen at the same time.

Read MoreNarendra Modi: Some in India impatient for faster change   He [Rajan] is saying 'enough is enough'. We have given you guys enough chances. The situation isn't improving. So here are we going to give the banks the teeth that they need,  Mr Trivedi said.  The rules follow mounting frustration in India over the inability of the country's state-dominated banking system to grapple with heavily indebted companies.  Recent years have thrown up numerous examples of tycoons who suffered limited consequences from their companies being unable to pay debts, including flamboyant liquor and airline baron Vijay Mallya, whose carrier Kingfisher was grounded due to financial difficulties in 2012.  Mr Rajan warned last month that India's problem with bad debts might not have reached its peak, raising concerns that a legacy of troubled loans could undermine the country's tentative economic recovery.

The RBI's move also relies on the willingness of India's traditionally cautious public sector banks to use their new powers.  However, if the rules do see banks taking control of indebted companies, that could lead to new ownership of some of India's businesses, according to Shinjini Kumar, a director and banking specialist at PwC India   Private equity as well as turnround specialists will find new business here because of this,  she says.  It would be a big change, and certainly a step in the right direction.

Quite frankly, the speed limit for the American economy today probably is around 3 percent, as compared to historically, when most of us were growing up. We remember recovery periods where the economy could grow, 4 or 5 percent,  Russell Price said on CNBC's  Squawk Box.  (Tweet This)  Slower population growth and America's aging society will create less demand for credit, keeping interest rates and inflation relatively low, he said. The current recovery, which saw Americans work to reduce their debt, will also contribute to persistently lower bond yields, Price added.  However, he said he is  very comfortable  with roughly 2.5 percent GDP growth because with it comes continued improvement in the labor market. Ameriprise forecasts GDP growth of 2.9 percent in 2016.  Read More World Bank latest to urge Fed to hold rates until 2016   The speed limit being 3 percent, until we really start to generate some inflation, I think that that's positive. We're still generating pretty good job growth, so that's favorable for the consumer, and I think fundamentals continue to improve in that type of environment,  he said.  Ralph Segall, co-founder and chief investment officer at Segall, Bryant & Hamill, told  Squawk Box  he agreed with that assessment but said the problem in this environment is companies have not been able to drum up much sales growth.  While sales since 2009 have risen about 5 percent, operating profit has grown roughly 14 percent on the back of  a vast amount of cost cutting,  he said.   At a certain point in here, our concern is that if the economy doesn't pick up, you 've squeezed out most of what you're going to squeeze out, and the risk to margins could be tough,  he said.  Segall, whose firm manages $5 billion in fixed income and $4.7 billion in equities, questioned why the price of oil and commodities and interest rates are down if the economy seemed to be getting better.   This is six or seven years into a global recovery. There is no real improvement there,  he said.

The settlement was announced by several state attorneys general on Tuesday.  Enbrel is used to treat moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, while Aranesp is used to treat certain forms of anemia.  Authorities said Amgen violated state consumer protection laws by marketing both drugs for off-label uses, through its promotion of Enbrel to treat mild plaque psoriasis and Aranesp to treat anemia caused by cancer.  The states also said Amgen marketed Aranesp for longer dosing frequencies than the FDA had approved.   Consumers need to have confidence in the accuracy of claims made by pharmaceutical companies,  New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement.  The $71 million will be distributed among the states. Amgen also agreed to change its marketing practices.  Enbrel was Amgen's top-selling drug in 2014, with $4.69 billion of sales. Aranesp sales totaled $1.93 billion. The Thousand Oaks, California-based company reported overall revenue of $20.06 billion.  Tuesday's settlement came after Amgen agreed in December 2012 to pay $762 million to settle criminal and civil litigation over its marketing of Aranesp, Enbrel and other drugs. It also pleaded guilty to illegally introducing a misbranded drug, Aranesp, into interstate commerce.  In a statement on Tuesday, Amgen said it was pleased to resolve the states' claims.

The German artist Tobias Rehberger has covered HMS President, above, in a surreal and striking  dazzle camouflage  print as one of the art commissions marking the centenary of the first world war.  The project sheds light on one of the lesser-known battle strategies of the war: getting artists to paint British ships so that they became floating optical illusions making it difficult for the enemy to target them accurately.  Rehberger first came across  dazzle ships  20 years ago.  I thought it was a funny paradox, to camouflage something with a pattern that is so obvious and so visually strong.   It makes sense after you know what it is, but when you first see it, of course it is  2026 what? This is how they camouflaged their battleships?   It fascinated me for quite a while and I always wanted to do something with it.   The dazzle painting theory was first put to Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty, by scientist John Graham Kerr in 1914.  The idea was not to hide the ships but to make them appear optically distorted so submariners would find it difficult to calculate their course.  Its development was led by the marine painter Norman Wilkinson who first coined the term dazzle painting, while the Vorticist artist Edward Wadsworth supervised the dazzle patterning of more than 2,000 ships  2013 each with its own unique pattern of stripes, distorted lines and garish colours.  Two ships have been given a dazzle makeover this summer: the Edmund Gardner, a pilot ship in Liverpool, and HMS President in London, one of the last three surviving Royal Navy ships built during the war.  Now a venue for events, parties and conferences, HMS President, formerly HMS Saxifrage, was the first type of warship built specifically for anti-submarine warfare and would have been dazzle decorated during the war.  Rehberger said the challenge had been to take such a serious subject and make it contemporary and even funny.  The new work  had to reflect on the fact that things have changed in the last 100 years .   2022 This article was amended on 18 July 2014. An earlier version referred to the Edmund Gardner as a first world war ship, she was actually built in 1953, and a caption identified the Mauretania, in service during the war as a troopship, as the troopship USS Leviathan.

When I'm making money I'm spending it on nice stuff, whether that be lavish holidays for me and my friends or just seeing something and going in a shop and saying, 'Yeah, I want that for the house,' I'm buying it. Spending money on my friends, buying dinner for everyone, drinks for everyone, it's a nice place to be, and I like people to feel cared for,  he adds.  Despite his good intentions, Cavill realizes his candidness could be perceived as cockiness.  People will be calling me a c--- as they're reading this, but travel's great as long as you're going first class. I mean, traveling to New Zealand in economy, it sucks.

Stronger than forecast economic growth figures last week have failed to arrest a slide in popularity for the prime minister, with confidence in his leadership falling four points in the past fortnight to 44%, a 16-point drop from the heights he enjoyed in mid-November.  Related: Tony Abbott reborn as Rudd 2.0 as Turnbull's worst nightmare comes to pass  The poll, published in the Australian newspaper on Tuesday, shows dissatisfaction with Turnbull increased three points to 41%, as he struggles to fill a policy void on tax reform.  Voters were polled between Thursday and Sunday last week, after Australian Bureau of Statistics figures were released showing a 0.6% jump in economic growth in the final quarter of 2015 for overall annual growth of 3%, half a percentage point higher than forecast.  It also followed the leak of sensitive Tony Abbott-era national security documents to the Australian newspaper, sparking a referral to the Australian federal police and renewed focus on the tensions between Turnbull and his predecessor.  In two party-preferred terms, the Coalition is still deadlocked with Labor at 50-50.  The primary votes for both major parties are also unchanged at 43% for the Coalition compared with Labor 2019s 35%.  The satisfaction rating for the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, jumped for the third consecutive poll and now sits at 30%, where it was in September before Turnbull moved against Tony Abbott.

Gillette, the world 2019s largest maker of razors, has  201creason to believe 201d that Dollar Shave Club was making changes to its products and using their patent, a spokesperson told The Journal. According to Recode, Gillette is seeking monetary damages and a court order to stop Dollar Shave Club from selling infringing razors.   201cWe take every violation of our intellectual property seriously, and when necessary, we take legal action to defend our business as we have in the past and will continue to do in the future, 201d P&G spokesman Damon Jones said to The Journal.  Gillette, which controls around 60% of the U.S. retail market for razors, has seen its market share slip as companies such as Dollar Shave Club and Harry 2019s have leveraged the online space to sell their shavers and other related grooming products. In three years, Dollar Shave Club has around 8% of the $3 billion U.S. market for razors and blades, while Gillette has around 20%.

Or what 2019s important? What 2019s important is, what 2019s your satisfaction with the experience? 201d McDonald said during a Christian Science Monitor breakfast on Monday.  201cAnd what I would like to move to, eventually, is that kind of measure. 201d  McDonald 2019s comments set off a political firestorm, with Republicans denouncing the remarks as inaccurate and inappropriate.  House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., called McDonald 2019s comments  201cflippant 201d and said they show  201cjust how seriously the Obama administration 2019s VA is taking life or death problems 201d at the agency.   201cThis is not make-believe, Mr. Secretary. Veterans have died waiting in those lines, 201d Ryan said on Twitter.  McDonald took office in July 2014 after his predecessor was forced out amid a scandal over chronically long wait times at VA health care sites and reports that as many as 40 patients died while awaiting care at the Phoenix VA hospital. Similar problems were discovered at VA health sites nationwide, along with a widespread practice among VA employees of creating secret lists to cover up the long wait times and receive VA bonuses.   201cThere is nothing amusing about VA 2019s performance over the past few years, and comparing VA wait times to those of an amusement park is just plain wrong, 201d said Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Fla., chairman of the House veterans panel.   201cWait times are of critical importance to the veterans waiting for VA medical care and they should be to Secretary McDonald as well, 201d Miller said.  201cUnfortunately, nearly two years after McDonald took over at VA, the department 2019s wait-time rhetoric doesn 2019t match up with the reality of veterans 2019 experiences. 201d  Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a longtime veterans 2019 advocate, called McDonald 2019s comment  201coutrageous and completely inappropriate, 201d especially since McDonald himself is an Army veteran.   201cOur veterans aren 2019t in line for a theme park ride  2014 they are in desperate need of timely access to quality medical treatment, 201d McCain said.  201cThe VA secretary 2019s statement reflects a fundamental lack of understanding about the serious problems plaguing veterans 2019 health care. 201d  Citizens Against Government Waste, a nonpartisan watchdog group, said McDonald was  201cplaying the role of  2018Dumbo 2019 in his very own  2018Fantasyland. 2019 Disney does, in fact, monitor how long its customers wait in line because they have the astonishingly simple belief that serving their customers quickly and efficiently is the best measure of overall performance. 201d  The group 2019s president, Tom Schatz, said in a statement that McDonald  201cseems  2018Frozen 2019 in the past, incapable of understanding that if veterans do not get an appointment in a timely manner, it could cost them their lives. 201d  VA spokeswoman Victoria Dillon said in a statement late Monday that officials know that veterans are still waiting too long for care.   201cIn our effort to determine how we can better meet veterans 2019 needs  2014 knowing that their satisfaction is our most important measure  2014 we have heard them tell us that wait times alone are not the only indication of their experience with VA and that 2019s why we must transform the way we do business, 201d Dillon said.

            "input": "text:Donald Trump 2019s presidential campaign is built on his business acumen. But some of the Wall Street funds that he has invested in have proven less successful, underperforming industry benchmarks in the last 15 months, according to a Reuters examination.  Eighteen out of 21 hedge funds and mutual funds in Trump 2019s portfolio lost money in 2015, and 17 of them are down so far this year, according to public disclosures and private performance data seen by Reuters.  The funds managed by Paulson plcc , BlackRock bbn , Baron Capital bcap and others lost an average of 8.5% last year, according to Reuters calculations, whereas stock market and hedge fund industry benchmarks broke even or came close to it. Trump 2019s funds are down another 2.9% so far this year, underperforming many benchmarks again.  The performances in part reflect broader weaknesses in the investing climate. The last 15 months have been difficult for many portfolio managers amid volatile stock markets, tumbling oil and commodity prices, and an economic slowdown in China.  Trump defended his holdings in an interview with Reuters, saying he invested in the funds three or four years ago and they have done well over time.   201cI put some money with people that are friends, 201d the New York businessman said by phone on Monday, without naming names.   201cI have no idea if they are up or down. I just know that they have been very good over a period of time, 201d added Trump, the front-runner for the Republican nomination for the November presidential election.  Representatives for Baron, BlackRock, and Paulson declined to comment.  To be sure, some of Trump 2019s funds have performed well this year. For instance, Gabelli Funds 2019 gab GAMCO Global Gold ggn , Natural Resources & Income fund, a closed-end vehicle, has gained 16.27% through March 22, beating a benchmark return of 15.89% for natural resource funds, according to net asset value data from Morningstar.  Another fund that Trump has invested in, the Invesco European Growth Fund, gained 4.82% last year versus a benchmark loss of 5.66%, according to Morningstar.  Gabelli and Invesco declined to comment. Both funds are listed as small holdings within Trump 2019s broader brokerage accounts.  The 21 funds examined by Reuters were among 23 funds that Trump disclosed last year in a July 15 filing with the Federal Election Commission. The performance of two of the funds could not be discerned.  The Reuters review included performance data publicly disclosed by 14 mutual funds, as well as performance data on seven hedge funds seen in confidential fund reports or shared by people familiar with those firms.  Trump told Reuters the funds are a tiny part of his investment portfolio.   201cI do very little hedge funds business. I for the most part don 2019t believe in it, 201d he said.  The 23 funds were worth as much as $120.75 million, according to the FEC filing, a fraction of Trump 2019s self-proclaimed net worth of more than $10 billion.  While Trump selected the funds, their managers are responsible for choosing securities to invest in and the funds 2019 subsequent performance.  Some investing experts who looked at Trump 2019s portfolio and Reuters 2019 compilation of their performance were not impressed, saying he could have earned better returns by investing in other hedge funds.  For instance, Reuters previously reported that Millennium Management 2019s main Millennium International fund gained 12.65% in 2015, while Citadel gained 14.3% in its main multi-strategy hedge funds.   201cBy the looks of it, Mr. Trump 2019s investing prowess is very pedestrian, 201d said Brian Shapiro, chief executive of Simplify, which tracks and analyzes alternative investments like hedge funds.   201cFor someone who prides himself on being surrounded by the best talent, 201d added Brad Alford, an investment advisor and CEO of Alpha Capital Management,  201cI 2019m surprised to see so few winners. 201d  To be sure, some of Trump 2019s funds that fell in 2015 have fared better in previous years. For instance, BlackRock 2019s Obsidian fund has averaged annual returns of 3.39% over the last five years, according to a person familiar with the performance.  Obsidian fell 6.17% in 2016 through March 11, while other comparable funds rose 0.69%, according to a private client report by HSBC 2019s hsbc Alternative Investment Group seen by Reuters. BlackRock declined to comment.   201cYou can 2019t measure it in a short time. I 2019m way up with BlackRock. I 2019m way up with Obsidian, 201d Trump told Reuters, without elaborating further.  Trump disclosed a $27.6 million stake in Obsidian in May 2015, his largest fund holding. It is unclear when Trump first invested in Obsidian, which bets on corporate and government bonds, along with interest rates and other securities.  Obsidian was burned by a slide in oil and other commodities, according to a February BlackRock client note seen by Reuters.  Trump 2019s stable of funds include two Angelo Gordon hedge funds, three Paulson hedge funds, and 11 Baron Capital mutual funds. The mutual funds are open to virtually anyone, but hedge funds are only accessible to those that meet minimum wealth requirements, which typically include a net worth of more than $1 million.  A representative for Angelo Gordon did not respond to a request for comment.  Baron 2019s billionaire founder, Ron Baron, is known for long-term bets on companies and an optimistic world view.  Trump uses 11 Baron vehicles with different investment strategies, including small-cap stocks, real estate and emerging markets. Nine of the funds lost money in 2015, with one energy and resources vehicle falling nearly 32%, according to data compiled by Morningstar. Nine are down this year through March 22 with single-digit losses.  Baron 2019s long-term track record is better. The firm 2019s best-known Baron Growth Fund has gained an average of about 8.6% annually over the last five years.  Paulson 2019s funds have produced a mixed performance in recent years. Led by New York billionaire John Paulson, the firm became famous for its prescient bet on the collapse of the subprime mortgage market leading up to the financial crisis.  But in 2015, the three Paulson funds used by Trump all fell, according to data provided by an investor to Reuters. One of the funds, the Paulson Advantage Plus fund, had declined an average of about 22% every year over the last five years, according to a confidential fund report seen by Reuters.  Trump 2019s filing to the FEC lists myriad business ventures, including holdings in hotels and golf properties, as well as individual stocks such as Apple aapl , Goldman Sachs gs and Altria Group mo .  Trump told Reuters his stock picks have done well recently.   201cI bought them low and I sold them high, 201d he said, referring to a series of sales in January 2014 that netted more than $27 million.   201cIt was very good timing, 201d he added.  201cI hit the market exactly perfectly. 201d Summary: But the billionaire seems unfazed.",

            "input": "text:MPW Insider is an online community where the biggest names in business and beyond answer timely career and leadership questions. Today 2019s answer for: What is the biggest mistake you see new hires make? is written by Dawn Zier, president and CEO of Nutrisystem.  When I became CEO of Nutrisystem, everyone there was  2014 as far as I was concerned  2014 a new hire. I was tasked with turning around the iconic brand and it became clear fairly quickly that employees were divided on how to move forward. Some were  201call-in 201d and personally invested in delivering results and adapting to strategic shifts. While others took a  201cwait and see 201d approach.  That to me this is the single biggest mistake any new hire can make, whether you 2019re truly new to the company or whether your organization finds itself in new, unchartered times (if it hasn 2019t happened yet, you probably just haven 2019t worked there long enough)  2013 stop waiting. Waiting for instructions. Waiting for guidance. Waiting for proof.  Learning the ins and outs of a new environment can be tricky. As a junior person, take extra care to learn about the whole company, not just the area you work in. This will give you invaluable context and range. As part of the onboarding process (whether it 2019s formally structured or not), make a particular point of meeting people across all departments. They often end up being go-to people down the road. As a senior executive, this stage is equally important. Meet with all levels across the company to find out what 2019s really going on.  See also: How to Get the Respect You Deserve at Work  Whatever your level, time is not on your side and no amount of research is an effective substitute for hitting the ground running and collaboratively working through things. Until then, you 2019ll likely have only barely scratched the surface of the job you 2019ve been hired to do. You should be insatiably curious, full of constructive questions, and not afraid to ask them. But, don 2019t just fire away. That 2019s disruptive and often is more about voicing opinions than genuinely seeking answers. The difference? Listening. Asking smart questions is not a useful skill if the answers solicited aren 2019t productively applied.  Conversely, sitting back and trying to analyze in isolation will likely lead you straight into the trap of listening to your own internal dialogue and making assumptions about goals, strategies, or customers. That 2019s why so many new hires are stunned when they 2019re let go or receive a bad performance review. In their minds, they were on track and they haven 2019t done anything wrong. Often the latter is true, but it 2019s true for the wrong reason. They haven 2019t done anything wrong, because they haven 2019t really done anything mission-critical. They were waiting.  The best managers don 2019t let this happen. But, let 2019s face it, over the course of a career you won 2019t always be that lucky. So, manage around it. From day one, establish clear 90-day goals with your manager. Then do it, again and again. The busier your manager, the more critical this is. Just because they may not notice you 2019re in wait-mode, doesn 2019t mean it isn 2019t costing you. Waiting to see has a way of catching up with you.  I 2019ve seen many promising hires fail, and many who didn 2019t seem so promising on paper, succeed. And the common thread is that they demonstrated a desire to learn, had an inherent sense of urgency and were committed to the company right out of the gate. Remember: Don 2019t wait. The payoff? You 2019ll see. Summary: It's the biggest mistake any new hire can make",

            "input": "text:A New Home With a Rival View  Billy Joel's new TriBeCa apartment practically looks like a blue-light special next to a condo of similar proportions, although farther uptown and with a slightly better view, that was bought over the summer by Michael A. Spencer, the chief executive of the British brokerage firm Icap.  Mr. Spencer paid $8.7 million in June for a three-bedroom, three-and-a-half bath,2,912-square-foot apartment in the north tower of the Time Warner Center. The apartment is on the southeast corner of the 73rd floor, with expansive views of Central Park.  Mr. Spencer was listed at No. 163 on a list of the wealthiest people in Britain published earlier this year by The Mail on Sunday. The paper estimated his net worth at  00a3253 million (the equivalent of about $457 million). He has been known for throwing lavish parties (one, described in The Sunday Times of London, took place in a ballroom set up to mimic a 1930's Chicago speakeasy and included a faux police raid at midnight) and for an aggressive, even abrasive management style.  Mr. Spencer achieved a certain notoriety on this side of the Atlantic thanks to a long-running rivalry with the bond brokerage firm Cantor Fitzgerald, a feud that grew particularly ugly in the aftermath of terrorist attacks at the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001. Cantor lost 658 employees, more than any other firm.  In June 2002, Cantor filed a lawsuit charging that Icap and Mr. Spencer had poached three top traders from its London office in the wake of the attack.  A British judge ultimately handed down a split decision, ruling that two of the employees had left Cantor because of an unpleasant work environment. But the judge also ruled that Icap had provided an  unlawful inducement  to one of the traders.  Both sides declared victory, but only after evidence in the case, based on internal Icap e-mails, generated some provocative headlines.  In one widely reported e-mail, from Oct. 11,2001, Mr. Spencer wrote to a colleague about his interest in the Cantor brokers, saying,  I would love to plan a heist.   The firms' post-9 11 legal wrangling had been preceded by an earlier dispute in the mid-1990's, in which Cantor was ordered to pay a judgment worth about $1.7 million, for poaching a large number of employees from Intercapital Debt Trading, now part of Icap.  A profile last December of Mr. Spencer in The Sunday Times of London noted that he keeps a framed check for  00a325,000 from Cantor in his office, as a souvenir of the legal settlement.  Like true rivals, Mr. Spencer and Cantor never seem to be far from each other. Just down the street from Mr. Spencer's new address at Columbus Circle, and almost certainly visible from his window, is the building at 110 East 59th Street, at Park Avenue, where Cantor plans to relocate early next year.  Barry Volpert, the former Goldman Sachs executive who paid $24.5 million for Woody Allen's East 92nd Street town house, has taken a somewhat unorthodox approach to the sale of his nine-room co-op apartment at 1125 Park Avenue.  Before listing the apartment with Brown Harris Stevens in May, Mr. Volpert posted a note on a bulletin board by the building's basement gym.   Dear neighbor,  the note began, and went on to say that Mr. Volpert was planning to put his  mint condition  ninth-floor apartment on the market. It said he would be asking  a little less  than a similar apartment on a higher floor that had gone into contract earlier in the year for $5.9 million.   If you or a friend are interested, please call us,  the note said. It was signed  Barry.   The note seems not to have brought any offers, although its placement on the bulletin board turned heads in the building.   It mostly has gym hours and how to use the machines,  one resident said about the bulletin board.  Very occasionally you might see something about baby-sitting. People were talking about it.   Cathy Franklin, a Brown Harris Stevens broker, put out a formal listing for the apartment on May 21, at an asking price of $5.75 million.   We offered the apartment inside the building for about a week before we listed it, in case someone in the building was interested,  said Scott Tagliarino, a spokesman for Mr. Volpert.  A broker's commission on a multimillion-dollar sale can add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Asked if Mr. Volpert would have paid a commission to the broker if a buyer happened to emerge through his note, Mr. Tagliarino said that Mr. Volpert  had no comment on that.   Meanwhile, the apartment remains on the market, and on Sept. 24, the price was dropped to $5.395 million. The apartment is vacant and the Volperts' primary residence is in Connecticut.  Michele Kleier, president of Gumley Haft Kleier, who lives in the building and whose firm is the building manager, said apartments there usually sell quickly.  The last three exclusives I had in the building I sold within 48 hours,  Ms. Kleier said.  The purchase of Mr. Allen's property on East 92nd Street, which went into contract in March and closed in July, was a record for a Manhattan town house, according to Kirk Henckels, director for Stribling Private Brokerage, who tracks such sales. Mr. Henckels said the previous record was a town house at 11-13 East 62nd Street, which sold for $21 million in 1999. Summary: Billy Joel agrees to buy apartment in newly constructed TriBeCa building from Stephen Gans, who closed on apartment in August and immediately put it up for sale; Michael A Spencer recently paid $8.7 million for apartment in Time Warner Center, New York City; Barry Volpert posted note on building's bulletin board asking neighbors to inform friends that he seeks buyer for his Park Avenue apartment before he listed apartment with broker; photos (M)",

(AP Photo Marcio Jose Sanchez)  Oakland Athletics starter Sonny Gray, left, is pulled from the baseball game by manager Bob Melvin, center, during the fourth inning against the New York Yankees on Friday, May 20,2016, in Oakland, Calif. (AP  Sonny Gray 2019s struggles continue in A 2019s 8-3 loss to Yankees  Sonny Gray was supposed to be the A 2019s stopper, a starter capable of curtailing any skid.  But the player who finished third in the 2015 AL Cy Young Award race has looked increasingly pedestrian this season. Friday night, in Oakland 2019s 8-3 loss to the Yankees at the Coliseum, Gray was shelled for five runs (four earned) in 31 3 innings.  It was his second briefest outing in a year defined by inconsistency. A season removed from 14 wins and a 2.73 ERA, Gray lacks his usual precision. Against a middling Yankees lineup, he oscillated between pitches in the middle of the plate and ones in the dirt.  A five-run fourth inning doomed an A 2019s team trying to move forward without top hitter Josh Reddick (broken thumb). Fresh off the 15-day disabled list, Yankees left-hander C.C. Sabathia allowed one run on three hits with eight strikeouts in six innings. Oakland has followed a four-game winning streak by opening 0-2 in its four-game series against New York.   201cI just threw a lot of balls and got even in a lot of counts, 201d Gray said.  201cI definitely didn 2019t put guys away. 201d  Gray had thrown 70 pitches by the time he took the mound for the fourth inning. His control, erratic to that point, completely unraveled.  Ronald Torreyes belted a two-run triple to left. Two batters later, Gray bounced a ball in the dirt. Torreyes crossed home plate as catcher Stephen Vogt chased after the wild pitch. Unable to find the corners of the strike zone, Gray then fired a high fastball that Carlos Beltran hammered for a two-run double.  A smattering of loyal fans stood to applaud the 2015 All-Star as he plodded to the dugout, his night done. He had thrown three wild pitches and a handful more that Vogt corralled out of the dirt. And it could have been worse: Within the first three innings, first baseman Mark Teixeira twice was retired with two runners on base.  Gray 2019s bad start came in the wake of a seven-game stretch in which each Oakland starter lasted at least 52 3 innings. But Gray is the tone setter, and over his past five starts he owns a 10.38 ERA.   201cHe 2019s working really hard on fixing it, 201d said Vogt, who was hit in the wrist in the second inning and could miss Saturday 2019s game.  201cI 2019ve seen a lot of guys get down on themselves, and he 2019s not doing that. He 2019s working, and he 2019s trying to get it back. 201d  Added manager Bob Melvin:  201cHe was just missing with some pitches that got his pitch count up. Then in the fourth, it wasn 2019t as good. 201d  The A 2019s defense has hardly done Gray any favors. In that game-changing fourth inning, center fielder Coco Crisp poorly played Torreyes 2019 triple and Beltran 2019s double.  With the All-Star game two months away, the A 2019s are the only major-league team that has not had a starter pitch more than seven innings. Rookie Sean Manaea, who went 62 3 innings in Monday 2019s 3-1 win over Texas, will try to become the first Oakland starter since Aug. 22 to accomplish that feat when he starts Saturday.  As for Gray? He 2019ll review the video in hopes of returning to his skid-stopping ways.   201cI don 2019t know, 201d Gray said of his recent struggles.  201cIt 2019s just not something that I really expect from myself. 201d  Connor Letourneau is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

            "input": "text:Jun 21, 2016 7:44 PM EDT World  WASHINGTON -- A daring rescue is being attempted at the bottom of the world.  After flying through dangerous dark and cold, a rescue plane landed Tuesday at the South Pole to evacuate a sick worker from a remote U.S. science station, federal officials said.  The plane arrived at the South Pole after a daring 1,500-mile, nine-hour trip from a British base on the Antarctic peninsula, according to the National Science Foundation , which runs the polar outpost.  The plane's crew -- a pilot, co-pilot, flight engineer and medical worker -- will rest and wait for at least 10 hours. Then if weather conditions are favorable, the plane will refuel and return to Rothera, said agency spokesman Peter West. After that the sick worker will be taken out of Antarctica for treatment.   It went all according to plan,  West said from Arlington, Va.  A second worker is also ill, but officials have yet to decide whether that patient will also fly out, West said. The science foundation will not identify the workers, who are employees of Lockheed Martin which handles logistics at the station, nor their medical conditions.  There have been three emergency evacuations from the Amundsen-Scott station since 1999. Workers at the South Pole station are isolated from February through October, the coldest and darkest months when it's too risky for routine flights.  The latest mission is pushing the limits of what is acceptable, said Tim Stockings, operations director at the British Antarctic Survey in London. He said being prepared is key.   The air and Antarctica are unforgiving environments and punishes any slackness very hard,  Stockings said.  If you are complacent it will bite you.    Things can change very quickly down there  with ice from clouds, high winds and snow, he said.  The first day of winter in the Southern Hemisphere was Monday -- the sun will not rise at the South Pole till the first day of spring in September. A South Pole webcam showed the station in the distance during the landing. There was some light because of the full moon and the ability of the camera to operate on low light, West said.  It is still pitch-dark, he said.  The National Science Foundation decided last week to mount the rescue operation because one staffer needed medical care that can't be provided there. The station has a doctor, a physician's assistant and is connected to doctors in the U.S. for consults, West said. There are 48 people -- 39 men and 9 women -- at the station.  The temperature Tuesday afternoon at the South Pole station was minus 75 degrees, with a wind chill that makes it feel like minus 108 degrees according to the science foundation's weather station and webcam.  The extreme cold affects a lot of things on planes, including fuel, which needs to be warmed before takeoff, batteries and hydraulics, West said. The Twin Otter can fly in temperatures as low as minus 103 degrees, he said.  The 1999 flight, which was done in Antarctic spring with slightly better conditions, rescued the station's doctor, Jerri Nielsen, who had breast cancer and had been treating herself. Rescues were done in 2001 and 2003, both for gallbladder problems.  Dr. Ron Shemenski was evacuated from the research facility in 2001 because of a gallbladder infection.   So the skis heat up and when the plane stopped, it froze to the ice which we weren't expecting,  Shemenski said.  So when it was time to leave, we were stuck. We couldn't get the plane loose.   Lt. Col. David Panzera of the New York Air National Guard has flown to the South Pole more than 300 times.   It can go from blue skies... with just light clouds in the air to a total white out,  Panzera said.  A very, very unsafe and very, very strange place.    The challenge is always going to be the temperature and the weather. Those two -- most uncontrollable factors, whether it's our airplane or theirs,  Panzera said.  Scientists have had a station at the South Pole since 1911. It does astronomy, physics and environmental science with telescopes, seismographs and instruments that monitor the atmosphere. The foundation runs two other science stations in Antarctica.

Analysts at the Wall Street firm led by Kimberly Greenberger say that while consumers may have more money in the wallets this year due to the better economy and lower gas prices, there is a good chance that consumers will spend less of those extra dollars than last year.  The bottom line: Greenberger predicts a 1.2% growth in holiday sales in 2015, less than half of last year 2019s 2.8% increase.  The analysts postulate in a note titled,  201cThe grinch will steal Christmas, 201d that this is because consumers now spend less money on apparel in general. What 2019s more, 2015 is predicted to have an unusually warm winter. That will put a damper on seasonal purchases.

While many retailers will struggle, Greenberg and her team predict some retailers may fair better than others.

I have friends that don't like bullfighting, but they have never been,  he says.  It's like a song or a painting; you don't know why you enjoy it, but it gets you deep down.   Jimenez is only 25 but has already been fighting bulls since he was 15, not long after he and his brother Borja, also a matador, began taking a red cape into school in Espartinas, near Seville, to show off their feints and pirouettes.  Now in his seventh year fighting at the Real Maestranza arena in the Spanish city of Seville, Jimenez says he still feels the same fear he did the first time he knelt in the sand to await the bull charging out of the gate.   I asked a matador who had spent 50 years in the ring -- and he still feels the same now as he did the first time.   As Jimenez and the 600 kg (1,300 lb) bull begin to circle around the cape, the crowd cheer every pass with cries of  Ole! Ole! .  In his embroidered gold and white  traje de luces  or  suit of lights,  the matador dodges the horns again and again.  The Real Maestranza is packed for this fight, part of Seville's April Fair, a celebration of all things Andalusian filled with Flamenco dancing and copious drinking of locally produced Manzanilla sherry.  But elsewhere, audiences for a tradition that goes back over a thousand years are dwindling, as new generations shun what they see as a cruel and unfair contest.  Back in the ring, the bull's movements become ever more labored as the barbed stakes that have been stabbed deep into its neck drain its strength away.  With the hulk tottering, Jimenez raises his long, thin sword and swiftly delivers the  estocada,  a deft strike through the shoulder blades to pierce its heart. The bull keels over and, as mules are brought in drag out the body, the band strike up again. This fight is over, the next one can begin.

            "input": "text:Jun 27, 2016 11:13 AM EDT Health  COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Until a new law was passed this spring, it was against the law in Ohio -- along with many other states -- for firefighters or paramedics to provide basic first aid to dogs and cats rescued from house fires, car accidents or other crisis situations. Only licensed veterinarians could do that.  The legislation passed recently makes Ohio one of the first states to protect first responders who administer lifesaving aid to pets, companion animals or police dogs in crisis. Animal advocates say they hope the statute, which they liken to laws protecting good Samaritans who come to the aid of injured humans, removes hesitation for first responders who might have concerns about tending to injured pets.  The law will allow first responders to, without fear of liability, provide oxygen, perform mouth-to-snout resuscitation, try to stem bleeding, bandage and even administer the overdose antidote naloxone to dogs or cats that have ingested opiates. Liability has been a concern because owners of pets have sued first responders who treated animals that ended up dying.   It's another layer of protection for the good guys,  said Cory Smith, director of public policy for companion animals at The Humane Society of the United States.  Ohio's law, which follows a similar action by Colorado in 2014, came about after Bob Swickard, the director of an EMS service in a small town in northeastern Ohio, contacted state Republican Rep. Tim Ginter with concerns about a recent rash of on-duty injuries to police dogs. In seeking guidance from a veterinarian on first aid for dogs, Swickard said he found  a missed loophole  -- it was clearly illegal for EMTs to treat animals. He and Ginter were especially concerned that paramedics couldn't administer naloxone to police dogs that came in contact with prescription pain pills or heroin.   There is the possibility that a dog could get a snout full of something and go down,  Ginter said.  The best that they could do before this law was to call either a veterinarian to come to the scene or call for transport.   Dr. Ed Cooper, head of emergency and critical care at Ohio State University's Veterinary Medical Center, said that as a result of the law, which takes effect Aug. 31, some veterinarians are reaching out to first responders to provide basic training, and first responders are beginning to seek it out.   The hope in having this law passed is really just to give first responders the opportunity and extend the option without the potential for recourse to assist pets as well as people in these kinds of crisis situations,  Cooper said.  So (veterinarians) certainly see it as a positive thing.   What the law doesn't do is require first responders to treat animals, nor does it now make it OK for people to call 911 when their pets get injured or sick. People should still call emergency animal hospitals in these situations.  Smith noted that with two-thirds of American households having at least one pet, it stands to reason that first responders are going to encounter injured animals on the job.   Really, it's just about building humane communities,  she said.  I think when first-response agencies and local governments and especially state governments plan around the fact that animals are such a huge part of our lives, it can only lead to good things.  Summary: Ohio legislation will allow emergency workers to administer life-saving treatment to pets, companion animals and police dogs in crisis",

            "input": "text:While the suicide rate among young children has remained relatively stable, a new study shows that the number of black kids between the ages of 5 and 11 who commit suicide has almost doubled since 1993.  The research, published Tuesday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, shows that from 1993 to 2012, there were a total of 657 kids in the age group who killed themselves in the U.S.; 84% were boys and 16% were girls. Overall, the suicide rate was stable over the nearly 20-year period, yet the rate among black children significantly rose while the rate among white children dropped. Why black children were more likely to die by their own hand could not be determined in this study. The researchers say that the apparent racial disparity needs further investigation.  Study author Jeffrey Bridge, an epidemiologist at the Research Institute at Nationwide Children 2019s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, told the New York Times that he was  201cshocked 201d by the results.  The findings are troubling, and the authors note in the study that historically, the rates of suicide among black children has been lower than the rate among white children. Suicide previously ranked as the 14th cause of death among black children ages 5 to 11 from 1993 to 1997, but it went up to the ninth cause of death in 2008 to 2012. For comparison, among white children, suicide was ranked as the 12th cause of death for the age group from 1993 to 1997 but it dropped to the 11th cause of death from 2008 to 2012.   201cAlthough rates of suicide in adolescents aged 12 to 19 years are roughly 50 times higher than suicide rates in children aged 5 to 11 years, investment in upstream suicide prevention approaches that occur prior to the onset of suicidal behavior may have strong potential to reduce youth suicide rates, 201d the study authors write.

            "input": "text:DEPARTURES Memoirs. By Paul Zweig. Introduction by Morris Dickstein. 219 pp. New York: Harper & Row. $16.95.  IN his memoirs collected in ''Three Journeys'' (1976), the poet and critic Paul Zweig, who died in 1984, identifies himself with an image from Hieronymus Bosch: a figure sealed inside a transparent globe who floats serenely above the world. For Zweig it is an image of the artist, one who ''possesses everything, and also nothing. He has been offered a key to the myth, but the vehicle of his vision is also his prison.'' A similar image appears in Zweig's ''Departures,'' only this time the image of encapsulation and isolation defines a considerably more existential condition:  ''One morning I woke up with the impression that I was locked under a thickness of glass. The impression was so strong, I could virtually see the glass a few inches from my face. It was like a waking dream; I saw my feelings instead of experiencing them, as if my kidnapped body had excreted from it this secret of sidereal space, this smothered distance, which now flowered into one of those overused images the psyche loves: a glass dome.''  Zweig wrote this passage during his last years, while suffering from a lymph cancer from which he was to die at the youthful age of 49. From this vantage, the knowledge of death becomes itself a kind of glass through which he views his earlier life. No longer does the glass dome refer to the artist, floating above the world in a Mallarmean calm; it now prefigures a final exile whose terms are not figurative but distinctly mortal.  The glass-dome metaphor could stand for Zweig's entire literary career, one spent exploring through poetry, essays, biography and fiction what he called his ''addiction to self-awareness'' and the attendant lures of solipsism and narcissism. The titles of most of his books are a summary of these concerns: ''The Heresy of Self-Love: A Study of Subversive Individualism'' (1968), ''Against Emptiness'' (1971), ''The Dark Side of the Earth'' (1974), ''Eternity's Woods (1985), - and now ''Departures.'' Even the biography he wrote late in his life - ''Walt Whitman: The Making of a Poet'' (1984) -dwells on the process of self-making by which the author of ''Leaves of Grass'' transformed his isolation into myth. Something of the same process is at work in Zweig's posthumously published memoirs.  The title that his publisher gave this volume, ''Departures,'' is entirely appropriate for a writer who was always leaving for someplace else and who spent much of his adult life abroad. The book's first two essays describe a period spent in France during the late 1950's and early 1960's, a period in which Zweig came of age as a writer and, most pertinently for this book, as a sexual being. However charged this period was, the same englobed and detached relation to feeling I have described above permeates ''Departures,'' leaving the book oddly impersonal. The essays seldom refer to the author's teaching, writing, marriages, friendships or family. Instead, they focus on a series of love affairs that allowed him to escape, if temporarily, that bubble of self-awareness.  Rather than break the bubble, however, he remains its prisoner, seeing himself as a victim of carnal, grasping women: ''She was the sort of woman who often seemed half out of her clothes''; ''All I could do was fall toward her kamikaze body''; ''I was like an old car, and she was the mechanic''; ''But here was Michele, smelling of woman's flesh, a painter, tearing the crusty baguette with her teeth and slicing off chunks of Cantal cheese with a penknife.'' Such rhetorical indulgence suggests why the relationships ultimately failed. Whatever intimacy he may have desired from women seems to have been mediated by his tendency to turn them into figures of speech. One feels that the poet's lifelong interest in the ''heresy of self-love'' (as he titled one book) was much more than academic. THE stylistic excesses of the first part diminish in the book's final essay, which details the author's final ''departure'' - the discovery of his lymphoma and his subsequent life with that terrible knowledge. The writing here is much harder and clearer than in earlier sections, perhaps because it is less interpretive. He describes with painful clarity his daily regimen of hospital visits, lab tests, sessions of chemotherapy, confrontations with doctors - the constant monitoring of his physical and mental state. His body becomes a supreme metaphor through which he may read himself and the world: ''I was sprouting, I was in flower.'' It is little wonder that he chose Whitman as the subject of his final piece of literary scholarship.  According to the introduction by the critic Morris Dickstein, Zweig was extraordinarily prolific during his last years. ''Writing was life to him,'' Mr. Dickstein says, not an attempt to forestall the inevitable but a chance to interpret patterns and images - like the Bosch globe - that had haunted him from the beginning. Although he wrote in many forms, the memoir may have been Zweig's most appropriate medium. It allowed him to reach back to specific moments and see them in all of their lucidity. But those moments are lonely, filled with a kind of unfulfillable longing that neither sexuality, political activism nor literature could ultimately satisfy. Zweig often veered toward a kind of intellectual invisibility in which, finally, there were no people left. One wants company.  photo of Paul Zweig in 1980 (Robert Mahon) Summary: DEPARTURES Memoirs. By Paul Zweig. Introduction by Morris Dickstein. 219 pp. New York: Harper & Row. $16.95.    IN his memoirs collected in ''Three Journeys'' (1976), the poet and critic Paul Zweig, who died in 1984, identifies himself with an image from Hieronymus Bosch: a figure sealed inside a transparent globe who floats serenely above the world. For Zweig it is an image of the artist, one who ''possesses everything, and also nothing. He has been offered a key to the myth, but the vehicle of his vision is also his prison.'' A similar image appears in Zweig's ''Departures,'' only this time the image of encapsulation and isolation defines a considerably more existential condition:   ''One morning I woke up with the impression that I was locked under a thickness of glass. The impression was so strong, I could virtually see the glass a few inches from my face. It was like a waking dream; I saw my feelings instead of experiencing them, as if my kidnapped body had excreted from it this secret of sidereal space, this smothered distance, which now flowered into one of those overused images the psyche loves: a glass dome.''",

Just one day into the job, May 2019s already outdone her only female predecessor Margaret Thatcher by one measure: she appointed seven women to her cabinet on Thursday who will make up about 30% of her closest advisors. In her time as PM from 1979 to 1990, Thatcher selected only one female secretary.  May filled her previous role of Home Secretary with Amber Rudd, the former energy and climate change secretary. She also selected Liz Truss 2014formerly the secretary for environment, food, and rural affairs 2014to become justice secretary, and former international development secretary Justine Greening to head the education department. (Greening, notably, is openly gay.) Priti Patel is the new secretary of international development, Karen Bradley will oversee culture, media, and sport, while Natalie Evans will take over as the new Leader of the Lords. May even gave a cabinet slot to Andrea Leadsom, her one-time, short-lived rival for Conservative Party head; she 2019ll be secretary of the environment.  Including May, the U.K. cabinet now has eight women among its 23 positions, which includes the newly-created role of Brexit secretary. Former Prime Minister David Cameron 2019s cabinet had seven women and 15 men.  May, who founded a group called Women2Win that aims to elect more Conservative women, was expected to give many of her administration 2019s top jobs to female colleague but the make-up of her roster is still notable compared to female representation in cabinets worldwide. Data from the United Nations shows that in 2015, 17% of all cabinet ministers were women, and most of them were concentrated in departments pertaining to education and family. Twenty-two percent of all national parliamentarians were female, up from 11% from 20 years prior.  At the same time, the gender break-down of May 2019s cabinet falls short of the slate of advisors compiled by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and the one that 2019s been promised by presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. In November, Trudeau appointed a cabinet whose 30 positions were split 50-50 between men and women. He said it was important to present Canada with  201ca cabinet that looks like Canada. 201d Clinton has said that if she wins the presidency, she plans to fill her cabinet with as many women as men.  Beyond gender and professional aptitude, May also faced the challenge of considering her advisors 2019 Brexit affiliations. The June 23 vote, through which Britain decided the leave the European Union, created a deep chasm in the Conservative party, and was followed by an extraordinary bout of , infighting between the most prominent Tories in the Leave campaign. May 2019s selection of seven so-called Brexiteers and 15 Remainers was seen as an attempt to mend that divide and respect the voter mandate to cut ties with the EU. May herself supported staying in the EU, though she did so subtly. May also strove to include as many people educated in the state school sector, rather than the elite private schools whose pupils generally dominate British governments.  With all those factors to consider, May still managed to put together a relatively diverse cabinet. And while she hasn 2019t harped on being Britain 2019s second-ever female prime minister, it matters and so does her appointment of female secretaries, since 2014as the UN data shows 2014women are still sorely underrepresented in world governments and there 2019s evidence that female advances at the highest levels of government tend to inspire other women to run.

The scientists divided 25 smokers into two groups. One group ate about two ounces of dark chocolate containing 74 percent cocoa, and the other consumed two ounces of white chocolate, which contains no cocoa.  The investigators calculated platelet activity and the flexibility of the blood vessels, two measures of healthy function, in an artery in the upper arm of each subject. In those who ate dark chocolate, both measures were considerably improved, and the effect lasted about eight hours.  White chocolate had no effect on the blood vessels. Total antioxidant status also significantly increased two hours after eating dark chocolate, but not after eating white chocolate. The report appears in the Dec. 19 issue of Heart.  The scientists believe the effect is caused by a large class of substances in chocolate called polyphenols, a group that includes flavonols, which are potent antioxidants. Dark chocolate, the authors write, has a higher polyphenol concentration than other antioxidant-rich foods like wine, tea or berries.  Dr. Roberto Corti, a cardiologist at University Hospital in Zurich and the lead author of the study, stressed that eating chocolate will not counter the ill effects of smoking.  We 'used' smokers as a model for decreased vascular function,  he wrote in an e-mail message.  We believe that the beneficial effect can probably be seen in all patients who have a high oxidative stress. This highlights the potential of substances such as flavonols in cardiovascular health.

But he did manage a feat that none of his rivals matched: he wore  201csmart 201d golf shoes.  Spieth, who turns 23 later this month, has generated a lot of praise early in his professional career on the PGA Tour by notching wins at a speedy pace for a man his age. With all those achievements come key endorsements, including most critically his deal with Baltimore-based Under Armour ua . Under Armour outfits Spieth on the course under a 10-year endorsement deal signed in January 2015 (the pair first began to work together two years earlier).  But Under Armour also happens to be an athletic gear company that is betting big on connected fitness, envisioning a world where athletes 2014both professional and casual 2014can track their movements, workouts, sleep and other metrics to boost their performance.  That information can be invaluable for elite athletes like Spieth, but there 2019s a catch. Pro golfers aren 2019t allowed to track their movements with wearable tracking bands, like the UA Band, during competition. So Under Armour took the sensor technology it uses in the company 2019s recently launched  201csmart 201d Speedform Gemini 2 Record Equipped shoe and applied it to the brand 2019s first-ever, custom-made smart golf shoe.  Throughout the four days of competition, Spieth walked around 54,000 steps, averaging 13,500 steps per day during The Open. (Fitness trackers generally recommend 7,000-10,000 steps per day for optimal activeness).   201cData collection is a big part of getting better, 201d Spieth told Fortune.  201cI want to be smarter about how I train. 201d  Spieth says he 2019s tracked his workouts for  201ca while 201d now but really started to hone in on measuring his workouts the past two years. He also says he uses the UA Record system to track his sleep and eating patterns. He shared with Fortune that he prefers to sleep at least 8 hours every night (with the goal of about two hours of deep sleep). In terms of his food intake, Spieth favors  201cwhole, real foods 201d as much as possible, and his go-to snack right now is granola. He admits he could do better staying more hydrated (his goal is to consume at least 140 ounces of fluids each day).  As I learned earlier this year when I tested out Under Armour 2019s line of connected gear, keeping track of workouts, monitoring sleep and other metrics can help athletes perform better on the course (or in my case, while out on a run).  Under Armour admits that these goals can vary. A professional athlete like Spieth might not put as much of a premium on say, counting steps, as he 2019s already active. But the intensify of his workouts and ensuring he got the right amount of sleep 2014especially when traveling abroad 2014those are metrics that are more critical to his day-to-day performance.   201cThe data around overall performance applies in ways that are more important than just runners and cyclists, 201d says Jason LaRose, senior vice president of global e-commerce at Under Armour.  201cGolf is a natural place for us, as it has evolved as a sport over the past 20 years. 201d  As LaRose notes, most connected gear has thus far focused on tracking steps, accounting for walks or running strides, and biking. That 2019s because those movements are easy to track using GPS technology. But Under Armour and others are tinkering with ways to bring that technology and insights to other sports, like golf or swimming.  The golf segment is a relatively new opportunity for Under Armour. The company only began selling golf shoes in April of this year, a collection that Spieth tested and gave some key input. If Under Armour were to bring  201csmart 201d golf shoes to the market, it could help the brand stand out even more in the estimated $9.6 billion global golf market. About 39% of those sales comes from footwear, according to research firm Technavio.  LaRose says its natural that over time, more passive data tracking will come from shirts and shoes, making it easier for individuals to track their progress without having to input much information into their mobile apps.   201cAs a company that makes shirts and shoes, we are excited about that, 201d he said.  201cWe will continue to pursue avenues to make athletes better. 201d  Spieth says that data collection is becoming increasingly important for golfers, a sport that wasn 2019t always seen as  201cathletic, 201d though that is changing thanks to Spieth, and the more athletic builds of fellow golf stars like Rory McIlroy and Dustin Johnson.   201cI 2019m really competitive so it becomes a personal challenge to see if I can work out longer than I did the day before, 201d Spieth said.

But the micro-blogging site managed to shrink its quarterly loss to $107m( 00a384.7m) from $136m last year.  The company also reported a 3% increase in monthly active users (MAU) an important metric for advertisers.  Twitter attracted 313 million MAUs up from 310 million in 2015.   We continue to believe that, with disciplined execution against our priorities, we can drive sustained engagement and audience growth over time,  said Twitter chief financial officer Anthony Noto.  The company's stock fell over 9% in after-hours trading.  Twitter has been increasing its efforts to attract users in the face of competition from Snapchat and Instagram.  In April, Twitter announced a partnership with the US National Football League to stream 10 games in the upcoming season. Media experts say this could have a marked impact on long term user engagement.  Twitter shares plunge on weak earnings  Stolen Twitter logins put on sale  In a letter to shareholders, Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey said:  We are confident in our product roadmap, and we are seeing the direct benefit of our recent product changes in increased engagement and usage .  As expected by some analysts, Twitter saw a seasonal uptick in advertising revenue which rose 18% to $535m. But without strong user growth attracting advertisers becomes harder.  The sombre results have called into question the leadership of Mr Dorsey who is one of the company's co-founders.  He re-joined Twitter as chief executive last year as part of an effort to turn the struggling social media site around. In Twitter's history, it has never produced a profit.  But since his return the company has added just 9 million monthly active users.  Mr Dorsey has made changes to try and make the micro-blogging site more appealing. The firm has loosened its 140-character limit and begun showing tweets in order that users will find more interesting rather than chronologically.  But analysts said the changes had not had much impact.   Clearly, the turnaround is still a work in progress and the question of whether being a platform for a mass audience versus a niche audience needs to be answered,  said James Cakmak, analyst at Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co.  Patrick Moorhead, analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, was also critical:  We are a year into Dorsey coming back and there is really no end in sight of when it is going to start picking up to where investors are going to be happy.

Across the Atlantic, where Democrats and Republicans are in the midst of a bruising presidential election, it depends upon who you ask.  Politicians have always been skilled at finding a fragment of fact to support their arguments and demonstrate how unexpected world events chimed exactly with what they had been saying all along.  Related: America's economic ties with UK still strong after Brexit, White House insists  Britain 2019s decision to leave the European Union has sent spasms through the global economy and exposed obvious parallels between a divided Britain and the deeply divided US electorate .

They want to have independence in a sense. 201d  He later sent a fundraising email to supporters with the subject line making the comparison even more explicit.   201cThese voters stood up for their nation  2013 they put the United Kingdom first, and they took their country back, 201d Trump said of the Brexit vote.  201cWith your help, we 2019re going to do the exact same thing on Election Day 2016 here in the United States of America. 201d  Hillary Clinton 2019s campaign seized on Trump 2019s handling of the situation to prosecute its most successful recent tactic, saying he can 2019t be trusted to stay calm in a crisis or put the nation 2019s interests before his own. Hours after the results of the voting were announced, as global markets were crashing, Trump convened a press conference in Turnberry to extol his golf course.   201cWhen the pound goes down more people come to Turnberry, 201d he told reporters.  Clinton 2019s senior policy adviser Jake Sullivan pilloried Trump, saying his reaction formed an  201cemerging Donald Trump playbook 201d for how he responds to major events.  First, he said that Trump begins with a  201cpathological self-congratulations 201d, noting his reaction to the Orlando gay nightclub shooting the week before. Sullivan then said Trump  201cthinks about and then talks about what 2019s good for himself 201d.   201cHe said that a falling British pound is good for his golf business, 201d Sullivan told reporters.  201cHe actually said that. He actually put his golf business ahead of the interests of working families in the United States. 201d  Related: John Oliver rails against Brexit vote: 'There are no do-overs'  Sullivan and the campaign 2019s communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, repeatedly played down parallels between the impulses that led voters in the UK to exit the EU and the ones that drove voters to a divisive billionaire with no political experience.   201cIt is really important to recognize that a vote on whether the UK stays in or leaves the European Union is profoundly different from a vote for who should be president and commander in chief of the United States, 201d Sullivan said.  201cThis American election is about what 2019s happening here in America, and not what 2019s happening in Yorkshire or in Cardiff. 201d  The Brexit vote was foretelling in so far as revealing how a Trump administration might handle a complicated global event with implications for the US, Clinton 2019s campaign said.  The Clinton campaign went on to release an ad that contrasts Trump 2019s Scotland visit with the global reaction, drawing the conclusion:  201cIn a volatile world the last thing we need is a volatile president. 201d  Other political leaders were also quick to interpret events to draw their own lessons.

            "input": "text:IN mid-August, a moving company delivered Jason and Kristis Cartozian 2019s belongings to the three-bedroom Tudor they had just bought in Port Chester. It had passed all building code inspections with flying colors. Among other things, inspectors deemed the house, the couple 2019s first, watertight and fit to withstand a strong storm.  Less than two weeks after Mr. and Mrs. Cartozian moved into their $520,000 house, Tropical Storm Irene hit. Water began coming through the basement walls, and they found themselves down on their hands and knees trying to stem the flow.   201cThere was no way we could keep up with it, 201d said Mr. Cartozian, an executive with Con Edison.  201cNo sooner had we cleaned up after one onslaught than more water started rushing in. 201d  It was not that building inspectors had inadequately assessed the house 2019s water-readiness, but that they had not factored in the growing incidence of storms, and the resulting oversaturation of the ground on which the house stood.  As Mr. Cartozian put it:  201cHurricanes and flooding rains are not once-in-a-while occurrences anymore. Increasingly, they seem to be coming in bunches. 201d  Which is why he and his wife, a family therapist for the New York City Department of Education, are planning to spend $5,000 or more to add drainage around the perimeter of their home, along with sump pumps and possibly even generators  2014 to further weatherproof a house that they had been told was sound.  Next time, they said, they don 2019t want to wait in line for days behind other frantic homeowners seeking the services of contracting companies.  Throughout Westchester County  2014 along the coastline as well as farther inland  2014 the repercussions from the wet summer are persisting into early fall, and homeowners like Lisa and Wayne Hofflich in Mount Vernon are preparing for more.  The night before Irene unleashed her fury, the basement of the Hoffliches 2019 four-bedroom colonial was bone-dry. By the early hours of the morning, though, their backyard resembled a swimming pool, and the water in the basement had started climbing up the steps to the first floor.  Ms. Hofflich, a silk-screener, and Dr. Hofflich, a dentist, both work from home. Her basement studio was inundated, as was much of his compressor equipment, which had also been stored on the lowest level of the house.   201cOutside, 201d Ms. Hofflich recalled,  201cmanholes were gushing water. Inside the drains backed up. Then the power went off, and the sump pumps stopped working. A freezer in the basement overturned, and we found 150 pounds of meat from Costco floating near the garage. 201d  A month after the storm, they are in the process of filling their second 30-cubic-yard Dumpster  2014 which is the target of scavengers attracted to the Hoffliches 2019 continuing supply of detritus.  The city 2019s Department of Public Works told them they were on the list to be pumped out, but never came, Ms. Hofflich said.  201cWe called a restoration company listed in the Yellow Pages, and they told us we were on the list, but they didn 2019t show up either. Finally our insurance company, Chubb, booked a Pittsburgh company for us, and they arrived, ripped out all the Sheetrock in the garage and basement, and threw out everything that had been in water. 201d The basement smells better, but  201clooks like a bomb shelter. 201d  The Cartozians and the Hoffliches are now among the many homeowners who have decided to take a proactive approach  2014 not passively awaiting the next flood, after which they would again be at the mercy of overworked local officials, restoration companies and contractors.  They are being encouraged to do so by firms like Bruni & Campisi, a plumbing, heating and air-conditioning business in Elmsford, which during the storm began serving customers around the clock, but still could not keep up with demand, according to Mario Bruni, the company president.  201cIt was a juggling act, 201d Mr. Bruni said.  201cMy advice to homeowners, short of standby generation, is to make sure you have a proper sump pump and good drainage around the perimeter of the basement. 201d   201cBut even at $6,000 to $10,000 for a standby generator, 201d he added,  201cwhen you consider the cost of a home and the losses you could experience, it could easily pay for itself. 201d  Shawn Nealis, a pharmacy owner, and his wife, Danielle, a teacher, have lived in the same four-bedroom house in Eastchester for six years. They have been flooded out three times  2014 losing furniture, three hot water heaters and four clothes dryers, among other things.   201cEach time, they called it a 100-year-storm, but three times in six years? 201d said Mr. Nealis, who is now so experienced at keeping his house dry that his friends call him a  201cflood guru. 201d  Over the past six years he has tried a number of tactics. During a storm the first year, he used a firehose to pump water out of his basement. Over the course of the ensuing years, he carefully studied the different paths water followed into the house during storms, regraded the backyard, built a retaining wall and installed sump pumps, among other things. He has also learned how to disconnect the hot water heater quickly during emergencies, he said, so its electrical system isn 2019t ruined by flooding.  He estimates the cost over the years for stormproofing at $50,000. This year, he said, it all paid off when his house remained dry, and he was able to spend his time helping his neighbors fight off the effects of Irene.

And that should show you even more that I don 2019t care. In all honesty, (Gamble is) deserving of the position. 201d  Gamble appears to be a logical potential successor to Baalke, the 2011 NFL Executive of the Year whose job security has become more tenuous on the heels of a 5-11 season. Gamble worked in the 49ers 2019 front office from 2005 to 2012 before he spent two seasons working in Philadelphia when Chip Kelly was the Eagles 2019 head coach.  Gamble has close ties to Kelly, but Baalke said Gamble, who returned to the 49ers last year, was in line to become the 49ers 2018 assistant general manager before his two-year stint with the Eagles.   201cThis wasn 2019t a move that was generated because Chip is the head football coach now, 201d Baalke said.  201cBut did I expect this thought process from the media? Certainly. 201d  Baalke said 2016 should provide more  201cclarity 201d on many of his recent draft picks, some of whom have provided little production. In the meantime, however, he understands speculation will continue regarding his future with the franchise.   201cIf you 2019re in the National Football League, you 2019re on the hot seat, 201d Baalke said.  201cSometimes it 2019s a little hotter than others, but this is a performance-based business. You 2019re here to win. 201d  LB talks suspension: Outside linebacker Aaron Lynch said he unsuccessfully appealed his four-game suspension for violating the NFL drug policy, which was a result of an  201cunreadable specimen. 201d  Lynch, who entered the NFL in its drug program because of a failed test in college, was handed the suspension as a second-time offender. Lynch said the issue was a result of drinking too much water before he submitted a urine sample.   201cIt came out unreadable, and I 2019ve already been in the program, 201d Lynch said.  201cThat 2019s the next step on one of those kinds of tests.  Baalke, who selected Lynch in the fifth round in 2014, said he was  201cdisappointed 201d in the failed test, but expressed confidence in a player who entered the league surrounded by character concerns.   201cEveryone in this room has made mistakes, and he certainly had made his share over the first 20-plus years of his life, 201d Baalke said.  201cBut the thing I 2019m proud of is the direction he 2019s headed. Very confident, we are as an organization, that he 2019s going to be just fine. 201d  Lynch can participate in training-camp practice and preseason games. During his suspension, he can attend meetings and use the weight room at the team facility, but can 2019t practice.  Injury report: Safety Jaquiski Tartt was placed on the active non-football-injury list because of a minor muscle pull he sustained before training camp. Kelly said Tartt would begin practicing soon.  Meanwhile, defensive tackle Glenn Dorsey, safety L.J. McCray and rookie cornerback Will Redmond, who all sustained serious knee injuries last year, avoided starting camp on an injury list. Kelly said they would be eased into practices.  Eric Branch is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

            "input": "text:The latest figures indicate that UK economic growth has halved in the three months to the end of March, continuing a slowdown that began six months ago (Report, theguardian.com, 28 April). This is further evidence of how unsustainable the recovery  2013 which is heavily reliant on consumer spending and levels of household debt relative to income  2013 actually is.  The general election campaign has, however, been dominated by the major UK political parties looking at how they can impose further austerity, cutting the deficit and the debt through public spending cuts, rather than doing so by investing in the economy to stimulate economic growth.  When it comes to total private- and public-sector investment, the UK 2019s record is appalling, coming in 32nd position out of the 35 most advanced economies in the world, a significant concern when it comes to the future prospects of the economy.  There needs to be a radical change in mindset and a focus on increasing both public- and private-sector investment, through modest public spending increases and additional borrowing. This will see the deficit and the debt being cut, but on the back of sustainable economic growth.  Without such an approach the fragile foundations on which the economic recovery is currently based will quickly crumble.Alex OrrEdinburgh   2022 James Meek 2019s analysis (Why privatisation is the key to this election, G2, 28 April) is well argued. It seemed obvious from the start of this government that the top priority was not to save the economy but to use the recession as a front for budget cuts to destroy a large part of our public services and replace them with  201ccheaper 201d privatised companies and so lower taxes. This cheapness is achieved by re-employing public sector workers to do longer hours for worse pay and conditions  2013 hence the poison felt by so many. And with much more to come.SJ ClossEdinburgh  He is the Daffy Duck of politics  2013 confident and self-satisfied, leading to calamity; then he pops up again, unabashed   2022 As a fellow economist I fully endorse Larry Elliott 2019s demolition of Tory party assertions that all is well for the UK 2019s growing economy, and that Britain is paying its way (The Tories 2019 ticking economic timebomb, 20 April). There is a key word that has been virtually absent from current debates on the economy: productivity. If people 2019s rising spending power is not matched by rising production per head, we will suck in more imports without an offsetting rise in exports to pay for them. This is what is happening; the UK 2019s productivity record in recent years has been dismal by historical and international standards; we have a rising balance of payments deficit with the rest of the world of  00a3100bn a year; we are certainly not paying our way.  This cannot be sustained for long. Otherwise we will have to pay for the shortfall by selling off income-earning capital assets to foreigners, thereby further reducing our overseas earnings. This in turn will weaken sterling, leading to depreciation and or devaluation. The effect of this in real terms is to hand over chunks of our national income to other countries. Lawrence LockhartBath   2022 Is George Osborne really clever? Well, no and yes. After the banks had precipitated the 2008 financial crisis, by 2010 there was the beginning of a recovery  2013 only to hit the brick wall of Osborne austerity. This was not an evidence-based policy. It was an experiment which, he promised, would reduce the deficit to zero by 2015. It has failed, to the extent that in the last five years the national debt has doubled.  Meanwhile the bankers, cabinet ministers and other millionaires have been able to sit in comfort while watching the rest of the nation suffer  2013 especially the disabled, the poor and the vulnerable. There has been desperation. A few have killed themselves; about 1 million have had to resort to food banks; 1.4 million have taken zero-hours contracts; around 4.5 million have become self-employed, many of them just trying to scratch a living. That is the background to the much-vaunted fall in unemployment.  Osborne points to a date in the future when the deficit will be eliminated. Another promise! The additional cuts would pile yet more suffering on to those who least deserve it. Osborne is the Daffy Duck of British politics  2013 enormous confidence and self-satisfaction, leading to calamity; and then he pops up again, unabashed, ready for his next adventure. And yet he has convinced many people that he is competent. Now that is clever!Frank HibberdCoventry   2022 Rafael Behr argues for the continued survival of the Lib Dems (Opinion, 22 April). Here in North Norfolk the very ambitious Norman Lamb speaks proudly in support of the coalition 2019s economic policies but expresses no views on the causes of the economic crisis. He seeks to distance himself from the consequences of austerity  2013 the cuts in social services and welfare provision.  Sadly, the only conclusion is that it doesn 2019t matter to him what direction the bus is heading so long as he has a seat on the top deck. Not surprisingly, participation in a future coalition has immense appeal.Professor Martyn SlomanKingston Business School   2022 And so  2013 as Larry Elliott records  2013there were three deficits: a budget deficit, a balance-of-payments deficit and a productivity deficit, but the greatest of the three was the productivity deficit. If we don 2019t raise industrial productivity (through higher levels of investment and skills training, even a state bank and an industrial policy), we will never close the balance-of-payments deficit (and will thus remain a credit-fed, import-led economy), or raise living standards through higher real earnings (regardless of Ed Miliband 2019s plans). And without higher earnings there will be no higher levels of revenue with which to pay off the budget deficit. A depressing catechism? Or a plan of action, perhaps?Peter LythHockerton, Nottinghamshire   2022 Markit chief economist Chris Williamson 2019s pronouncement that the Bank of England is forecasting UK economic growth  201cfuelled by consumer spending rising on the back of higher real employee earnings 201d, albeit with the worry  201cthat weak pay growth means the economy is reliant on ultra-low inflation to boost consumer spending power 201d, leaves much unsaid. He mentions  201cconsumer spending rising 201d but not that it would be debt-fuelled; the average UK household owing close to  00a310,000 in non-mortgage debt by the end of 2016, a new high in cash terms, according to a PwC report. Given their election boasts, the fact that coalition cuts have almost doubled public sector debt, saddling future generations with debt repayments, is bad enough, but the coalition 2019s and the Bank of England 2019s total failure over five years to deal with private-sector debt is worse. As John Hawksworth, PwC 2019s chief economist, said in 2010:  201cThe UK 2019s addiction to debt has reached alarming levels during the past decade 201d, adding that  201cdeleveraging will be a painful process for the UK 201d. Given such a prospect, the headline on Heather Stewart 2019s piece (Low pay rises persuaded Bank of England to hold interest rates, 23 April) looks less convincing than that the Bank is holding interest rates down because of the coming election.David MurrayWallington, Surrey Summary: Letters: George Osborne is the Daffy Duck of British politics  2013 enormous confidence and self-satisfaction, leading to calamity; and then he pops up again, unabashed, ready for his next adventure",

It has changed the way his family watch TV, while peace has broken out in the Utton household  Netflix has always been one of those things we thought might be nice to have 2026 but never got around to setting up. Friends would rave to my wife Heidi and me about shows they had seen, express amazement that we were still getting by on the usual channels  2013 and still, the whole process just seemed too much bother to deal with.   201cIf there 2019s nothing on, we 2019ve always got a DVD box set to watch, 201d I 2019d shrug. And then they 2019d laugh  2013 because I was still buying DVD box sets.  Finally, peer group pressure became too much. Not only were we beginning to feel we were missing out on some of the best television being made, but the pleas from our children (Albert, seven, and Eithne, nine) to take out a subscription were getting increasingly frequent.  And once it was pointed out that many of the films we were paying to rent from Apple TV were also available free on Netflix, last Friday afternoon I finally logged on and took the plunge.  Joining was as simple as opening a social media account. A few personal details, as well as some information about how I was planning to watch Netflix shows (smart TV, Apple TV, tablet, laptop 2026 wait, you can watch on your laptop, too?), and suddenly I was through to the exciting bit  2013 choosing the sorts of programmes and films I like, so that similar shows can be recommended to me.  All at once, I realised just what I 2019d been missing: House of Cards; Better Call Saul; Making A Murderer. With every potential viewing option I highlighted, more appeared in the  201crecommended 201d section.  Profiles were also set up for Heidi and the children  2013 the advantage of giving the kids their own profiles to click on was twofold: not only would they automatically be shielded from unsuitable material (and be recommended only age-appropriate shows), but, to be honest, I knew they 2019d be excited simply by the idea of seeing their names on the TV screen.  Every new show we watch throws up more recommendations  2013 and we 2019re already building up a list of must-see programmesDominic Utton  The best bit? The first month was free, with no obligation to continue after then  2013 and a promise that I 2019d be warned when that free trial period was coming to an end.  The next thing that happened was unexpected. I  201caccidentally 201d didn 2019t do any work for the rest of the afternoon  2013 and watched The Wolf of Wall Street on my laptop instead.  The following afternoon I broke the news to the kids: they were almost as excited as on Christmas morning, when they unwrapped their (joint) Kindle Fire tablet.  After the initial argument over whose profile they were going to use first, they got stuck in. If accessing Netflix on the laptop was as easy as simply logging on to the website, doing so on the TV was even simpler  2013 it was already there in the EPG (electronic programme guide). Barely a minute later and they were rapt in front of Power Rangers: Super Megaforce, and not another word could be heard from them until teatime. Bliss.  In the meantime (and seeing as it was pouring with rain outside), I took the opportunity to instal the app on our iPad  2013 and Heidi and I worked our way through a couple of old episodes of The Office as we set about redecorating the kitchen.  The following evening, as is tradition in our house, we all settled down to watch a film together. Except, instead of paying  00a33 or so to rent one, we scrolled through Albert 2019s top recommended picks  2013 and watched Kung Fu Panda 2  2013 free.  Since then  2013 and barring a few exceptions, Netflix has become almost the first channel we turn to. Every new show we watch throws up more recommendations  2013 and we 2019re already building up a list of must-see programmes.  It 2019s Heidi 2019s birthday later this month: I had been planning on getting her the Better Call Saul box set.

Don 2019t quit here, don 2019t stop writing, keep going until you feel in your stomach,  2018Oh, this is it, this is the new era of Meghan Trainor. 2019 201d  Before that, were you ever worried about getting pegged as the  201cretro 201d girl or getting pigeonholed in a particular style of music?  No. I always knew I 2019m very good at writing the retro stuff, so I always want to keep that with me, and on this new album you will hear that on the deluxe version. But I know that I 2019m capable of doing more. I know it 2019s tricky to put out an album that may sound different, like how Bruno Mars tried to do all these different genres and got called out for that. I thought that was crazy. I thought, if anything, let 2019s praise him for being so talented that he can pull off these different genres. He 2019s one of the only ones getting away with it. So that 2019s what I want to try to do, to be the female version who 2019s going to do all these genres 2014but successfully do them all.  There 2019s a lot going on in this song: you have the late-90s, early-2000s pop and R&B vibes, then you have those guitars. How did you settle on this direction?  We built this track in one day from scratch. I remember we kept saying,  201cWhat 2019s weirder? 201d You hear the breakdown, the doo-wop intro 2014we did that when the song was almost done. We were like,  201cNo, we need a bizarre intro that people won 2019t expect, we can 2019t just come in with these drums. 201d I remember I was like,  201cLet 2019s try to put guitar on this verse, 201d this crunchy, synth-y guitar. It was random, like,  201cLet 2019s break every rule we can find. 201d  The intro is a little sneaky 2014you hear it and think you know what 2019s coming, then it turns into something else entirely. Were you hoping to fake out listeners?  Yeah. When you hear the song without that intro, it was too much,  201cWho is this? Who is this new artist? 201d So I thought, let 2019s give them a taste of what they know, and then let 2019s slap  2018em in the face. [Laughs] In the nicest, sweetest way! A polite slap.  Listening to this song, I get some TLC vibes, some NSYNC vibes. It probably could have been a Britney Spears song 15 years ago. Were there any artists you were thinking about as reference points while creating this song?  Obviously we wanted that  201890s feel that everybody loves and recognizes and misses. I generally miss that on the radio. I wanted it to feel hard, as if Missy Elliott could be on it.  Have you thought about getting a rapper to remix the song? You mentioned Missy 2014I can totally imagine her jumping on the track. Call her up!  If you could get me Missy Elliott, I would totally do that. I 2019m always open to features. I love features. I love collaborating with other artists. It 2019s a great opportunity to meet them. I 2019m a huge Missy fan. I would cry if she did that.   201cNo 201d has a very empowering message for women. With your last record, there was a lot of discussion about whether some of your songs had messages that were anti-feminist or bad for women. Did that conversation influence what you sang about on this album?  I didn 2019t really think about my last record while going into this record, but I did know that I had a few good women anthems, and I have even more now too. I have a song called  201cWoman Up. 201d Like man up, but woman up. I love women anthems, and I know the world likes hearing them 2014even guys.  201cSingle Ladies, 201d I always see guys singing that at karaoke.  I feel like that 2019s a hard song to sing at karaoke.  Yeah, but when you 2019re drunk, you sing just like Beyonc 00e9.  What is your go-to karaoke song?  That 2019s a great one. Recently I did karaoke and they had throwback night: I was doing Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder.  What 2019s the  201cNo 201d video going to be like?  We 2019re shooting it the day the song 2019s released, and it 2019s going to be the opposite of  201cAll About That Bass. 201d It 2019s going to be dark and very cool and hopefully just as awesome as  201cAll About That Bass, 201d but literally the opposite feel. It 2019s going to be a place they 2019ve never seen Meghan Trainor in before, and I can 2019t wait to jump into that world. Summary:  Let 2019s give them a taste of what they know 2026then let 2019s slap  2018em in the face. ",

            "input": "text:At a time when student protests are sweeping across university campuses, McCullough 2019s advice to high school grads offers a reminder to embrace selflessness.  Dr. Wong, Dr. Keough, Mrs. Novogroski, Ms. Curran, members of the board of education, family and friends of the graduates, ladies and gentlemen of the Wellesley High School class of 2012, for the privilege of speaking to you this afternoon I am honored and grateful. Thank you.  So here we are 2026 commencement 2026 life 2019s great forward-looking ceremony. (And don 2019t say,  201cWhat about weddings? 201d Weddings are one-sided and insufficiently effective. Weddings are bride-centric pageantry. Other than conceding to a list of unreasonable demands, the groom just stands there. No stately, hey- everybody-look-at-me procession. No being given away. No identity-changing pronouncement. And can you imagine a television show dedicated to watching guys try on tuxedos? Their fathers sitting there misty-eyed with joy and disbelief, their brothers lurking in the corner muttering with envy. Left to men, weddings would be, after limits-testing procrastination, almost inadvertent 2026 during halftime 2026 on the way to the refrigerator. And there 2019s the frequency of failure: statistics tell us half of you will get divorced. A winning percentage like that 2019ll get you last place in the American League East. The Baltimore Orioles do better than weddings.)  But this ceremony 2026 commencement 2026 a commencement works every time. From this day forward 2026 truly 2026 in sickness and in health, through financial fiascos, through midlife crises and passably attractive sales reps at trade shows in Cincinnati, through diminishing tolerance for annoyingness, through every difference, irreconcilable and otherwise, you will stay forever graduated from high school, you and your diploma one,  2019til death do you part.  No, commencement is life 2019s great ceremonial beginning, with its own attendant and highly appropriate symbolism. Fitting, for example, for this auspicious rite of passage, is where we find ourselves this afternoon, the venue. Normally, I avoid cliches like the plague, wouldn 2019t touch them with a ten-foot pole, but here we are on a literal level playing field. That matters. That says something. And your ceremonial costume 2026 shapeless, uniform, one-size-fits all. Whether male and female, tall or short, scholar or slacker, spray-tanned prom queen or intergalactic Xbox assassin, each of you is dressed, you 2019ll notice, exactly the same. And your diploma 2026 but for your name, exactly the same.  All this is as it should be, because none of you is special.  You are not special. You are not exceptional.  Contrary to what your U-9 soccer trophy suggests, your glowing seventh grade report card, despite every assurance of a certain corpulent purple dinosaur, that nice Mister Rogers and your batty aunt Sylvia, no matter how often your maternal caped crusader has swooped in to save you 2026 you 2019re nothing special.  Yes, you 2019ve been pampered, cosseted, doted upon, helmeted, bubble-wrapped. Yes, capable adults with other things to do have held you, kissed you, fed you, wiped your mouth, wiped your bottom, trained you, taught you, tutored you, coached you, listened to you, counseled you, encouraged you, consoled you and encouraged you again. You 2019ve been nudged, cajoled, wheedled and implored. You 2019ve been feted and fawned over and called sweetie pie. Yes, you have. And, certainly, we 2019ve been to your games, your plays, your recitals, your science fairs. Absolutely, smiles ignite when you walk into a room, and hundreds gasp with delight at your every tweet. Why, maybe you 2019ve even had your picture in the Townsman! And now you 2019ve conquered high school 2026 and, indisputably, here we all have gathered for you, the pride and joy of this fine community, the first to emerge from that magnificent new building 2026  But do not get the idea that you 2019re anything special. Because you 2019re not.  The empirical evidence is everywhere, numbers even an English teacher can 2019t ignore. Newton, Natick, Nee 2026 I am allowed to say Needham, yes?  2026 that has to be two thousand high school graduates right there, give or take, and that 2019s just the neighborhood Ns. Across the country no fewer than 3.2 million seniors are graduating about now from more an 37,000 high schools. That 2019s 37,000 valedictorians 2026 37,000 class presidents 2026 92,000 harmonizing altos 2026 340,000 swaggering jocks 2026 2,185,967 pairs of Uggs. But why limit ourselves to high school? After all, you 2019re leaving it. So think about this: even if you 2019re one in a million, on a planet of 6.8 billion that means there are nearly 7,000 people just like you. Imagine standing somewhere over there on Washington Street on Marathon Monday and watching sixty- eight hundred yous go running by. And consider for a moment the bigger picture: your planet, I 2019ll remind you, is not the center of its solar system, your solar system is not the center of its galaxy, your galaxy is not the center of the universe. In fact, astrophysicists assure us the universe has no center; therefore, you cannot be it. Neither can Donald Trump 2026 which someone should tell him 2026 although the hair is quite a phenomenon.   201cBut, Dave, 201d you cry,  201cWalt Whitman tells me I 2019m my own version of perfection! Epictitus tells me I have my own spark of Zeus! 201d And I don 2019t disagree. So that makes 6.8 billion examples of perfection, 6.8 billion sparks of Zeus. You see, if everyone is special, then no one is. If everyone gets a trophy, trophies become meaningless. In our unspoken but no so subtle Darwinian competition with one another 2014which springs, I think, from our fear of our own insignificance, a subset of our dread of mortality 2014we have of late, we Americans, to our detriment, come to love accolades more than genuine achievement. We have come to see them as the point 2014and we 2019re happy to compromise standards, or ignore reality, if we suspect that 2019s the quickest way, or only way, to have something to put on the mantelpiece, something to pose with, crow about, something with which to leverage ourselves into a better spot on the social totem pole. No longer is it how you play the game, no longer is it even whether you win or lose, or learn or grow, or enjoy yourself doing it. Now it 2019s  201cSo what does this get me? 201d As a consequence, we cheapen worthy endeavors, and building a Guatemalan medical clinic becomes more about the application to Bowdoin than the well-being of Guatemalans. It 2019s an epidemic 2014and in its way not even dear old Wellesley High is immune 2026 one of the best of the 37,000 nationwide, Wellesley High School 2026 where good is no longer good enough, where a B is the new C, and the midlevel curriculum is called Advanced College Placement. And I hope you caught me when I said  201cone of the best. 201d I said  201cone of the best 201d so we can feel better about ourselves, so we can bask in a little easy distinction, however vague and unverifiable, and count ourselves among the elite, whoever they might be, and enjoy a perceived leg up on the perceived competition. But the phrase defies logic. By definition there can be only one best. You 2019re it or you 2019re not.  If you 2019ve learned anything in your four years here I hope it 2019s that education should be for, rather than material advantage, the exhilaration of learning. You 2019ve learned, too, I hope, as Sophocles assured us, that wisdom is the chief element of happiness. (Second is ice cream 2026 just an FYI.) I also hope you 2019ve learned enough to recognize how little you know 2026 how little you know now 2026 at the moment 2026 for today is just the beginning. It 2019s where you go from here that matters.  As you commence, then, and before you scatter to the winds, I urge you to do whatever you do for no reason other than you love it and believe in its importance. Don 2019t bother with work you don 2019t believe in any more than you would a spouse you 2019re not crazy about, lest you too find yourself on the wrong side of a Baltimore Orioles comparison. Resist the easy comforts of complacency, the specious glitter of materialism, the narcotic paralysis of self-satisfaction. Be worthy of your advantages. And read 2026 read all the time 2026 read as a matter of principal, as a matter of self-respect. Read as a nourishing staple of life. Develop and protect a moral sensibility and demonstrate the character to apply it. Dream big. Work hard. Think for yourself. Love everything you love, everyone you love, with all your might. And do so, please, with a sense of urgency, for every tick of the clock subtracts from fewer and fewer; and as surely as there are commencements there are cessations, and you 2019ll be in no condition to enjoy the ceremony attendant to that eventuality no matter how delightful the afternoon.  The fulfilling life, the distinctive life, the relevant life, is an achievement, not something that fell into your lap because you 2019re a nice person or Mommy ordered it from the caterer. You 2019ll note the founding fathers took pains to secure your inalienable right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness 2014quite an active word, pursuit 2014which leaves, I should think, little time for lying around watching parrots roller-skate on YouTube. The first President Roosevelt, the old Rough Rider, advocated the strenuous life. Mr. Thoreau wanted to drive life into a corner, to live deep and suck out all the marrow. The poet Mary Oliver tells us to row, row into the swirl and roil. Locally, someone 2026 I forget who 2026 from time to time encourages young scholars to carpe the heck out of the diem. The point is the same: get busy, have at it. Don 2019t wait for inspiration or passion to find you. Get up, get out, explore, find it yourself and grab hold with both hands. (Now, before you dash off and get your YOLO tattoo, let me point out the illogic of that trendy little expression 2014because you can and should live not merely once, but every day of your life. Rather than You Only Live Once, it should be You Live Only Once 2026 but because YLOO doesn 2019t have the same ring, we shrug and decide it doesn 2019t matter.)  None of this day seizing, though, this YLOOing, should be interpreted as license for self-indulgence. Like accolades ought to be, the fulfilling life is a consequence, a gratifying byproduct. It 2019s what happens when you 2019re thinking about more important things. Climb the mountain not to plant your flag, but to embrace the challenge, enjoy the air and behold the view. Climb it so you can see the world, not so the world can see you. Go to Paris to be in Paris, not to cross it off your list and congratulate yourself for being worldly. Exercise free will and creative, independent thought not for the satisfactions they will bring you, but for the good they will do others, the rest of the 6.8 billion 2014and those who will follow them. And then you too will discover the great and curious truth of the human experience is that selflessness is the best thing you can do for yourself. The sweetest joys of life, then, come only with the recognition that you 2019re not special.  Congratulations. Good luck. Make for yourselves, please, for your sake and ours, extraordinary lives.

A crimson-faced Australian Bureau of Statistics has apologised for the bungled deployment of the survey, and is now claiming that hackers were responsible for the shutdown.  But cyber-attack or no, punters who had already endured a week of at-best patchy access to the poll used the spare time they found themselves with to congregate under the hash tag  census fail   to vent their fury.   Yeah right...where can I send my invoice for all that wasted time...if it's crashed it should at least lock you out, not tell you at the end when trying to submit!!  a nine.com.au reader raged.   Well from my perspective this website doesnt exsist any more so census you have a 1 3rd of my families unsubmitted details the other 2 3rds i think i will update you that information next census. What a joke,  said another.  Others still were even less kind.   What a bunch of wankers lol 10 million people using it at the same time of course it's going to crash lol bring back pen & paper lol,  one reader wrote.  But technical difficulties only comprised one aspect of the brouhaha surrounding the formerly-beloved national snapshot, with many  2013 including a troupe of high profile politicians  2013 questioning why the ABS needs to retain respondents' data for four years.   It seems the ABS has failed to make a compelling case why names must be provided and stored for four years, and unlike any other census in this nation's history since that first census on the 2nd of April 1911, all names will be turned into a code that ultimately can be used to identify you,  Senator Nick Xenophon told the press earlier this week.  Mr Xenophon is heading a clique of politicians, including Jacqui Lambie and Sarah Hanson-Young, who are risking $180-per-day penalties for refusing to identify themselves on their forms.  Damningly, the former NSW deputy privacy commissioner Anna Johnston is following suit, but refusing to fill in the census at all. In the meantime, Labor Senator Sue Lines has called on the overseeing minister, Michael McCormack, to resign.  But Mr McCormack insists that the data will be safe thanks to encryption processes  2013 the ABS earlier this week claimed its cyber security record is spotless  2013 and says Aussies aren't giving up any more information than they would voluntarily on social media.   I note with some humour really that many people are going on Twitter and Facebook making various comments about the Bureau of Statistics, about the census, and about me as well, when in fact wherever they go, it tracks you, on your Facebook account, so I can't really see what the big deal is. I think sometimes it's much ado about nothing,  the small business minister said.  Those who have not filled out the census will not be fined and have until September 23 to complete the survey, while ABS head statistician David Kalisch says he expected the site would be back online by this morning.   00a9 Nine Digital Pty Ltd 2016 Summary: Australians have been left fuming after the census proved itself every inch the debacle it was billed to be.",

But the UN has said the vast majority of civilian deaths have been caused by airstrikes from the coalition, which is supported by the US.  Saudi Arabia has fought hard against criticisms of its attacks in Yemen and earlier this year allegedly pressured the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-Moon, to remove the coalition from a blacklist of groups that kill children during war.  A report released this week by the Saudi-led coalition largely cleared itself of wrongdoing during eight high-profile bombings and concluded that all  safety procedures implemented by coalition forces adhered to international humanitarian law .  The report looked at a number of cases when the UN or humanitarian organisations have accused the coalition of killing civilians or bombing hospitals and humanitarian structures.  The report argued that in six of the eight cases the bombings had been totally justified because of military targets hiding in civilian areas, including hospitals.  In one of the bloodiest incidents, coalition aircraft struck a crowded market in March, killing 106 civilians, according to the UN. The coalition report concluded that there were  huge numbers  of Houthi rebels in the market, making it a justified target.  The UN said there was  no evidence  of military personnel inside the market and called the coalition's distinction making between civilians and military targets  at best woefully inadequate .

            "input": "text:The emotional climax of Terence Blanchard 2019s SummerStage concert on Friday night, at Clove Lakes Park on Staten Island, arrived precisely one hour in, like a timed detonation. It was the title track of his most recent album,  201cBreathless 201d  2014 an elegy for Eric Garner, who died at the hands of police officers on Staten Island just over two years ago. Mr. Blanchard, in his trumpet solo over the plaintive theme, struck a careful tonal balance, sounding haunted but unflinching.  Mr. Garner 2019s last words,  201cI can 2019t breathe, 201d became a rallying cry soon after his death, which was caught on video and viewed by millions. The phrase served a blunt, potent role at protests and on social media, bolstering the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement. It has been printed on T-shirts, signs and buttons, like the one worn on Friday by Mr. Garner 2019s 2-year-old daughter, Legacy, as she distractedly took in Mr. Blanchard 2019s performance near the foot of the stage.  The saying also surfaced, pluralized, in  201cBreathless, 201d via a recorded spoken-word recitation by Mr. Blanchard 2019s son, who goes by JRei Oliver.  201cAm I wrong for believing that one day black and blue would not equal pain? 201d he said. Then, a moment later:  These black roses grow from cracked pavementsFreshly watered with the tears of the voicelessAs we 2019ll emit a muted scream to the heavens:We. Can 2019t. Breathe.  During a long, hard season of activist urgency in black popular music  2014 among artists like Kendrick Lamar, D 2019Angelo and now Beyonc 00e9  2014 jazz has by no means lagged behind. Mr. Blanchard 2019s album, released on Blue Note last year, is just one recent statement of many, driven by indignation, the push for justice and the urge to bear witness.  Of course, there 2019s deep lineage for this in jazz, stretching even further than Louis Armstrong 2019s 1929 recording of  201c(What Did I Do to Be So) Black and Blue, 201d which inspired a crucial early passage in Ralph Ellison 2019s  201cInvisible Man. 201d Any discussion of this topic would have to include Billie Holiday 2019s bloodcurdling lynching anthem,  201cStrange Fruit 201d (1939); Charles Mingus 2019s  201cFables of Faubus 201d (1959), about the fight for school integration; Max Roach and Abbey Lincoln 2019s  201cWe Insist! Freedom Now Suite 201d (1960), a civil rights cri de coeur; and John Coltrane 2019s  201cAlabama 201d (1963), a lament made in response to the notorious church bombing in Birmingham.  The current upswell has been built on this granite foundation: Jazz musicians are nothing if not self-conscious about their forebears. But the dimensions of today 2019s moment have also shaped the music. When the pianist Vijay Iyer began a 2014 performance in Brooklyn with a  201cdie-in, 201d dancers lying on the stage, he was bringing Black Lives Matter into the concert hall. When the keyboardist Kris Bowers performed his song  201c#TheProtestor 201d in Harlem two years ago, it featured a bracing topical digression by the vocalist Chris Turner.  Last year another singer, Jos 00e9 James, released an album in centennial tribute to Holiday, inevitably closing with  201cStrange Fruit. 201d He sings it as an a cappella dirge, with a looping, multitracked moan. It flew mostly under the radar, but Mr. James also collaborated around the same time with the artist Talia Billig for  201cPeace Power Change, 201d a video set to his acoustic cover of Sam Cooke 2019s  201cA Change Is Gonna Come. 201d  Part of the power of that song, in its original context, was a yearning faith in the great sweep of history.  201cPeace Power Change 201d embraces a more intimate premise: A succession of musicians look into the camera, serious or smiling, and hold up handwritten signs bearing the names of victims of police violence, or  201c#blacklivesmatter, 201d or simply  201cJustice. 201d  One of the artists in the video is Keyon Harrold, a trumpeter born and raised in Ferguson, Mo., where the most wrenching confrontations between protesters and the police have taken place. Mr. Harrold tells his story in brief on one track of  201cNihil Novi, 201d a new album by the multireedist Marcus Strickland; he begins by stating his name, as in a testimony.  Names are central to this era of jazz protest, partly because of the influence of social media: When another African-American falls victim to violence by the state, his or her name becomes a hashtag, a trending topic, a tragic new meme. It 2019s a bulwark against the dehumanizing mode of the opposition, and a way of keeping injustice from glazing into an abstraction. The trumpeter Ambrose Akinmusire grasped this idea when he put  201cMy Name Is Oscar 201d on his major-label debut five years ago. The track features a spoken-word poem read by Mr. Akinmusire in the voice of Oscar Grant III, who was shot and killed by a transit officer in Oakland, Calif. (and later inspired the film  201cFruitvale Station 201d).

            "input": "text:And the new policy 2019s numerical parameters are too conservative. According to the Fed 2019s own assessments, normal unemployment over the longer run is well below 6.5 percent. If inflation remains low and unemployment gets down to 6.5 percent, there 2019s no reason to rush to raise interest rates.  The most pressing problem, though, is that the Fed 2019s commitment to its new policies appears shaky. Soon after the December meeting, some members of the policy-making committee spoke out against the action  2014 killing some of the positive buzz created by the policy statement and by a spirited news conference by the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke. Also, the minutes of the December meeting showed that some who had voted for the new guidance on the fed funds rate were skeptical about the complementary action on bond-buying.  No one of the Fed 2019s recent actions is particularly powerful on its own, but together they create a sense of aggressive expansion and commitment to recovery. If the Fed now stops some of them, giving the public a mixed message, the positive effect on expectations could easily evaporate.  So why has the Fed moved slowly, and why are some policy makers threatening to undo the recent actions? In a recent paper, Prof. David Romer of the University of California, Berkeley (my husband), and I found that pessimistic views about the effectiveness and costs of expansionary actions have played a major role in limiting Fed moves over the last few years. Policy makers worry that such actions will do little good and that they could cause inflation, distortions in financial markets and losses on the Fed 2019s portfolio.  I can 2019t say for sure that those views are wrong today. We just don 2019t have enough experience with situations like the current one to have conclusive evidence one way or the other.  But our paper shows that in two periods when the Fed made terrible errors, the same kinds of pessimistic views were present. Faced with the Great Depression of the early 1930s and the high inflation of the early and late 1970s, monetary policy makers did little because they were convinced that action would be ineffective.  Subsequent events proved both decisions wrong. In the 1930s, a propitious gold inflow allowed the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt to conduct monetary expansion without the Fed. Real interest rates plummeted, expectations improved and investment spending and consumer purchases of durable goods took off  2014 jump-starting the recovery. At the end of the 1970s, a new Fed chairman, Paul A. Volcker, concluded that monetary policy absolutely could reduce inflation, and he led the Fed to raise interest rates to historic highs. The recession that followed was painful, but inflation did come down  2014 and it has been low ever since.  WHEN monetary policy makers meet again at the end of this month, they should keep these historical lessons in mind. At the very least, the Cassandras on the committee might want to reread the policy record from the 1930s. The degree to which some of them sound like their Depression-era counterparts might shock them  2014 and give them pause.  The Fed 2019s new more aggressive policy shows every sign of being helpful, and there are no indications that the feared costs are materializing. So rather than trimming the policy before it can bear fruit, why not give it a chance?  Even better, why not give it some extra oomph? Rather than just continuing the bond-buying program, accelerate it somewhat. Instead of just reiterating the numerical guidelines on the funds rate, policy makers could follow the suggestion of Narayana Kocherlakota, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, that they lower to 5.5 percent the unemployment level at which the Fed starts to consider raising interest rates. And if Mr. Bernanke wanted to be truly aggressive, he could broach the idea that in a weak economy, a strong dollar isn 2019t necessarily desirable.  The important thing is that hypothetical fears shouldn 2019t stop the Fed 2019s evolution. History is on the side of doing more, not standing on the sidelines.  Christina D. Romer is an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and was the chairwoman of President Obama 2019s Council of Economic Advisers.

The pair led by a point going into Friday's last medal race but could only finish fourth.  Their nearest rivals, Japan's Ai Kondo and Wakako Tabata, were second, which meant they secured gold ahead of their British opponents.  Englishman Paul Goodison took bronze in the Laser class.  Clark was sixth at the 2008 Olympics and this is her first season with Mills, who replaced Sarah Ayton.  But she was disappointed not to have emerged victorious at the 2012 Olympic venue.

Expectations rise and you want to deliver on that. We are going to do all we can to not be in this position next year.   Mills added:  It was close and we were always catching up, putting on pressure. But it didn't quite come off in the last leg and it is all a bit disappointing really.   We had a couple of unlucky shifts but overall we did a good job.   Goodison, who won gold in Beijing, could not finish worse than fourth in his category going into the medal race, which he won, to earn bronze.   I am a little bit relieved and a little bit disappointed,  said the 33-year-old.   When there is a chance of winning heading to the final race you always want to win the gold.   When there is a chance of finishing first, second, third and fourth, finishing third is probably only halfway.   So I am a little bit disappointed but happy to have medalled again here in Weymouth.

            "input": "text:Home Depot (NYSE: HD) has dominated retail like almost no other company in recent years. The home-improvement leader continues to put up strong comparable sales and profit numbers while its brick-and-mortar cousins in department stores, electronics, and apparel struggle. Through a combination of smart management and a booming housing industry, shares have soared over the last five years.  Who's been driving Home Depot's strong growth? Let's take a look at some of its key customer groups.  Home Depot's customer base can be broken down into roughly three categories.  Generationally, baby boomers are Home Depot's most important customers. The generation born after World War II accounts for about half of Home Depot's revenue, which is unsurprising considering about 40% of the nation's homeowners are boomers, and they own about half of the total home value in the country.  Still, like other retailers, Home Depot's realizes the fastest-growing segment in home ownership is younger people, namely millennials. Home Depot sees the younger generation as more interested in do-it-for-me services and as particularly value-conscious.  Home Depot and Lowe's (NYSE: LOW) are far and away the leaders of the home-improvement sector. Stereotypically, Home Depot is seen as catering more to men, while Lowe's is favored among women, but the reality is that both companies cater to almost identical customer groups. Home Depot, the larger of the two, counted as the favorite home improvement hardware shop for about 33% of men and women, according to Prosper Insights & Analytics, while Lowe's counted 28% of women and 25% of men who said it was their favorite home improvement store.  Men are more desirable customers than women as they spend, on average, 30% more at such stores. Another study found that 55% of customers at both stores are male, while 45% are female. The average age of a Home Depot shopper is 50, and 49 at Lowe's, and Home Depot's customers' average income of $60,800 was higher than Lowe's number of $54,0, though that could be more of a function of geography than anything else.  Overall, Home Depot and Lowe's seem to be more similar than different in their customer demographic, though the two may have different strategies for marketing to them.  Finally, it goes without saying that Home Depot's most valuable customer is the one interested in spending money to improve her home. Since home values bottomed out in 2011, Home Depot's profit has about doubled as Americans have become more interested in upgrading their residences.  Big-ticket items have seen a particularly spike in sales, indicating that consumers are feeling more confident in rising home values, which, combined with low interest rates, has allowed many Americans to refinance, giving them additional income to spend on their homes. Other research shows that home-buying among millennials is finally beginning to pick up, after a delay, which will be a further boon for Home Depot. Finally, the hot housing market has meant that inventory is low in much of the country, meaning home owners interested in upgrading to bigger homes may have more luck simply investing in their current house. In March, housing inventory across the country was 4.5 months, meaning it would take that long to sell through what's currently on the market. That's below what analysts consider a healthy balance at five or six months.  As long as the housing market remains tight and growing, and it looks like it should remain that way for the foreseeable future as mortgage rates are near record lows, Home Depot should continue to thrive.

            "input": "text:The surname  201cCooper 201d might not mean much to you other than the name of that popular British city car, but to MINI, the name is everything. It has adorned every MINI model since the marque 2019s resurrection in 2001 at the hands of parent company BMW, and has largely become synonymous with the brand.  But the name is a tribute to John Cooper, and Mr. Cooper was famous for one thing in particular: racing.  From 1961 onwards, former Formula One team owner John Cooper bored out the engine of a Morris Mini-Minor to 997-cc, fitted it with twin carburetors, and upgraded the brakes and gearbox, and went rallying. The car went on to win the World Rally Championship, as well as several Touring Car races through the years.  FOLLOW DAILY NEWS AUTOS ON FACEBOOK. 'LIKE US HERE.'  Fitting, then, that the MINI tuning house founded by his son Michael in 2001 was dubbed  201cJohn Cooper Works, 201d and eventually folded into the company.  So you 2019d imagine any car fitted with the JCW badge would be a hardcore, rip-snorting hot hatch that goes toe-to-toe with competitors that have it outgunned in terms of power and size, right? I 2019m afraid the answer might not be so clear cut after all.  MINI lent us a 2015 John Cooper Works Hardtop for a week, and we put it through its paces as a backroad bomber and city slicker.  READ MORE ABOUT THE 2016 MINI JOHN COOPER WORKS HARDTOP.  Fitted with a 2.0-liter twin-scroll 4-cylinder turbo, the JCW puts out a respectable 228-horsepower and 236 lb.-ft. of torque. Purists bemoan the recent trend of  201cMaxi-MINIs, 201d but make no mistake, this is still a very small car.  Powering the front-wheels through a 6-speed manual transmission or optional 6-speed automatic, the JCW can pass 60-mph in less than 6-seconds on its way to a top speed of 153-mph. That 2019s territory that was reserved for supercars just a few decades ago, now found at your local MINI dealership.  Speaking of the 6-speed manual, the transmission fitted to our JCW tester was a peach to use, and made driving in the city as little of a chore as we 2019ve ever seen. With clever electronic gizmos that automatically rev-match on downshifts and make it seemingly impossible to stall, the JCW might be home to the world 2019s most accessible row-your-own transmission.  While this feature delighted us in traffic (and gave us an inflated sense of our own driving abilities), it almost feels out of character with the rest of the car, or at least what the rest of the car should be. Nevertheless, if you intend to take this MINI on the track more often than not, seek out the older, more intense GP model instead. We 2019ll take this gearbox for everyday driving, thank you.  Suspension tuning is certainly harder than the base Cooper or S models, but not back-breaking in the pothole capital of the world. MINI has also worked wonders with sound deadening, as this little bulldog is quiet as a mouse on the highway.  Steering feel is extremely responsive, with just the right amount of weight and feedback from the electronically-controlled unit. The JCW truly feels like a go kart in a lot of ways as MINI claims, just without the intense arm workout that usually corresponds.  Three driving modes are selectable with a shift-boot toggle switch, and drivers can choose between Normal, Sport, and Green modes. Why Green mode even exists on this model is beyond me, but you can probably guess which setting we spent the majority of our time in.  Sport mode firms up the suspension and steering and alters throttle response, but almost more importantly, it changes the exhaust tuning from a low burble to a crackling howl. We had way too much fun laying on the accelerator in low gears and abruptly letting off, listening to the turbo spool up and exhale, and giggling at the pops and bangs that emanate from the dual exhaust. If the JCW doesn 2019t always feel like a hardcore hot hatch, it certainly sounds like one.  The JCW looks the part as well, with scoops and flares galore, as well as the handsome 5-spoke black and silver wheels and the $1,000  201cRebel Green 201d paint with black roof and stripes. That 2019s a decent amount of money for a dark green paint job, but we wouldn 2019t want it in any other color.  Inside, the JCW truly embraces MINI 2019s commitment to building  201cpremium small cars, 201d as Alcantara seats, soft touch plastics, and high-quality trim pieces line the cabin. Our tester was fitted with the BMW iDrive-based MINI infotainment and navigation system, and we 2019d go as far as to say that it 2019s one of the very best on the market today.  Buyers can also opt for a heads-up display, which we 2019d highly recommend. Keeping your eyes on the road is invaluable, and having speed information right in front of you is a blessing in the turmoil of New York rush hour.  Overall, the MINI was a blast to drive for a week, and we had a hard time giving the keys back by the end. But like any brand-driven, German-built product, you pay to play, and the JCW is no different.  Starting at $31,450 (before destination charge), the JCW is the most expensive vehicle in a very competitive hot hatch class. At nearly $6,000 more than a base Volkswagen GTI and Ford Focus ST, it 2019s hard to justify opting for the MINI over its larger rivals, let alone the respectable Cooper S. Our tester came out to a total price of $41,800 (after $850 destination charge), and for that money, the VW Golf R, upcoming Ford Focus RS, and even the Audi S3 start to look mighty fine. 300-horsepower and all-wheel-drive are hard to pass up in favor of the JCW.  If you 2019re a hardcore MINI fan that doesn 2019t mind a helping of sticker shock, we wager you 2019ll be very satisfied with the JCW. But if you 2019re looking for a no-frills, throwback hot hatch on a budget to match, it would be wise to look elsewhere.  Did you find this article helpful?

            "input": "text:Australia's second most senior law officer says Attorney-General George Brandis's  radical change  to his role is unlawful and threatens his independence.  Solicitor-General Justin Gleeson says he wasn't told about the new legal services direction which rules no one in government, including the prime minister, could seek his advice without the attorney's permission.  Mr Gleeson described it as a  radical change in practice  after 100 years of the solicitor-general's position having existed.   Do I lie awake at night and think, reading this direction literally, the attorney-general could seek an injunction against me to restrain me performing my office? I do,  he told an often heated senate inquiry on Friday.  But Senator Brandis rejected claims he was undermining the solicitor-general.   Far from being a grab for power, it merely gives effect to existing law,  Senator Brandis told the inquiry.  Mr Gleeson said he had not seen the new direction until May 4, after it was issued by Senator Brandis, and said  the more and more I studied it ... was an unlawful direction.    The change was introduced without the attorney-general telling me about it,  he told the inquiry.   The change is one which is making the function of my office exceptionally difficult.   Mr Gleeson said he had asked Senator Brandis to withdraw the order - which amounted to a  threat  to his office - and engage in proper consultation.  But Senator Brandis says the dispute is a minor  housekeeping  matter which could be resolved in minutes.  He said he consulted Mr Gleeson on November 30 last year on the  substance  but not the form of the legal services direction, which the attorney-general described as a  mere formality .  The attorney's office had sought a meeting with the solicitor-general in April but was informed he would not be available for six weeks.  Senator Brandis said Mr Gleeson had not responded to a further request to discuss the issue in August.   Had the solicitor-general sought to engage with me ... this issue could have been sorted out in a matter of minutes and at no cost to the taxpayer,  Senator Brandis said, adding that he respected Mr Gleeson's independence.  Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is confident the stoush between the attorney-general and the solicitor-general will be resolved eventually.   They support each other,  he told reporters in Canberra as the hearing got under way.   I am sure whatever differences or misunderstandings will be resolved.   Mr Gleeson, in answer to a question from Liberal senator Ian Macdonald, said he had spoken about the issue to shadow attorney-general Mark Dreyfus in June while the government was in caretaker mode during the election campaign.  Mr Gleeson said he wanted to ensure Senator Brandis' statement to parliament, in which he said Mr Gleeson had been consulted, did not go without correction.  Senator Brandis said he had been unaware of the Gleeson-Dreyfus conversation until Friday and had been  shocked  to hear of it.  Coalition senator Barry O'Sullivan questioned why Mr Gleeson had not told Senator Brandis of his conversation with Mr Dreyfus.  Mr Gleeson told the hearing he thought the right thing to do was honestly answer Mr Dreyfus' questions.  Mr Dreyfus said Senator Brandis had misled parliament and should resign.   Everyone in Australia should be concerned by the grab for power we are seeing from this very destructive attorney-general,  he told reporters in Canberra. Summary: George Brandis has rejected a former solicitor-general's claim that his new guidelines on how government legal advice is sought is like a  dog on a lead .",

Many publicly-traded ad technology firms have seen their share prices plummet, while for private ad tech companies venture capital funding has become much harder to find.  According to Terence Kawaja, chief executive of digital media advisory firm Luma Partners, there are valid reasons for investor concern -- most notably, the growing dominance of Google and Facebook , and an otherwise fragmented online advertising supply chain.   201cThere are, by our count, more than 4,000 companies, most of which are venture backed, seeking to eke out a living by playing as an intermediary somewhere between a marketer and the consumer.

You were going to have relevant ads that mattered [to people]. But what did we get? Retargeted ads for something we 2019ve already bought. It 2019s no wonder the whole ad-blocking phenomenon; it 2019s a construct of the crappy consumer experience and we have to be really careful of that. We don 2019t want to screw up a good thing, or a tolerable thing, by turning consumers off to advertising. 201d  For more with Mr. Kawaja on his outlook on advertising technology and digital media, check out the episode and subscribe to the WSJ Media Mix podcast on iTunes, Google Play Music, Spotify or Stitcher.

The Center for Health Information and Analysis, or CHIA, will reduce spending over five years, part of a political compromise struck earlier this year to avoid a ballot question about hospital payments. The deal allowed the state to take money from CHIA to help fund community hospitals.  Backers of the initiative had proposed raising payments for those hospitals by taking money from Partners HealthCare, the state 2019s largest and most expensive health network.  CHIA serves as a clearinghouse for data and tracks how well the state is controlling health spending. The agency 2019s payroll reached a high of 197 in 2015. Agency officials said that will shrink to 132 by next July  2014 a loss of 65 jobs over two years. They said the reductions will be made by not filling vacant jobs and discontinuing contracts. The eliminated positions include data analysts and technology professionals, many of whom were hired on contract.  Get Business Headlines in your inbox:  The Globe's latest business headlines delivered every morning, Monday through Friday.  The smaller head count is part of a budget plan CHIA developed with consultants from the firm Accenture. With a smaller staff, the agency will produce less-frequent reports, but it will continue its core work of analyzing hospital and insurance market data, a spokesman said.  It also will move ahead with a long-delayed plan to build a health care cost transparency website for consumers. It will ask for bids this month and expects to hire a vendor in January to build the website.   201cWe feel confident about the plan that we have put forward, 201d agency spokesman Andrew Jackmauh said.  Some health experts and lawmakers have questioned the budget cuts, arguing that a smaller CHIA might hurt the state 2019s efforts to understand and control rising health care costs.  House Majority Leader Ronald Mariano, at a meeting about health costs earlier this week, said he found CHIA 2019s budget cuts  201cextremely troubling. 201d  Governor Charlie Baker 2019s health secretary, Marylou Sudders, said the administration is committed to making sure CHIA has the resources it needs but said the agency must act in the  201cmost efficient and cost-effective manner. 201d  The agency 2019s staff cuts were reported earlier by the State House News Service.

Bronte and Isabella Watter were abducted by their mother Catherine Watter,42, from their school in Townsville in April 2014.  Police have generated images of what the girls, now 9, would look like today, and their father Michael Watter is urging anyone with information on their whereabouts to contact police.   It's been nearly three years since my heart stopped beating, the day I found out they'd been taken,  Michael said.   I'm hoping that by being here today and getting these pictures out to the public my heart can start beating again.   It's been more than two and a half years since the girls were abducted, and police hold concerns for their welfare.  Mr Watter said he doesn't believe any harm has come to the girls because his estranged wife's relatives aren't acting like anything is wrong.   There's people who were supporting her (Catherine) in the lead-up to the abduction who aren't particularly concerned about her now, so they must know she's okay and not truly missing.   The girls' abduction was the culmination of a long and bitter custody dispute between the couple, following claims the girls were being abused.  A police investigation found the girls were being coached by their mother, and Mr Watter was awarded full custody in 2011  Mrs Watter's phone was found in Strathpine north of Brisbane shortly after the girls were abducted; however there's been no sign of her or the girls since.  Mr Watter said they're asking people across Australia to speak up if they see his Bronte and Isabella   We're relying on public to be the eye and ears for police. If you think you know something and think 'it's none of my business', make it your business,  he said.

Pauline Hanson was set to formally announce the candidates at an event north of Brisbane on Sunday afternoon.  Included on the list was the party 2019s Queensland and national secretary, Jim Savage, running for the marginal seat of Lockyer, which Hanson contested in 2015. She secured a 14.7% swing against the sitting Liberal-National Party MP Ian Rickuss.  The former Liberal-National party MP Neil Symes is running in Mansfield, another marginal seat held by the LNP. The Courier Mail reports that internal LNP and Labor polling shows One Nation is eating into their base.  A recent Galaxy poll put One Nation support at 16%. They won 22% of the vote in 1998, during Hanson 2019s first rise.  Savage told Guardian Australia he expected their actual support to be higher than shown in polls, saying that the same phenomenon that saw polls underestimate support for the US president-elect, Donald Trump, and for Brexit was at play with One Nation.   201cI think what the Trump experience has done and the Brexit experience has told people [is],  2018It 2019s OK, you can change your vote. The world won 2019t come to an end, 2019 201d he said.  The federal finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said the Liberal and National parties would be directly competing with One Nation in Queensland and in Western Australia, which is set to go to the polls on 11 March 2017.  One Nation faces difficulties in WA due to a stoush between One Nation WA, formerly registered as a political party, and Pauline Hanson 2019s One Nation party, which is yet to be registered as a party for the state election.   201cOne Nation is a competitor of ours and we 2019ll do everything we can to explain why people should put their trust in us to provide good government, whether that is in Queensland, or nationally, or in any other [jurisdiction], 201d Cormann told Sky News.   201cObviously it 2019s not a matter of being worried, it 2019s a matter of focusing on the task at hand, and that is to explain what we intend to do to put our respective jurisdictions on the strongest possible foundation for the future. 201d  Savage said the party would take a  201ccalm and methodical approach 201d to the Queensland election, scheduled for 2018, and said while Sunday 2019s announcement would not cover their full state election team, they were unlikely to endorse candidates in all 93 Legislative Assembly seats.   201cIf we find a good candidate for every seat, we will. If we can 2019t find a candidate that 2019s going to be good enough in every seat, then we won 2019t, 201d he said.  201cWe 2019re not just in it to run the numbers.   201cWhen we find good people who really, really are true believers in our cause and our policies who we feel will be good for the people then we will run them.   201cThe last thing that we want to do is get somebody who is not good enough elected to parliament. 201d  Among those already endorsed is Jane Truscott, a US-born nurse with a PhD in rural health who was appointed chairwoman of the $36m Rural Locum Assistance Program in June.  Truscott migrated to Australia 13-years ago and has been endorsed for the seat of Bundaberg, held by Labor 2019s Leanne Donaldson. She is reportedly a strong supporter of Trump 2019s methods.   201cWhile some of what he has said and done is considered socially inappropriate, he has nonetheless provided a political force which gives the American people a voice, 2019 2019 Truscott told the Courier Mail.   201cMany say the silent majority, the disaffected voters, can now be heard. Populist and nationalist politics, such as that of Donald Trump, brings a level of patriotism and pride which is clearly being manifested in Queensland. 2019 2019 Summary: Pauline Hanson 2019s party says support expected to be higher than in polls after surprise election of Donald Trump",

After Sunday night 2019s episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians (in which Swift 2019s feud with Kardashian West and West took center stage) aired, Kardashian West shared a series of videos on her Snapchat account of a phone call between West and Swift discussing the rapper 2019s lyrics about the singer.   201cIt 2019s like a compliment, 201d Swift is heard saying in the video after West reads the lyrics  2013  201cFor all my Southside n 2014 2013 that know me best   I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex 201d  2013 to her.   201cWhat I give a f 2014 is you as a person, and as a friend, I want things that make you feel good, 201d says West, who also thanks Swift  201cfor being like, so cool about it 201d after she tells him she appreciates the  201cheads up 201d on the lyrics.   201cI never would 2019ve expected you to like tell me about a line in your song, 201d says the singer.  201cI mean, I don 2019t think anybody would listen to that and be like,  2018Oh, that 2019s a real diss. 2019 You gotta tell the story that way that it happened to you and the way you experienced it. 201d  After the song was released in February, Swift 2019s rep told PEOPLE the singer  201cdeclined and cautioned him about releasing a song with such a strong misogynistic message. Taylor was never made aware of the actual lyrics,  2018I made that bitch famous.' 201d  In her GQ cover interview last month, Kardashian West claimed video of Swift and West 2019s phone call existed in which the singer had told her husband she would  201claugh 201d and tell media she was  201cin on it the whole time. 201d   201cIf people ask me about it, look, I think it would be great for me to be like,  2018He called me and told me before it came out . . . Joke 2019s on you, guys. We 2019re fine,' 201d Swift is heard saying in the footage Kardashian West posted on Snapchat.  After Kardashian West released the phone call on Snapchat, Swift took to Instagram to defend herself.   201cWhere is the video of Kanye telling me he was going to call me  2018that bitch 2019 in his song? It doesn 2019t exist because it never happened. You don 2019t get to control someone 2019s emotional response to being called  2018that bitch 2019 in front of the entire world, 201d the singer wrote on her social media account.  201cHe promised to play the song for me, but he never did.

Taylor has never denied that conversation took place. It was on that phone call that Kanye West also asked her to release the song on her Twitter account, which she declined to do. Kanye West never told Taylor he was going to use the term  2018that b 2014- 2018 in referring her. A song cannot be approved if it was never heard. Kanye West never played the song for Taylor Swift. Taylor heard it for the first time when everyone else did and was humiliated. Kim Kardashian 2019s claim that Taylor and her team were aware of being recorded is not true, and Taylor cannot understand why Kanye West, and now Kim Kardashian, will not just leave her alone. 201d  Swift and West have had a complicated relationship since 2009, when the rapper interrupted the singer 2019s Best Female Video acceptance speech at the MTV VMAs.

            "input": "text:ATICAN CITY, April 18 - Black smoke pirouetted from a chimney over the Sistine Chapel today, signaling that the cardinals electing the 265th pope had taken a first and inconclusive vote two and a half hours after locking themselves in their tradition-laden conclave.  Tens of thousands of people filled St. Peter's Square, their necks craned toward the chapel's roof and binoculars trained on the chimney. The 115 cardinals had retreated behind its heavy wooden doors in the afternoon, deliberating under Michelangelo's frescoes to choose a successor to John Paul II through secret balloting.  Several minutes after 8 p.m., a wisp of smoke wafted out from a smokestack, and many thought it was white, meaning a pope had been elected with lightning speed. A roar erupted and people surged forward, shouting,  It's white! It's white!  But as the smoke thickened, it became obvious that it was black.   What a shame,  said Erica Barocco,26, of Rome when she finally figured out the color.  I would have preferred it to be white because I want to see a new pope.   Huge television screens in the square made that clear, along with silence from the bells of St. Peter's Basilica. Vatican officials have said they would ring simultaneously with white smoke to confirm that pope had indeed been chosen .   Let's wait for tomorrow,  said the Rev. Crispinus Barasa of Kenya, who is studying in Rome.  Scores of priests in black and nuns in brown and blue robes were in the square for the first such spectacle since 1978, when John Paul was elected. There was also a polyglot mix of tourists and parents with children in their arms, hoping to ingrain a lifelong memory. Already, the crimson curtain hung on the central balcony of the basilica facing St. Peter's for the new pope's traditional first appearance in public.  Despite the confusion over the smoke's color, an election on the first ballot was considered highly unlikely. It is extremely difficult for a candidate to receive the needed two-thirds majority so soon, and the first vote has traditionally been a time to gauge the relative strength of leading contenders and to cast ballots for friends.  The cardinals, after spending the night sequestered in the St. Marta residence behind Vatican walls and probably attempting to reach some consensus, return to vote Tuesday morning at 9 a.m.  The drama in the square followed a day of pageantry and pointed theological discourse by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the dean of the College of Cardinals and John Paul II's doctrinal watchdog.  Considered a possible pope, but more likely a kingmaker for another candidate, Cardinal Ratzinger celebrated a Mass before the conclave today, and in his homily delivered an uncompromising warning against any deviation from traditional Catholic teaching.   A dictatorship of relativism is being built that recognizes nothing as definite,  the cardinal said,  and which leaves as the ultimate measure only one's ego and desires.   For 25 years, Cardinal Ratzinger served as John Paul's theological right hand as prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. In his writings and public statements, he has often sought to uphold the primacy of Catholicism, saying no other religion offered a path to salvation.  Relativism,  he has said, implies - wrongly - that other faiths are equally valid.  In his homily, Cardinal Ratzinger,78, said that Christians were tossed on the waves of Marxism, liberalism and even  libertinism;  of radical individualism, atheism and vague mysticism. He also decried the creation of  sects  and how people are seduced into them, using a term church leaders often employ to refer to Protestant evangelical movements.   Having a clear faith, according to the Credo of the Church, is often labeled as fundamentalism,  he said.  Yet relativism, that is, letting oneself being carried 'here and there by any wind of doctrine,' appears as the sole attitude good enough for modern times.   Many of the cardinals watched intently as Cardinal Ratzinger spoke. Several others among them - two-thirds of the cardinals voting for pope are septuagenarians - appeared to doze. Summary: The smoke indicated that the cardinals had voted inconclusively in their first attempt to elect a successor to Pope John Paul II.",

            "input": "text:Chris at the Lister Park weather station  Of course, it's a British tradition - if there's nothing else to talk about, there's always the weather. But Chris, who's a Parks Gardener at Lister Park, takes this to a whole new level. After all, he's the man who has one hundred years of Bradford's weather at his fingertips! If you're in the park at nine o'clock in the morning - any morning - he'll be the figure you'll see purposely striding towards a little fenced-off enclosure full of strange looking devices. He's been doing this for over three decades but shows as much enthusiasm for the job as ever!  Chris tests the wind direction   This looks like a beehive,  says Chris pointing to a slatted wooden box on legs in Lister Park's weather enclosure.  A lot of children think it's a beehive, but it isn't. It's a 'Stevenson's screen' and inside it houses some thermometers. There are four of them in there. There's a maximum and a minimum thermometer - obviously your maximum is a day behind because it's yesterday's maximum - and the minimum is for the same day as you're doing the readings. Then there are two upright thermometers - a 'hygrometer' and from that you can work out the humidity in the air.   It's from this box of tricks that Chris takes some of his weather readings, much as his predecessors have done every single day since 1st January 1908. Whatever the weather, somebody's been out in Lister Park to take note of what, meteorologically, has been going on. Come rain or shine, it's all been noted down and sent off to the Met Office - on paper and more recently online. The technology might have changed, but it's all still about the one thing that gets us all talking - the weather!  On the ground nearby are some more odd-looking things - easy to trip over, in fact, if you're not looking! Chris explains that they're more thermometers:  These go underground and are called earth thermometers. One of them is four feet deep and the other one is one foot deep. That one [the one foot earth thermometer] can get quite cold, near freezing, but if the other one gets freezing then it's the Ice Age!   Simon checks the underground temperature  While Chris takes today's readings from the earth thermometer, his colleague Simon Drake appears. He's the Assistant Parks and Landscape Manager for Bradford and knowns a thing or two about the weather station too. Simon points out that taking note of weather at Lister Park isn't all about technology. Sometimes, he says, you have to rely on simpler ways of measuring the weather - like gauging wind speed and direction, for instance:  It's a matter of facing north and throwing something in the air and looking which way it falls! Also it's the observation of clouds, the direction the clouds are going. We also have a gauge for windspeed, the Beaufort Scale. You look at that with respect to flags extending, leaves and twigs in constant motion, trees bending. You can gauge it from that.  Finished with his thermometers, Chris adds:  The Beaufort Scale goes right up to twelve although we don't get twelve inland as that's a hurricane. The most you'll get here is force eight or nine. I recorded force six this morning which is a strong breeze, but you don't record the gusts, you record the constant wind speed.   There are also some things that just can't really be measured properly by anything else than the human eye. Over 34 years, Chris has developed a few tricks of his own - including how to measure visibility, another important aspect of recording the weather:  You can tell if it's going to be a clear day or if it's going to be misty or foggy. What we have is six or seven different points. The first one is Hollins Hill, a few miles away, and it's the clearest point we can see today...Then we have, through the trees, a church spire and that's Heaton Church. If you can [only] see the church then it's fog. Then, you come back from looking there and there's Listers Mill chimney, the park boundary and the bandstand. If you can't see the bandstand then you'll be lost, basically!   Chris looks at recent readings  Of course, all these readings have to go somewhere to be compiled with those from other weather stations across West Yorkshire, the UK and the world! Simon explains:  This is a Met Office station so all the information goes there. Now, the readings go electronically on a daily basis, but we used to send them on a monthly basis on a large sheet of paper...Then there's other stuff we put in the diary like cloud cover and so on...But the Met Office does get all our information. I also used to send a monthly record to Paul Hudson at the BBC but because he's got access to the Met Office site now, he just gets the information from there. But any observations that are out of the normal, like the lowest October temperature, I e-mail to Paul and sometimes he mentions that during his TV appearances.   Lister Park's very own weatherman Chris says he feels that the work he does at nine o'clock every morning really does help to build a picture of what's going on weather-wise in West Yorkshire:  Stations like this do help Paul Hudson and the Met Office to find out what the average temperatures are for an area. No matter what part of England you go to, the forecasters will say, 'The average temperature will be...' and it's little stations like this that help them know what that average temperature is, or the average rainfall.   Rainfall being one of this country's - and this county's - favourite talking points, this is a good chance for Chris to reveal some of the meteorological high and low points from the past 100 years. As far as rain's concerned, Chris doesn't have to look far through the records:  The wettest month we've ever had was June 2007. You'll remember all that flooding we had, well we had just over ten inches of rain that month. It outdoes any other month by two inches or so - ten and a quarter inches fell in one month. Quite a lot! Over the year, the highest rainfall we've had was 44.85 inches and that was in the year 2000, not so long ago either.  And what about temperature? Well, it was in the 1950s that the mercury rose the highest:  The last warmest maximum was 31.1 degrees Celsius [88 degrees Fahrenheit] and that was on 12th August 1953 so you're going back a long time. A more recent one, well there aren't any really. They all go back to the 1940s and 1950s for warm temperatures. The past really was a lot warmer. As far as the coldest minimum temperatures are concerned, obviously they'll be night temperatures and it was -13.9 Celsius on 21st January 1940, that's only seven degrees Fahrenheit. Very, very cold for a night temperature.   Weather symbols surround the equipment  During his time taking the weather readings at Lister Park, Chris has also noticed certain trends:  We're getting warmer winters and they're a lot wetter. I've noticed over the years that the monthly averages are getting slightly warmer, especially in winter.  Chris also echoes what many of us have noticed - snow seems to be increasingly a rarity:  We don't seem to get the falls like we did 20 or 30 years ago. I can remember when I was a kid going out and you were up to your neck in snow. These days it comes one day and it's gone the next!   With that, it's time for Chris to return to his other tasks around Lister Park. Over three decades since he started taking the daily readings, he still clearly relishes his part in making sure that West Yorkshire's weather is noted down for posterity.

A record-breaking 3 million people jammed Manhattan streets yesterday to cheer on the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade under bright skies and a gloriously warm sun.   I've been coming to the parade for 20 years, and this is the best one I can remember,  said Albert Calderon,38, a deliveryman from Teaneck, N.J.  The crowds are great, the weather is perfect - we really lucked out.   Huge crowds oohed and aahed at Garfield, Kermit and Clifford the Big Red Dog in the 77th annual extravaganza, ringing in the holiday season.   This year, my brother-in-law is cooking dinner, and I thought this was a golden opportunity,  said Denise Harford,52, of Staten Island, whose son returned last week from Iraq.  I love being at the parade. Everyone's got the spirit.   Last year's temperatures peaked at a chilly 31 degrees, but no one needed hats and gloves this year. The mercury hovered in the 50s.  Latecomers had to scramble to the tops of parked cars in order to peer over the early birds who snagged spots that put them an arm's length away from Elmo, Barney and  Hairspray  star decked out as Mrs. Claus.   I was here at a little after 6 a.m. and I still wasn't able to get a spot right on the street,  said Manuel Melendez,32, of the Bronx, who brought his two kids to Columbus Circle in order to see their favorite, Jimmy Neutron.  It's hard to admit, but someone wanted it more than me.   After Tom Turkey took his traditional position at the front of the 2 1 2-mile route that began at W. 77th St. and Central Park West, he was followed by favorites and first-timers, including Super Grover and this year's official parade mascot, Garfield.  More than two dozen floats followed - including one sponsored by the Daily News, which featured city landmarks and Yankee star Bernie Williams - and 10 marching bands that came from as far away as Birmingham, Ala., and Colleyville, Tex.  Part of that buoyant crowd were hundreds of plainclothed cops who joined more 2,000 of their uniformed brethren, beefing up security along the route. Several NYPD helicopters also thundered overhead to protect the parade, which was viewed as a potential terrorist target in light of recent attacks overseas, a police spokesman said.  Their efforts - and those of the armed forces overseas - were saluted by Mayor Bloomberg, who watched some of the parade from a midtown restaurant surrounded by kids from the Ronald McDonald House.   It's a good time to be a little bit patriotic and realize just how lucky we are to have the freedoms we do,  said Bloomberg, who selected Uncle Sam as his favorite balloon this year after picking Charlie Brown in 2002 because he identified with the lovable blockhead.  This is what makes New York, New York.   Total number of balloons in parade.  The last year the Uncle Sam balloon appeared in the parade before yesterday.  2 Clay Aiken and Ruben Studdard.  Number of American Idol finalists who rode on the floats.  Amount of Garfield's favorite food that would fill giant mascot (equivalent to 13,900 cubic feet of helium) Summary: Mother Nature must love a New York parade.

The draft, which was published on Tuesday, states that no law shall be approved which contradicts  the rules of Islam .That could set Iraq on a course different from what was envisioned when US-led forces invaded the country in 2003. Islam is the official religion of the state and is the main source of legislation,  the draft reads.  No law that contradicts with its rules can be promulgated. The document grants the Shia religious leadership in Najaf  independence for its guiding role  in recognition of its  high national and religious symbolism .Al-Sabah noted, however, that there were unspecified differences among the committee on the Najaf portion.Those would presumably include Kurds, Sunni Arabs and Shias on the 71-member committee.During the US-led occupation, key Iraqi Shia and some Sunni politicians sought to have Islam formally designated as the main source of legislation in the interim constitution, which went into effect in March 2004.Bremer blocked Iraqi move  However, the former US-appointed governor of Iraq, Paul Bremer, blocked the move, saying Islam would be considered  a source  - but not the only one.  The former US governor PaulBremer blocked previous moves  At the time, prominent Shia politicians agreed to forego a public battle with Bremer and raise the issue again during the drafting of the permanent constitution.It could move Iraq towards a more religiously based society than was envisioned by the US that hoped the country would serve a beacon of Western-style democracy in the region.Members of the constitutional committee, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the draft in Al-Sabah was among several and none would be final until parliament approves the charter by 15 August.  Contentious issuesThe drafting committee met on Tuesday to discuss federalism, one of the most contentious issues, according to Sunni Arab member Mohammed Abed-Rabbou.He described the discussion as heated and said no agreement on the issue was reached.According to Al-Sabah, the draft constitution would declare Iraq a sovereign state with  a republican democratic federal system . However, the word  federal  appears in brackets, indicating some opposition among the committee.   Islam is the official religion of the state and is the main source of legislation Iraq's draft constitution  Sunni Arabs are suspicious that federalism, a prime goal of the Kurds, would lead to the disintegration of the country.Parliament speaker Hajim al-Hassani, a Sunni Arab, urged Iraqi media on Tuesday to refrain from publishing supposed texts unless they were released by the constitutional committee.  Resumption of talksThe Sunnis agreed on Monday to resume work on the committee after they walked out in protest and cited security as one of the reasons.  Sunnis had walked out in protestciting security as one of the reasons  Sunni Arab support is crucial because the charter can be scuttled if voters in three of Iraq's 18 provinces reject it by a two-thirds majority - and Sunni Arabs are reportedly a majority in four provinces.US officials are anxious for the Iraqis to meet the 15 August deadline as a major step in building a stable, constitutional Iraqi government.If the deadline is met, voters will decide whether to approve the charter in mid-October and if they go, another general election will take place in December.

These days, many are upgrading to a bigger order, as many as 15 wings and a soda.  The larger plates are a sign customers are OK about spending a little more. The evidence may not be a major economic report, but small businesses have their own indicators the economy is improving. For example:  People who held onto their jobs during the recession are familiar with the scenarios. The company doughnuts disappeared from the meetings. Training classes that included lunch were traded in for brown-bag sessions.   201cBring your own bagel into the meeting 2019 2019 was the message, said Tom Walter. His company, Tasty Catering in Elk Grove Village, Ill., caters for corporate clients.  When companies did serve food, they cut costs, Walter said. Turkey and brie on artisan breads were replaced by turkey and Swiss on whole wheat.  Last fall, things began to change. Four months ago, many clients had whittled down their catering bills to about $10 person. More recently that 2019s crept up to as much as $13 per person.  The increased spending isn 2019t just fueled by an improvement in his clients 2019 businesses, Walter says. Companies are worried about losing their best staffers,  201cso they 2019re giving their employees more rewards. 2019 2019  When the financial crisis hit in 2008, many companies stopped worrying about d 00e9cor like lobby plants and holiday displays. Sales fell 30 percent at Parker Cos., a Scotch Plains, N.J., company that does interior landscaping.  Hotels and office buildings that used to spend $30,000 for a holiday display were spending $8,0, said William Note, Parker 2019s creative director.  But in the last quarter of 2011, Note noticed many companies sprucing up. The number of proposals that Parker has written for customers this year is up 60 percent. But companies aren 2019t spending freely. Note says clients are choosier, asking companies like Parker to bid on projects - not the practice five years ago.  Note is trying to make impressive displays for less money.  201cI 2019m trying to be as creative with nothing as I possibly can, 2019 2019 he says.  At Hurricane Grill & Wings, people are also ordering more appetizers and entrees. President Martin O 2019Dowd said the average check per person at his company 2019s 45 restaurants in six states has risen 7 percent from a year ago.  O 2019Dowd said business began to pick up in the fourth quarter of last year. The improvement has enabled Hurricane Grill & Wings to hire more workers and increase the hours of current staffers. He 2019s optimistic that customers will keep spending more.  As they do, he expects them to splurging calorie-wise as well - he anticipates more orders of cheesecake and key lime pie.  For many women - and some men - keeping their eyebrows in perfectly arched shape is a weekly affair.  At least that was the way it was until the 2008 financial crash.  Around that time, Reema Khan, who started her Cerritos, Calif.-based s.h.a.p.e.s Brow Bar salons in 2003, noticed that women who had come in weekly started visiting less often.  Some of her female customers said they would take their grooming into their own hands. She estimated about 30 percent of her male customers continued to come in.  But lower traffic made it harder to sell additional services, such as facials and henna tattoos.  Before the recession, the average bill at s.h.a.p.e.s was $15 to $20. It dropped to $10. Khan said that some customers did not want to tip, which made for unhappy employees.  Business has picked up this year at the company, which has more than 65 locations in six states. Customers are again making appointments for facials and bikini waxes.  Valentine 2019s Day was a particularly good day.   201cWe didn 2019t expect it, but we were crazily busy, 2019 2019 Khan said. Summary: Some diners at Hurricane Grill & Wings had been limiting themselves to a small order of the chain 2019s saucy chicken wings and a glass of tap water. These days, many of those people are upgrading to a bigger order of as many as 15 wings and a soda. For Hurricane Grill, which sells its wings in more than 30 varieties of sauces, the larger plates and the sodas are a sign that customers are OK about spending a little more when they go out to eat. The evidence may not be a big economic report like gross domestic product or factory orders in a region, but small businesses have their own indicators that the economy is improving.",

            "input": "text:NASHUA  2014 Allan Galdamez decided that, this year, the turkey could wait.  On Thursday evening, the Waltham resident was the first person in line at Sears at the Pheasant Lane Mall here after arriving at 8 a.m. Thanksgiving morning. His plan: grab a 50-inch television for $299 and head home for a belated Thanksgiving dinner.   201cWe 2019re just going to get in and get it and get out, 201d he said.  The doors opened at 7:50 p.m. Ten minutes later Galdamez emerged successful.  Galdamez was among hundreds of people lined up outside Sears and Target in Nashua on Thursday, hoping to score the kinds of deals more typically offered up in the early hours of Friday morning.  Store openings on Black Friday, the traditional kickoff of the holiday shopping season, have crept earlier and earlier for the past several years. This year, major retailers across the country pushed up their start times even further, opening their doors to shoppers fresh from finishing off their pumpkin pie.  Massachusetts blue laws, however, prohibit most stores from opening on Thanksgiving, forcing eager shoppers to either wait until after midnight or drive to a neighboring state to score the best deals. And many did; at least half of the cars parked at Pheasant Lane Mall on Thursday evening sported Massachusetts license plates.  Nationally, 17 percent of consumers  2014 some 41 million people  2014 planned to shop on Thursday, according to a survey by the International Council of Shopping Centers, a trade group, and investment bank Goldman Sachs. Walmart, one of the retailers that opened stores on Thanksgiving, estimated that about 22 million shopped at its stores on Thursday.  For Chelmsford resident Carol Mehigan, who was waiting for the doors to open at Sears, hitting the mall is no different than any other form of Thanksgiving night entertainment.   201cThe guys are at home watching football  2014 we can shop, 201d said Mehigan, who was hoping to buy a discounted television for her oldest grandson.  Galdamez wished that a store closer to home  2014 somewhere in Massachusetts  2014 had been open and offering the same deals.  The Retailers Association of Massachusetts has called on state policy makers to consider allowing shopping on Thanksgiving to help local retailers compete with online competitors and those in other states. Massachusetts is one of three New England state that prohibit shopping on Thanksgiving, rules based on 17th-century blue laws. The other states are Maine and Rhode Island. Summary: Massachusetts blue laws prohibit most stores from opening on Thanksgiving, forcing eager shoppers to either wait until after midnight or drive to a neighboring state to score the best deals. Sears and Target stores in the Pheasant Lane Mall in Nashua, N.H. opened Thursday evening and at least half of the cars in the parking lot had Massachusetts license plates.",

This year he released  201cCatbirds Say Yeah 201d with the Catbirds,  201cThis Is What Bears Look Like Underwater 201d with the Three-O (a quartet, no less), and is gearing up for three stagings of his annual Christmas Cavalcade concerts, which will bring in the Philharmonic and many of Travis 2019s musical allies.  Travis calls himself a human monkey wrench in the sense that he is happy gumming up the system and defying expectations. He knows that can be counterintuitive from a business standpoint  2014 releasing two very different albums so close together was probably not helpful to either project he says  2014 but artistically, Travis is just following the lead of the people who inspired him.   201cIt 2019s like Dylan coming up with a whole new voice for a record, 201d Travis says.  201cOr Paul McCartney. You listen to  2018Lady Madonna 2019 and you go, where 2019d that guy come from? 201d  Travis first gained notice in the  201970s playing with Steve Shook in Travis, Shook and the Club Wow before forming the Incredible Casuals in 1980. The Casuals became a Cape Cod institution, performing every Sunday for 32 years at the Beachcomber in Wellfleet, where the band delivered a good-humored blend of primal rock  2019n 2019 roll spiced with R&B. The Casuals no longer hit the Beachcomber every Sunday, but instead show up there about four times a season amid other gigs.  Travis says he piled up songs that didn 2019t fit well with the Casuals, and those paved the way to the Philharmonic 2019s configuration with horns, keys, and mandocello. Of course, the sprawl of the Philharmonic posed its own problems, especially in finding venues big enough for the nine-piece band. A few years ago, when offers came for some smaller gigs, the Three-O was born with Travis setting up a band with the Philharmonic 2019s bassist John Clark, multi-instrumentalist Berke Mc-Kelvey, and singer Fred Boak.  Around the time the Three-O came into shape, Travis also cooked up the Catbirds, a band that makes a glorious racket of jittery rock  2019n 2019 roll of the sort teenagers make after hearing  201cMy Generation 201d for the first time. Except in this case, these  201cteens 201d have a few decades of solid work under their belts, with Steve Wood playing unbridled electric guitar, Philharmonic cohort Dinty Child switching between guitar, mandocello, and accordion, Rikki Bates on drums, and Travis on bass.   201cThis is a band where I get to play like I did when I started playing, 201d says Bates, who first started working with Travis 35 years ago in Travis, Shook and the Club Wow and carried on into the Casuals, the Philharmonic, and now the Catbirds.  201cI like to hit the drums hard. 201d (No kidding; Bates busted a bass drum during a recent Catbirds show at Johnny D 2019s.)  Bates also likes the breadth of work Travis presents. With the Catbirds, Bates drums in the moment, maybe tossing in an extra half-beat that triggers a response from the guitar and so on; in the Philharmonic, it 2019s all about nailing the precision and nuance of the songs.  Boak, who went from diehard Casuals fan, to band 2019s merch guy ( 201cI was at all of the shows anyway 201d) to Travis 2019s  201cvalet 201d in the Philharmonic, to eventually becoming a full-fledged Three-O singer, echoed a point also made by Bates: Travis makes sure to tend to the details in his songs.  JOSH REYNOLDS FOR THE BOSTON GLOBE  Chandler Travis leading the Catbirds in a recent set at Johnny D 2019s in Somerville.   201cChandler can do all of these interesting chord things and have a good hook, 201d Boak says.  201cHe understands the concept of the hook. 201d  And Travis takes the hook wherever it needs to go.   201cI love Christmas music, 201d he says, noting his four albums of holiday music and 26 years of annual compilations he 2019s made for friends.  201cI 2019m just fascinated by a holiday not only with its own music, but one that is so aggressive about it. 201d  And the Christmas Cavalcades are Travis 2019s showcase for all that is good about the seasonal songs, especially those that capture the opposing forces of joy and despair unleashed in December.  The 8th or 9th Annual Christmas Cavalcade to Benefit the Homeless happens Dec. 13 at Johnny D 2019s in Somerville and features the Chandler Travis Philharmonic, Livingston Taylor, Jenny Dee and the Deelinquents, Barrence Whitfield, Jennifer Kimball, Vance Gilbert, the Catbirds, Ray Mason, Erin Harpe and the Delta Swingers, the Jessica Schroeder Dancer, Miriam, Shaun Wortis, Bird Mancini, Aaron Spade, Kami Lyle, the Darlings, the Second Line Social Aid and Pleasure Society Brass Band, the Philharmonic Trombone Shout Band, and the Athol Thingerth. All proceeds from the show will go to the Somerville Homeless Coalition.  The Cavalcade then stops into the Wellfleet Harbor Actors Theater on Dec. 15 and presents the Three-O, Sarah Swain and the Swain Sisters, Christine Rathbun, Fred Magee, Robertchez, and the Trees.  The second Cape Cod Christmas Cavalcade happens Dec. 16 at the Jailhouse Tavern in Orleans and features the Chandler Travis Philharmonic, the Ticks, Siobhan Magnus, the Rip-It-Ups, Tripping Lily, Bruce Maclean, Kate & Tad from Sidewalk Driver, the Catbirds, Steve Shook, Christine Rathbun, Fred Fried, Carla Kihlstedt & Matthias Bossi, Jay Cournoyer, Sarah Burrill, Sarah Swain & the Swain Sisters, Kami Lyle, Lydia Parkington, Stephen Russell, Toast & Jam, and the Athol Thingerth. Both of the Cape shows benefit the Noah Shelter of Hyannis.  No matter which Cavalcade you hit, count on hearing nothing but Christmas tunes  2014 some originals, some vintage, some out of left field (there 2019s usually a lot of dibs on Robert Earl Keene 2019s  201cMerry Christmas From the Family 201d).  Then after the holiday, Travis will likely get back to feeding his bands.   201cI write whatever pops into my head.

So, we came here to the netherlands, crisscrossed by canals and sitting below sea level where people live under the constant t of flooding. We had heard a modern-day noah had done something extraordinary.  266a thanks for having us to your ark. To be frank, I never thought I'd say that to anybody. He built himself is own biblical So that was a rooster? It was a rooster. So what animals have you got in your ark? Plastic animals. Not quite like noah. Yeah, no. He had real animals. In fact, it was a real flood that inspire d mr. Huibers, a born again christian to build this ark. He nearly drowned in a storm surge in 1992 and the next day a book caught his eye among the wreckage. It was a big book, the ark of noah, I bought it and we are looking at the book and I said, wow, I'm going to build the ark of noah. My children were excited and they run to my wife. What did your wife say? She was not happy with it. Women are sensible. Yeah. It took 13 years to get permission. It took you 13 years to convince her? Exactly. You must have really believed inthis. 100%. It took him just over four years to build his ark and he even used the bible as a blueprint. 50 elbow is the width and -- when you say elbow? From here. Cubit? I took my cubit, nobody knows how big noah was at that time. According to the bible, noah spent 120 years on his ark. And it's every child's favorite story when the flood finally did come he was ready. God sends two of every animal, all of them, two of every single one. Came on to a ship from the giraffe to ants to bears. Rained for 40 days and 40 nights. And finally the whole entire earth was flooded. Adam is 17 years old and as fantastic as the noah story sounds, even tonight, not far from 's home in new york, people are still trying to cope with the aftermath of hurricane sandy. And it seems that whether it was seven weeks ago in the united states or 7,000 years ago when a wave washes away the home that you built that children and the community you love, the first question we all ask is why. Life often seems inexplicable and we need to make sense of it. We need something that will help you to assuage your grief and anguish and rage. These biblical stories are a way of finding meaning. When I was younger, the story was kind of a fairy tale for me. I think that when you get older, you kind of see the sad nas and the sorrow in the story. Because lots of people die in this flood. Destroying the earth, the bible tells us, is the only thing god ever regrets so he sends a rainbow as a promise. This rainbow shows that god will never send a flood again to hurt humanity and all of the animals that live on this earth. What happens next is left out of the colorful pages of storybooks. Noah comes out of the ark and he plants a vineyard and gets drunk. I was remembering a story of a holocaust survivor whot home to his village and found everyone had gone. He said I could understand exactly why noah got drunk. If you imagine what it would have been like after the flood. Devastation, all of the swollen, bloated bodies around. Terrible. And it turns out the flood stories like this are not unique to the bible. They can be found all over the ancient world. These stories didn't drop from heaven one day in a clump of words all sent by god in book form. These stories developed in a certain place and time. Leading some archaeologists to believe they are based on real events. People do not make these things up. So, does this mean we've got a flood back, way back in antiquity? It may well. The story is created to explain something that happened. But in the biblical account the story is layered with new meaning. The flood is sent as a punishment for people's sins. Hurricane katrina was the judgment of god. I don't know how much god has to do we had an earthquake and hurricane, he said are you agoing to start listening to me here? You know even today some christians will say that the tsunamis and the floods are retribution from god for since committed today. Some christians say that. I don't know on what basis they would say it. In the world sometimes god allows things to happen, it doesn't mean he's judging people. But johann isn't so sure. Do you believe he'll do it again? World one not anymore but small ones. Small places might be wiped away. Like new york. Not a small place. Big, big disaster that time. Does that frighten you? Yeah. I'so the promise of god that it is in his hands. I feel like the moral of the story, for me, helping others will make the world a better place. And a better place for myself will be a better place for everyone. And for my children and for xhiemy children's children and that's the kind of world I want to live noah tells us about.

            "input": "text:(MoneyWatch) Most likely, you've seen how stocks have been clobbered over the past few days. The S&P 500 index has dropped almost 8 percent since its May 21 close of 1,669, the highest of the year. Bonds haven't been immune to tough market conditions either, with yields soaring in recent weeks. The 10-year and 30-year Treasury yields ended April at 1.70 percent and 2.88 percent respectively. Yesterday, they closed at 2.57 percent and 3.66 percent, respectively.  However, what you may not have seen are some of the positives we've been experiencing lately. My almost 20 years of providing advice to individual investors have taught me that it's relatively easy to stay the course when things are going well, but we tend to stray from the disciplined and winning strategy of buy, hold and rebalance when things get rough. This is why it's important to see both sides -- the whole picture helps investors to stay the course. Here are some of the positives to keep in mind.  The housing industry is rapidly improving. Home prices jumped a whopping 12.1 percent in the past year, according to the S&P Case-Shiller composite index. The supply of homes for sale in most markets is now below normal levels. That's creating bidding wars in some markets. And even if interest rates were to rise a further 1 percent, they would still be well below historical averages.  The steep rise in the yield curve is a boon to banks. Along with the strong housing market and an improving economy, this should be very positive for profits. Given that housing and banking were at the epicenter of the financial crisis, investors should welcome the news that these sectors are doing well.  Environmental concerns aside, the new fracking industry has caused a significant revitalization in U.S. energy production. Natural gas production is up about 30 percent since 2005.  The unemployment rate ticked up slightly from April to May, but it was still down 0.6 percent from one year ago. Forty-two states saw decreases in their unemployment rates over the same one-year period.  In most cases, state and local governments have taken strong actions to strengthen their fiscal situations. Another major concern has faded: Meredith Whitney's forecast of hundreds of billions in municipal defaults is now a distant memory.  The U.S. government's deficit is coming in well below forecasts thanks in part to the housing boom, which is driving record profits for the now-government-owned Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Other bailout programs are also generating profits.  Overall corporate profits continue to be strong. Economist Edward Yardeni reports that the current full year operating earnings forecast for the S&P 500 Index is expected to come in at around $111. With the S&P 500 closing at 1,573 yesterday, that's a forward-looking price-earnings ratio of about 14.1, or a little more than the historical average. Stocks certainly don't look expensive -- even if forward-looking estimates are notoriously optimistic.  Despite all the concerns about the Federal Reserve's easy monetary policy, M2 (a broad measure of the money supply) has grown at a rate of less than 5 percent over the past three and six months and less than 7 percent over the past 12 months. The market certainly doesn't expect to see any sign of an inflation threat on the horizon, as the breakeven inflation rate on 10-year TIPS is only about 2 percent. And the current consensus forecast of professional economists is for a 10-year inflation rate of just 2.3 percent. Since the market's estimate of inflation has not risen, the sharp rise in interest rates has been caused by a rise in the real rate.  Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's statements about the tapering of the quantitative-easing program was accompanied by the caveat that it would be carried out only if the economy continued to improve and that he fully expected that the Fed would continue its policy of zero interest rates well into next year. In fact, he indicated that the Fed would continue that policy until the unemployment rate fell to perhaps 6 percent, a lower figure than previously indicated.  The bottom line is that we saw the stock market fall sharply because of concerns about rising interest rates. However, the rise in rates was based on a stronger economic outlook, which is good for corporate profits, which in turn are ultimately what drives the stock market. It wasn't based on a rising inflation outlook, which would be negative for stocks.  Of course, I don't want to mislead you by presenting a one-sided picture. As is always the case, there are plenty of negatives to worry about -- if you think that would be a valuable use of your time:  But it's important to understand that if you know about these issues, so does the rest of the market. And that's why the market is selling at only about 13.5 times expected earnings. In other words, it's not that the market has to go down because of the negatives. It's that it would be a lot higher if the negatives weren't there.  So what should you do about all this information? Assuming you have a well-developed investment plan, you should do nothing, as your plan should have anticipated that environments like this would occur. If you don't have a plan, I suggest you go pick up a copy of  The Only Guide You'll Ever Need to the Right Financial Plan,  read it and then develop, write and sign your plan. And then have the wisdom and discipline to stay the course. Summary: Recent volatility in the markets may have sent the anxiety index soaring among investors, but their worries are unfounded",

            "input": "text:FRANKFURT  2014 The European Central Bank on Thursday kept interest rates unchanged as it weighed the risk of ultra-low inflation to Europe 2019s tentative recovery.  The bank, which sets monetary policy for the 18-nation eurozone, in November surprised the markets by cutting its benchmark rate to 0.25 percent  2014 a record low  2014 from 0.5 percent.  Economists had not expected the bank to act Thursday, but they said they believe there is a significant chance it will act in coming months to guard against falling prices.  A report Tuesday by Eurostat, the European Union 2019s statistics agency, showed the eurozone inflation rate falling to 0.8 percent in December, far below the ECB 2019s target for keeping price increases to just under 2 percent. It was low enough to raise fears that Europe could be on the verge of an across-the-board decline in the general price level.  Mario Draghi, president of the ECB, has warned about the danger of an inflation rate that gets entrenched below 1 percent, creating the sort of situation that caused Japan 2019s  201clost decade 201d of poor growth and economic pain. But on Thursday, Draghi dismissed the significance of the inflation data, calling it an expected reflection of lower inflation in the services part of the European economy.  Yet with the region 2019s unemployment rate stuck at 12.1 percent since April, the pressure will continue on the central bank to act. Draghi acknowledged that a worsening of inflation or a tightening of money-market rates could be triggers for further moves by the central bank.   201cThe recovery is there, but it 2019s weak and it 2019s fragile, 201d Draghi said, referring to recent signals of growth in the eurozone.  With interest rates, the traditional lever of monetary policy, already effectively at zero, the ECB might have to find other means of stimulating the economy. The region emerged from recession in the second quarter of 2013, and the central bank expects anemic economic growth of 1.1 percent this year.  Despite the cheap money, credit is not getting through to companies and households. The central bank said last week that lending to businesses in the eurozone shrank 3.9 percent in November from a year earlier, the biggest decline it has ever recorded.  The ECB could offer more cheap, long-term loans under the condition that banks lend to businesses. Another option is to penalize financial institutions for depositing funds at the ECB by offering negative deposit rates, spurring them to put more money into the economy.  US Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew urged European leaders  2014 particularly in Germany  2014 to focus on domestic demand. US officials believe it is essential that Europe act to pick up slack in the world economy as the Federal Reserve begins reducing its economic stimulus this month. Summary: The European Central Bank on Thursday kept interest rates unchanged, as it weighs the risk of ultralow inflation to Europe 2019s tentative recovery. The central bank, which sets monetary policy for the 18-nation eurozone, in November surprised the market by cutting its benchmark rate to 0.25 percent  2014 a record low  2014 from 0.5 percent. Economists had not expected the bank to act Thursday, but they said they believe that there is a significant chance it will act again in the coming months to guard against falling prices.

            "input": "text:The mayor 2019s first appointment to the Boston Redevelopment Authority board, Theodore Landsmark, was dismissed as president of Boston Architectural College last week, according to people briefed on the matter.  Landsmark, a lawyer who holds three degrees from Yale University and a doctorate from Boston University, is credited with launching programs and helping to expand the college he led for 17 years. But the college 2019s board of trustees voted to let him go as the school faces mounting challenges.   201cWe have been facing greater financial challenges and shrinking enrollment, and we felt it was better for the college to seek new leadership to face these challenges, 2019 2019 said Marc W. Pelletier, the college 2019s board chairman.  City Hall officials said Mayor Martin J. Walsh had not been aware of Landsmark 2019s termination.  201cThis was news to the Mayor today, 201d spokeswoman Kate Norton said via e-mail late Tuesday.  201cWe learned of this development through contact from the Globe. The Mayor has reached out to Dr. Landsmark directly but they have not been in contact as of yet. 201d  Landsmark,68, said his lawyers were negotiating an ongoing role for him at the college.   201cIt 2019s a very amiable conversation, 201d he said.  Pelletier confirmed the college 2019s decision was made Thursday. On Friday, the school posted a letter from Pelletier on its website, announcing Landsmark was  201cending his tenure as president 2019 2019 immediately.  Pelletier said the BRA appointment  201ccame as a total surprise to the entire school here. 201d  In a news release issued earlier Tuesday, Walsh had highlighted Landsmark 2019s credentials, including his roles on numerous nonprofit boards, such as at the American Architectural Foundation and the New England Foundation for the Arts. In the 1980s and 1990s, he served in Boston city government, working on employment and antiviolence programs.   201cTed has proven to be an insightful leader who possesses a great sense for what goes into building successful cities, 201d Walsh said in the press release.  201cHis dedication to public service has inspired countless others, and I 2019m excited by the fresh perspective and ideas he will bring to the board. 201d  If confirmed by the City Council, Landsmark would fill the sole vacancy on the five-member BRA board. It meets monthly and is responsible for voting on all final agreements at the authority, including planning studies, rezoning initiatives, and project permitting.  Landsmark holds a place in Boston history, as the man being jabbed with an American flag during the antibusing riots in 1976, when he was a young civil rights activist. A Boston Herald-American photo of the episode won the Pulitzer Prize.  In the mayor 2019s press release, Landsmark said:  201cI share Mayor Walsh 2019s priorities for making the BRA more open and accountable, and I am honored by the opportunity to help guide the agency into a new era. I look forward to applying my knowledge of architecture, design, and sound fiscal management in shaping the future of development in our city. 201d  The college chairman credits Landsmark with leading  201cthe transformation of BAC from a center into an accredited college that today offers eight baccalaureate and master 2019s degree programs 2019 2019 to 900 students. Landsmark also worked to expand online offerings, the letter said, and is a recognized advocate for diversity. He said the board was talking to Landsmark about  201cplaying a future role at BAC. 201d  Provost Julia Halevy was named acting president.

            "input": "text:The paralysis that has gripped regional grocery powerhouse Market Basket should be a tremendous windfall for its supermarket rivals  2014 if only they could take advantage of it.  The thousands of loyal Market Basket customers who are now flooding nearby Hannaford, Stop & Shop, Star Market, and Shaw 2019s supermarkets bring to those stores not just a huge surge in sales but also thorny business and public relations challenges.   201cIt sounds easy: One of your competitors is imploding, their customers have to buy groceries, how do you attract them? But it 2019s harder than it sounds, 201d said Sean Willems, an associate professor at Boston University who studies operations management.  201cBeyond all the human drama, there is a fascinating business problem here. 201d  Three of the region 2019s main supermarkets each acknowledged that business at many of their stores has picked up substantially since July, when Market Basket employees and customers began boycotting the company 2019s stores to force the rehiring of popular president Arthur T. DeMoulas.  But representatives of Hannaford, Shaw 2019s Star Market, and Stop & Shop declined to comment in detail on the Market Basket boycott. Indeed, the chains have either been cautious in their public statements or said little at all.  Analysts said the rival supermarkets have to be careful not to be seen as capitalizing on the controversy.  Moreover, they are limited in making quick changes, such as offering special discounts or new products, because supermarkets typically lock into their current inventory weeks ahead of time.  Their first and foremost problem is logistical: Many of their stores are now mobbed, and they need extra food and staff to keep both their new and existing customers satisfied.  A few supermarkets have barely kept up with the new business from former Market Basket customers. Customers have posted pictures on social media sites showing empty shelves at some stores after the crush of shoppers defecting from Market Basket.  Kevin Griffin, publisher of the Griffin Report on Food Marketing, said the rivals are in a difficult position.   201cThey 2019re not coming apart, 201d Griffin said.  201cBut they can 2019t get the help, they can 2019t get the stores stocked fast enough, and it means they can 2019t service customers how they 2019d like to. 201d  The chains said they deployed contingency plans normally used during blizzards or hurricanes, when shoppers make a mad dash to stores to stock up on essentials, and brought in additional supplies and personnel. But that, too, entails some risk, since it is unclear when  2014 or if  2014 the crisis at Market Basket would abate and shopping life would return to normal.  Governor Deval Patrick took part in negotiations Sunday night to help end the DeMoulas standoff, which has crippled Market Basket stores and put thousands of people out of work, according to two people familiar with the matter.  One reason why Market Basket commands such loyalty among shoppers is that the prices are often much lower than at competitors.  Now, unhappy with the prices at rival chains, some Market Basket shoppers are taking to social media to trash the competition, while pining for their neighborhood Market Basket stores.  Online, customers call Hannaford  201cCan 2019tAfford, 201d or post pictures of barren refrigerators they say are empty because of high prices at Stop & Shop or Shaw 2019s.  Richard Nicolazzo, who runs the Boston public relations and communications firm Nicolazzo & Associates, said the rival supermarkets are wise to not respond to such criticism.   201cThere has been an amazing and emotional expression of brand loyalty to Market Basket that goes way beyond common sense and reason, 201d he said.   201cI would let it lie. You cannot make sense out of nonsense, and a lot of this is nonsensical. 201d  Of the major chains, only Shaw 2019s would respond to the sniping from the Market Basket faithful.   201cWe 2019re all feeling the same balance of folks who are appreciative and folks who are upset they can 2019t shop where they want to shop, 201d said Shaw 2019s spokesman Jeffrey Gulko.  Otherwise, cautious is the prevailing tone among Market Basket competitors.   201cWe have seen many new shoppers in our stores in recent weeks, 201d Stop & Shop said in a statement.  201cWe hope that these new shoppers continue to shop with us. 201d  Chief among their fears, analysts theorized, is that a single statement interpreted by Market Basket loyalists as insensitive could bring a stinging backlash.   201cThere 2019s been this kind of general theory that it would be improper for a competing supermarket to take out ads that say,  2018Welcome, Market Basket shoppers! 2019  201d said Edgar Dworsky, a consumer advocate who runs ConsumerWorld.org .  201cThere 2019s a worry that people will ask,  2018Whose side on you are on? 2019  201d  Cutting prices is also a sensitive issue. While the chains said they endeavor to keep prices competitive, they noted that many products are typically priced and ordered long before they appear on shelves.  And without a drastic rewriting of strategy, it would be difficult for a higher-margin supermarket chain to suddenly emulate the discount Market Basket model, which relies on sales volume.   201cOur ads and prices are set out weeks in advance, 201d said Gulko, the Shaw 2019s spokesman.  201cNo one really knew what kind of impact [the disruption to Market Basket] would have when it started. 201d  Others, however, questioned whether the competition is in any rush to lower prices. After all, where else would Market Basket shoppers get their groceries?   201cYou don 2019t have to lower your prices when you 2019re the only game in town, 201d Dworsky said.  Several weeks into the crisis, analysts said, the competitors appear to be holding their own under the circumstances.  And while the nature of grocery shopping means the stores will have multiple chances to try to win over Market Basket shoppers, the companies will be able to bend only so far to please.   201cYou 2019re not going to be changing your business model. You 2019re trying to make temporary accommodations while converting as many people as you can into regular shoppers, 201d Griffin said.   201cYou 2019ve got to win customers one at a time. I 2019d say the opportunity outweighs the risk, and hopefully you can seize that and make the most of it. 201d Summary: For rival supermarket chains, the sudden, self-imposed exile of thousands of shoppers who were once fanatically loyal to Market Basket is an unprecedented chance to grab a bigger slice of the habit-driven grocery segment. But they are at pains not to sound like they are profiting from the misery of others.

High-powered supercomputers can crack many of today 2019s standard encryptions, and those encryption schemes that aren 2019t breakable now will become so in the future as the speed and power of supercomputers continue their ever-accelerating uptick.  In other words, even the best standard encryption that 2019s considered unbreakable today will be vulnerable at some point in the future  2014 likely the near future. That 2019s one reason agencies like the NSA are building massive server farms in the Utah desert on which to bank encrypted data that they can 2019t yet decipher. And it 2019s why Battelle and its partners at Swiss quantum technology outfit ID Quantique are investing heavily in a new encryption scheme that they see as the future of high-value data security.  MORE: Zeroing in on unbreakable computer security   201cWe 2019re a contract R&D organization, so we have a lot information we want to protect, 201d says Don Hayford, a senior research leader at Battelle.  201cWe started looking about three years ago into network security in general, and we could see that things like RSA-1024 [a commonly used 1,024-bit encryption key] has probably been broken, some of the other public-key infrastructure technologies maybe haven 2019t been broken yet but will soon be broken by bigger, stronger, faster computers. So we weren 2019t just looking at our security, but at the country in general. What 2019s going to happen when these things are all falling apart? 201d  QKD stood out to Battelle 2019s researchers as the best technically feasible means of generating secure encryption that wasn 2019t just a solution that works now and that won 2019t leave data exposed in the future. But QKD also has some drawbacks, including a limited range and potential difficulties in sharing keys. So Battelle turned to ID Quantique, a Geneva-based quantum technology company with extensive experience in quantum communications, to help smooth out those issues.  QKD works by tapping some of quantum physics 2019 stranger phenomena to make it virtually impossible for a third party to steal an encryption key without sender and receiver being aware. Using a standard encryption algorithm, the sender encrypts the data and transmits it to the receiver. But instead of sending along the key by conventional means, it is encoded into a single photon  2014 the elementary particle of light  2014 which is then placed into a correlated state with a second photon. Physicists call this  201centanglement 201d (Einstein called it  201cspooky 201d) and under the laws that govern the quantum world any attempt to observe or measure one photon affects the other correlated photon regardless of whether they are in the same room or on opposite sides of the planet.  The key-encoded photon is then beamed through a standard fiber cable to the receiver who can use the key to decrypt the data. If any third party should somehow be able to get between send and receiver on the network at just the right moment to trap a single photon moving at the speed of light (an unlikely prospect), any attempt by the third party to observe or measure the encoded photon would alert the sender because it would also affect the correlated photon that is still in the sender 2019s possession. And because the third party can 2019t surreptitiously copy the key and hold onto it for later, the user doesn 2019t have to worry about some future supercomputer breaking the code at a later date.  That all sounds a bit complex  2014 and even sci-fi  2014 but the science is readily understood. Its application has grown increasingly practical in recent years, and the technologies necessary to encode and entangle photons have improved and become somewhat less costly. But drawbacks remain, Hayford says; single photons tend to lose their coherence beyond a range of 60 to 120 miles, depending on the quality of the fiber network. And while it 2019s easy to send a photon from point A to point B, it can be relatively difficult to share keys over networks that require many senders and receivers (like a regional bank with 300 branches that all need to share data with each other, for instance.)  MORE: Can Silicon Valley boot camps get you a $120K job?  For a country as large as the U.S., those limitations present a problem, but that isn 2019t stopping Battelle and ID Quantique from pressing on. Battelle plans to extend its Ohio network into a ring around Columbus linking the multiple buildings that make up its headquarters. Along with ID Quantique it is developing so-called quantum repeaters that will mitigate the range limitation by periodically receiving and re-transmitting photons as they make their journey across the network, like signal boosters on a standard optical network.  Those quantum repeaters should be ready by 2015, when Battelle plans to link its Ohio HQ to its facilities in Washington, D.C. across a secure quantum network stretching more than 400 miles. That long-distance quantum network will be the first step in making QKD truly feasible across the larger U.S., Hayford says, and could mark the nascent beginnings of a nationwide rollout of truly secure network technology.   201cI don 2019t know that everyone will [adopt QKD], but I do think that companies and organizations that have very high-value data will, 201d Hayford says.  201cIf it 2019s short-term data or low-value data, then who cares? But if it 2019s data that you want to protect for years, this makes a lot sense. I think you 2019ll see this distributed across the country to protect that high-value, long-duration data. We think this is the future. Summary: The first quantum key distribution network in the United States promises un-hackable data security.",

Skowron missed a 36-yard field goal in the final seconds of a 28-26 loss to USC on Saturday, as Arizona suffered its first loss of the season.  In the immediate aftermath, several fans took to social media to thrash the walk-on kicker. One said:  i hope your entire family dies of cancer you (expletive).  Another added:  I hope you get ebola.    It's never down to one (play),  Rodriguez said Tuesday night after the Wildcats' first practice since the loss at Arizona Stadium.  It's crazy for somebody to take it overboard.   He added that he's  glad people care. It's better than apathy, I guess.   Skowron was not made available to the media on Tuesday, but did take to Twitter after practice:  Arizona athletic director Greg Byrne tweeted after the game:  Arizona quarterback Anu Solomon, like many teammates, have voiced their support for Skowron, saying one play wasn't the issue. About 50 seconds of game time before the field goal miss, the Wildcats failed on a game-tying two-point conversion on a handoff to Jared Baker. Solomon probably had a better play if he made a different read and kept the ball.   I partake in the blame, partially my fault for not scoring and not finishing our drives,  Solomon said.  Even on that two-point conversion. Would have, could have, should have. You just gotta learn from it.   Skowron, a junior, had made 11 of 13 field goal attempts heading into the USC game, but was just 2 of 5 vs. USC.  Rodriguez said his players deserve better than what Skowron got on social media.   Don't be ridiculous about it,  he said to those who posted negative comments.  Then Rodriguez offered up a challenge, maybe even a free education.   If you think you can do better,  he said,  and you have you college eligibility left and are a good enough student to get into U of A, please come out and we will try you out.   And by the way, yes, he said, Skowron will still be Arizona's kicker when the team plays at Washington State on Oct. 25.

Before that social experiment, U.S. president Barack Obama held the record with his 2012 election victory tweet, which notched more than 780,000 retweets. The pattern, of course, is an extremely shareable image.  Which is why it makes sense for Twitter to roll out new features allowing users to post up to four photos and tag up to 10 people while still allowing a full, 140-character tweet. Twitter isn 2019t new to photos, but the more robust new functionality, announced Wednesday, underscores the microblogging company 2019s concession to move beyond its pithy, conversational structure and experiment with images, which have captivated social media companies (from Snapchat to Secret) as of late.  Recent rumors have stirred chatter of Twitter ditching its signature @ symbol and hashtags. The company 2019s head of news partnerships, Vivian Schiller, added to the speculation when she pointed to the antiquated tagging system and described the possibility of  201cmoving the scaffolding of Twitter into the background. 201d  The new photo functionality is designed to simplify tweets by losing the  201c@username 201d tagging system and instead allowing people to tag friends directly in photos, much like Facebook.

Limit that figure to smartphones and Twitter hit just 30.8 million in 2013.  The eight-year-old company has struggled with growth in the U.S., adding just 9 million monthly active users, or a 4% quarterly increase, in the last quarter of 2013, according to the company 2019s latest earnings report. Twopcharts, a website that focuses on Twitter account activity, reportedly found that only 11% of users who joined Twitter in 2012 are still active. Following a successful IPO last year, investors remain concerned about Twitter 2019s ability to grow its user base.

After acquiring Instagram in 2012, the social media giant launched Paper, an interactive, image-focused sharing application for mobile devices.

            "input": "text:Updated NOV 03, 2014 12:08a ET  WASHINGTON -- Shane Doan scored twice, and the Arizona Coyotes salvaged at least something from their road trip, snapping a three-game skid with a come-from-behind 6-5 win over the mistake-prone Washington Capitals on Sunday night.  The Coyotes trailed 3-1 after the first period, but power-play goals by Michael Stone and Doan tied it in the second before Sam Gagner and Doan capitalized on sloppy turnovers early in the third. Doan's second goal came after Washington's Alex Ovechkin -- who earlier broke a six-game goal drought -- completely whiffed trying to control the puck near the side boards in the Capitals' end.  Antoine Vermette tallied in the first period, and Tobias Rieder added his first NHL goal late in the third for the Coyotes, who had been outscored 12-4 in the first three games of their trip.  Mikkel Boedker assisted on both third-period goals, ending his streak of seven games without a point, and Devan Dubnyk made 32 saves.  Ovechkin and the mistake-prone Washington Capitals were embarrassed by the travel-weary Coyotes, prompting coach Barry Trotz to keep the locker room doors closed for a few extra minutes after the loss to deliver a grim message to his players.   Behavior has to change,  Trotz said.  Or we have to change people, plain and simple.   The Capitals' collective misbehavior allowed Washington to blow a two-goal, first-period lead by allowing five straight goals to a team that could have been forgiven for having one foot on the plane headed home.  The Coyotes, wrapping up a four-game road trip, had been outscored 12-4 in the first three games.  But there was breakdown after breakdown by the home team, and Ovechkin was often in the middle of it. He broke a six-game goal drought and had three assists, but he committed a crucial penalty that led to the Coyotes' tying goal in the second period and had a sloppy turnover that gave Arizona another score in the third.  He hasn't been the only culprit, for sure. The Capitals have lost four straight and allowed at least four goals each time.   Sometimes I get the feeling we want to play as hard as we just need to, and that's not how I operate,  said Trotz, who is in his first season with Washington.  That's not how you win in this league.   It's an old story -- already. It's too old for me.   Trotz was particularly upset by a sequence in the final minute of the second period. A needless icing forced him to take a timeout because his skaters were tired. Then came a high-sticking penalty on Ovechkin, although the call appeared to be a bit dubious. Shane Doan scored on the ensuing power play with 5 seconds left in the period to tie it at 3.   The commitment level has to be a little better than it is now in a lot of different areas,  defenseman Brooks Orpik said.  We have guys making mistakes that experienced guys shouldn't make.   Right now one guy makes a mistake and everybody else kind of watches it happen.   Trailing 3-1 after the first period, the Coyotes rallied with power-play goals by Michael Stone and Doan in the second before Sam Gagner and Doan capitalized on sloppy turnovers early in the third. Doan's second goal came after Ovechkin completely whiffed trying to control the puck near the side boards in the Capitals end.   We wanted to end the trip on a good note,  Arizona coach Dave Tippett said.  Things hadn't gone our way.   The Capitals managed to put together their own rally late after pulling goalie Justin Peters for an extra skater. Joel Ward scored on a power play with 1:53 remaining, and Troy Brower cut the deficit to one with 27 seconds remaining, but it wasn't enough.  Peters, getting his third start of the season ahead of Braden Holtby, stopped just 24 of 30 shots.  NOTES: Ovechkin ended his drought with a classic Ovechkin goal -- a one-timer from the left circle during a power play late in the first period. His six games without a goal had been his longest such streak since November 2011. His four points moved him into a tie with Peter Bondra (825) atop the franchise's career points list. ... Backstrom passed Dale Hunter (375) for fourth place on Washington's career assists list. ... The Coyotes won for the first time in six road games this season. Summary: Doan, Coyotes snap 3-game skid, beat Capitals 6-5.",

            "input": "text:After a year of losses, the exodus of investors from hedge funds hasn 2019t been as great as many expected. In the case of Eric Mindich 2019s $12 billion Eton Park Capital Management  2014 which fell about 11% last year  2014 that 2019s because try as they might, investors still have a hard time taking their money out.  Hedge funds loosened their terms after the carnage of 2008 alerted investors to the fact that funds weren 2019t required to return the investors 2019 cash just because they wanted it back. But Eton Park 2019s terms remain among the most onerous in the hedge fund world. And since its investors have hardly made a dime over the past three years, some are starting to bail. Net redemptions last year reached about 5% of fund assets, or around $700 million.  Mindich 2019s claim to fame is being the youngest person, at age 27, to make partner at Goldman Sachs GS in 1994. When he left to launch a hedge fund in 2004, the fever to invest with the wunderkind was so great that Mindich raised a record $3.5 billion despite insisting on one of the most stringent lockups on record.  Investors in a certain share class had to agree to keep the money in Eton Park for a minimum of 27 months, and it would take them another two years to get out, as they could only redeem one-third in any given year  2014 what 2019s called a rolling three-year lockup. If the investor missed the window of opportunity after the initial 27 months, he couldn 2019t try again for another 27. He also had to let Eton Park know 65 days ahead of time of his desire to exit the fund, and then would only receive his cash 30 days after the redemption date. The only way to get around these terms would be to pay a 6% early-exit penalty to the fund. And that wasn 2019t all: Eton Park also reserved the right to place up to 30% of the fund in side pockets; that money would be stuck there as long as the firm wanted.  The terms were egregious, but Mindich could demand them, and so he did. Such was the golden era for would-be hedge fund titans.  Cliff Asness: A hedge fund genius goes retail  These days, Eton Park 2019s lockup provisions look extreme, says Leon Mirochnik, research analyst with Trim Tabs, who thinks last year 2019s hedge fund redemptions weren 2019t as high as expected, in part, because lockups still exist at many of the more prestigious funds. One is hard-pressed to find one with terms as tough as Eton Park 2019s, especially given that the fund is largely invested in easily-marketable securities, not illiquid or private equity investments.  Mindich declined to comment. His spokesperson said fund 2019s terms are consistent with its long-term investment program.  As a result, Mindich 2019s Goldman patina is wearing thin, as is the patience of his investors. As of last July, Eton Park was the 20th largest U.S. hedge fund and managed $14 billion, according to the AR Billion Dollar Club. Much of the decline since then is due to poor performance. But Eton Park has also been raising money, which has kept the net outflows to about $700 million as of the end of December, according to an individual familiar with the firm.   201cWe are redeeming as much as we can and as fast as we can, 201d says one investor who invested in Eton Park in 2008. To those who signed on that year, Eton Park looked like a winner. In 2007 Mindich had his best year ever, gaining an estimated 35% to 40% based on the subprime shorts that drove returns for folks like John Paulson and Kyle Bass. Then in 2008, the year of the market 2019s freefall, Mindich impressed investors by losing a lot less than others: between 10% and 11%, depending on the share class.  The best and worst of Wall Street 2011: Hedge Funds  Eton Park raised about $2 billion in 2008, but all those investors have just about broken even, after paying fees. The end of 2011 marks the end of a three-stretch of lousy performance and bad market timing by Eton Park. Not only did it lose 11% last year  2014 far more than the average 5% among hedge funds and way below the S&P 500 2019s break-even performance  2014 the loss followed two dismal years. Mindich was bearish for much of 2009, so he missed the great rally, ending the year with a gain of an estimated 5%. He chalked up about 9% in 2010, but last year his bullishness led him to load up on financial stocks, which tanked.  Notably, he did worse than many of the funds whose founders also hailed from Goldman 2019s risk-arbitrage desk. Dan Och 2019s master fund was down .58%, Richard Perry 2019s Perry Capital International declined 7.57%, and Frank Brosen 2019s Taconic Capital event-driven fund fell 2.7%. Since inception in 2004, Eton Park has gained a little more than 7%, net of performance fees.  In 2010, Mindich tried to entertain investors by channeling his inner star with a mock interview between himself and Charlie Rose at the annual investor meeting. More noteworthy to investors, however, was his decision to trim the lockup period to 13 months, with the three-year rolling lock  2014 but only for brand new investors. The firm also introduced what it calls a  201clook back 201d period, which allows investors to change their mind and decide to take their money out 60 days after the required notice period. There 2019s a catch: Instead of taking out a third of the capital at that time, they can only take out a sixth.  Like many of the funds run by ex-Goldman partners, Eton Park is renowned for its solid infrastructure, designed to attract institutional money. That 2019s the kind of sticky money all hedge funds have been courting since 2008. It seems to be working. Last year, the industry ended November with $60.3 billion more in its coffers, despite the average 5% performance loss for the year, according to Trim Tabs. The net increase came entirely from direct investments, largely from pension funds, which plowed $69.7 billion into hedge funds through November. Such investors are notoriously slow to change investment allocations, and that might just be Eric Mindich 2019s salvation. Summary: Eric Mindich had investors clamoring when he launched his hedge fund Eton Park in 2004. Now they want their money back, and they 2019re finding it hard to get out.",

Americans spend more than $50 billion in sales during the Thanksgiving weekend, and competition has become stiff as consumers have had greater access to match prices offered at brick-and-mortar stores and online rivals. A number of retailers have responded by opening on Thanksgiving itself, when they realized they were losing out on precious sales as consumers took to their computers to shop after their Thanksgiving feasts.  But all of those efforts, as well as the famed  201cdoor busters 201d that generate headlines every year, could be falling on deaf ears.  A preliminary survey conducted on behalf of the National Retail Federation found that 140.1 million shoppers say they will or may shop at some point between Thursday to Sunday over Thanksgiving weekend.

The slight decline in Black Friday interest is a tad troublesome as retailers are in a pretty prime position this year. The economy has been growing, stocks are performing well and the nation 2019s employers have been adding more jobs. Gas prices are falling, a trend some retail executives have said could inspire greater spending, though food prices have risen and are eating a great chunk of consumer discretionary spending.  Online purveyors like Amazon.com AMZN appear well poised for the upcoming holiday season. Online sales are expected to rise between 8% to 11% in November and December this year, according to Shop.org forecasts.  NRF has said it is important for retailers to perform well this holiday season, especially after a volatile first half of the year due to some poor winter weather and a lackluster summer.   201cThe lagging economic recovery, though improving, is still top of mind for many Americans, 201d Shay said in a recent statement.

Sometimes there are ups and downs, rights and lefts, forwards and backwards. OpenTable OPEN took 11 years to go public. The goal is to take one or two steps forward every day, with the understanding that there will be setbacks. My favorite analogy is comparing entrepreneurship to mountain climbing in Antarctica. Successful climbers don 2019t dwell on the peak; they focus on the next 20 feet, and then the next, and then the next. Building a business takes time. You need to be able to weather the storms and take advantage of serendipity.  There 2019s no such thing as an expert  Listen to what mentors have to say, but remember that you are the only one building this business at this particular point in time. No example before you is an exact replica of your business. And just because something worked in the past, or didn 2019t work in the past, doesn 2019t mean that it will or won 2019t now. I don 2019t believe in experts. The idea that anyone (including me) is an expert is silly. There are people that know more than others about a particular topic, but often times the mentors you will encounter have a worldview that fits a particular time and business in history. But once things change, their view, which used to be insightful, will likely be obsolete. To me, many  201cexperts 201d are a product of a time. With that said, there 2019s obviously things you can learn from mentors, but their word is not gospel.  Don 2019t be a ping pong ball  Be open to feedback. Learn, but don 2019t be a ping pong ball. I prefer to work with entrepreneurs that have what I consider humble confidence. I like entrepreneurs that are somewhat self-effacing. They take feedback well and realize that while they are smart, they can 2019t do it alone. (And that some luck plays into everything.) With that said, entrepreneurs must evoke confidence. Again, they take feedback well but don 2019t bounce around on ideas. They have a point of view and they own. It 2019s their unique take on the world, and they are building their business around it.  Get out of the building  Always be action-oriented. Building a business isn 2019t about sitting around a white board and hypothesizing about what customers might want and how to grow your business. It 2019s about getting  201cout of the building 201d and interacting with customers. What do your customers actually want? How should you sell to them? If the problem or pain is big enough, they will buy an imperfect product. So get to a minimum viable product ASAP and find out who will pay and how much they will pay. Get your product into the wild and learn from your customers.  I say this so often that one of Impact Engine 2019s portfolio companies made me a shirt with this slogan on it. I like startups that are extremely focused on a single revenue model, a single customer segment, and a single solution, to start. Once you 2019re bigger, you can divert resources to more than one initiative, but in the beginning, it should be all about figuring out your revenue model and growth model. How do you make money: revenue model. How do you scale that money: growth model. I 2019ve seen several startups fail because they are trying to scale multiple sales models to multiple customer types.  Get as many  201cat bats 201d as possible. Most entrepreneurial efforts fail. And most of your ideas will also fail. The best way to increase your chances of success is to be alive as long as possible. The best way to do that is to be frugal. Benjamin Franklin talked about being frugal and industrious. So be wise with your money, but not in a way that suffocates growth. The longer you can stretch your runway, the more chances you have at bat. And hopefully one of those chances leads to a hit. My friend and entrepreneur Chris Gladwin says it so well,  201cto be in business you have to be in business. 201d Once you have the revenue model and growth model figured out and there is arbitrage in the business, then you can invest aggressively. Businesses have a natural rate of growth that capital can help accelerate, but at some point the marginal capital is wasted and inefficient.  Balance lean startup methodologies with being unreasonable. You have to be unbiased about your business. Do you really see it working? In orienteering, they call it  201cbending the map. 201d When you come upon a hill during a hike, you mark it with your compass to find it later. But when you try to find it on the map you get disoriented, and you trick yourself into believing that the hill you see on the map is also the hill you see in front of you. But deep down, you know that it 2019s not. Entrepreneurs can get caught in that trap as well. They know something isn 2019t right but they fool themselves into believing things are working. While you shouldn 2019t give up on your dreams, you need to be incredibly honest with the results you are seeing and adjust accordingly.  Think about the Adoption Curve (innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards). Look for the innovators in your space as the first (and possibly) most valuable customers. If their pain is big enough, they will take a suboptimal product, because for them, the problem is so painful that they need a solution immediately. They will be open and happy (for the short-term) with an MVP. They will also give you the benefit of the doubt as you continue to build out the product and bring on more (early adopters and early majority) customers. If you can 2019t find any innovators or early adopters that will use your MVP, then you are probably not solving a real problem.  Luck is always involved in entrepreneurship. No matter how hard you work, there will be some (good and bad) luck in it. Yes, luck favors the prepared and it is not all about luck. But when it comes along, recognize it and take advantage of it. And when you have bad luck, don 2019t feel sorry for yourself. Embrace it and get back out there. There will be setbacks. The only question is: how will you respond? Will you sulk and think  201cwhy me? 201d or will you bounce back and find a way to persevere? And remember, luck goes both ways. So if something happens in your favor, be thankful and embrace it. And don 2019t pat your back too hard or you may bruise yourself.  The buck stops with you  This is your company. Mentors and investors are here to help, but ultimately it is your business. If you want or need something, don 2019t be afraid to ask your supporters for help. But remember, the buck stops with you.  Chuck Templeton is the founder of OpenTable.

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday retail sales  2014 excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services  2014 fell 0.4% last month month after a 0.6% rise in November.  The so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Economists polled by Reuters had expected core retail sales to rise 0.4% last month.  December 2019s surprise decline could temper expectations that consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, accelerated sharply in the fourth quarter.  But with the labor market strengthening and gasoline prices continuing to fall, December 2019s decline in core retail sales will likely be temporary.  Indeed, the latest data show U.S. retail and food service sales leapt 4% in 2014, as an improving economy and job gains led more shoppers to open up their wallets to buy automobiles and furnishings to spruce up their homes.  The jump in retail sales was led by a strong 8.1% jump in sales of motor vehicle and parts sold by auto dealers, according to the Commerce Department report. Some top auto maker executives have already predicted sales will continue to climb in 2015.  Sales tied to the home were also strong: building material and garden equipment sales were up 5%, while furniture and home furnishing store sales leapt 3%. Housing prices have been climbing of late, albeit at a slower pace than in 2013, and home-improvement retail executives have said that when home prices appreciate, consumers are more willing to spend money for that new roof or refrigerator that they 2019ve been eyeing.

It has churned through the hiring and firing of top managers. Recently, investors have started to wonder if Dick Costolo, Twitter 2019s chief executive, is the right man for the job.  And 2015 is not looking so good, either.  On Thursday, the company reported revenue of $479 million in the fourth quarter, up 97 percent compared with $243 million a year ago and besting analyst expectations of $453 million.  But it was a faint glimmer of good news for the eight-year-old micromessaging service, which since its initial public offering in 2013 has been playing defense against shareholders who expect blockbuster quarterly results akin to those at Facebook, a far larger social media service.  Twitter said it had 288 million regular users on its platform, an addition of only 4 million people from the previous quarter and roughly one-fifth the number who visit Facebook on a monthly basis. It is a significant miss from analysts 2019 expectations of about 291 million regular users.  The company reported a loss of $125 million, or 20 cents a share, up from a loss of $500 million, or $1.41 a share, in the fourth quarter a year earlier. But using a measure of income that excludes stock-based compensation and other expenses, the company reported a profit of $79 million, or 12 cents a share, in the quarter, compared with a profit of $10 million a year before.  Analysts lowered their estimates for Twitter 2019s year-end quarter after Anthony Noto, recently appointed as chief financial officer, cautioned that continued changes in Twitter 2019s core product may cause the company 2019s metrics to fluctuate.  The real proof of change, some say, will be in the coming months.   201cTwitter is very much in its  2018prove it 2019 time period, and the results this quarter won 2019t prove it, 201d said Robert Peck, an analyst at the brokerage firm SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.  201cWhat we want to see: As we look into the first quarter, is Twitter going to see real traction from it for the rest of the year? 201d  For months, Twitter has been trying to prove that traction will come in a series of small yet significant changes over time.  It has promoted Kevin Weil, a well-regarded manager in its revenue division, to oversee all the company 2019s consumer and revenue products. Twitter has released a feature that allows users to take video inside its app, which will probably be a long-term source of ad revenue.  And on Thursday, Twitter announced a partnership with Google that will make the hundreds of millions of tweets that flow through the service every day much easier to find, using the world 2019s most popular search engine. Summary: Twitter reported revenue of $479 million in the fourth quarter, up 97 percent compared with $243 million a year ago and besting analyst expectations of $453 million.

And she succeeded, losing more than 100 lbs.  But that left her with folds of loose skin hanging down over her nether regions, known as an  apron.

His reputation began when he was 30 with the relief carving he did for the London Passenger Transport Board but did not take off until 20 years later, after he had won the sculpture prize at the 1948 Venice Biennale.  With his work now distributed around the globe in all but the newest and poorest countries, the artist may be said to have more than made up for lost time. Like the late and equally prolific Alexander Calder who also was born in 1898, Mr. Moore has become a full-blown institution. In some respects, it is his fame rather than his art that is being celebrated by an exhibition scheduled to open tomorrow at the Castle Gallery of the College of New Rochelle.  Though it includes a selection of lithographs and five maquettes by the master, the show focuses on about 50 photographs taken by David Finn in both black and white and color. A resident of New Rochelle, Mr. Finn is best known as the cofounder and board chairman of Ruder & Finn, a large international public relations firm with a style considered by some to be unbearably abrasive. The company is, however, one of the few of any consequence to operate in the arts field. It has made numerous matches between museums and corporate sponsors and numbers Philip Morris among its most prominent clients.  A widely published writer on the subjects of public relations and management, Mr. Finn is an amateur painter given to making sculpture out of paper clips. But for the last 10 years, he has been photographing the sculpture of others, notably Gustav Vigeland, Donatello and Michelangelo, exhibiting the results and publishing them in fairly sumptuous books. His most recent work is a study of Ghiberti's bronze doors for the Florence Baptistery, put out by Viking.  Most of the Moore photographs at the Castle Gallery appear in the fat volume - a 10-pounder, at a guess - ''Henry Moore, Sculpture and Environment,'' published in 1977 by Thames & Hudson. Introduced by Lord Kenneth Clark, the deluxe volume includes a running commentary by the photographer and remarks by the artist.  As a rule, Mr. Finn surveys the whole sculpture, approaching it from various angles; he then zeroes in on details. He insists that he is performing a service to the art, paying close attention to its settings, which usually are landscapes, and revealing aspects of it that otherwise might go unnoticed. And, in pictures such as those of the Glenkiln ''King and Queen,'' he does all of that.  Set on the moors of the Keswick estate in Dumfries, the bronze figures on a bench preside over bleak scenery with nothing to distract the eye save a leafless tree nearby.  A view of the bronze ''Warrior'' that sits outside the cathedral in Arnhem is also very effective, though less for the sculpture tucked in the lower right of the print than for the buttress behind it and the adjacent trees that loom so strangely out of a foggy atmosphere. It is no surprise to learn that scarcely anyone in this Dutch town is aware of the work's presence.  If many pictures show Mr. Finn discharging his self-imposed mission quite conscientiously, there are more that reveal him chafing a little under the burden. Views of forms joining, of the holes that are the trademark of both Mr. Moore and Barbara Hepworth and of the relationship between the art and surrounding foliage, these prints often threaten to turn their subjects into something else. There is, for instance, a detail of ''Large Arch,'' as it appears in the Indiana landscape that could be a part of Le Corbusier's church at Ronchamp; while shots of individual whorls and crevices in the curving piece owned by the State University College at Purchase begin to resemble a series of orifices seen by Georgia O'Keeffe.  Furthermore, Mr. Finn's emphasis on the art's surroundings can get him into esthetic trouble. The vista of a lake, yacht masts and a railing in Zollikon, Switzerland, doesn't exactly suit the bronze, ''Falling Warrior,'' displayed in front of it. In such a setting, the supine figure, one foot raised, resembles a tourist too charred to come in out of the sun. Unfortunate in another way is the rear view, again in color, of the Arnhem ''Warrior.'' The angle, coupled with unduly warm color, makes the torso seem like a living amputee proceeding across a de Chiricoesque stage set.  Color is not on the whole Mr. Finn's forte: The bronze female seated among narcissus in, apparently, an English town, appears quite black and reptilian against its background of washed-out blue sky and gray Jacobean buildings. The problem may come from a lack of technical know-how; but it has also to do with Mr. Finn's fundamental unease with nature. (Ever the humanist, the photographer speaks on one occasion of a tree relating to a sculpture, instead of the other way around.)  Photographing art is a very tricky business requiring, among other traits, a certain modesty. Despite his credentials as a collector of art and as a cultural hero worshiper, Mr. Finn is not a modest man, to judge from the zest with which he plays with Mr. Moore's forms in his detail studies. And, with all due respect to Lord Clark, he is far from being a ''photographer of genius.'' This is not to say that there aren't striking pictures here or that Mr. Finn's mission doesn't have fascinating psychological overtones. But his stance as the interpreter and enhancer of an oeuvre that needs neither service should be taken with a grain of salt. (Through Feb. 20.)

A Justice Department spokesman said in Washington that he doubted that deadline would be met. ''We've barely gotten into it,'' said the spokesman, Arthur P. Brill.  A new calendar that would postpone the primary for a couple of weeks is under consideration in Albany, Mr. Miller said. Even with Federal approval by the time of the court hearing, there could be a delay, to allow local election boards to adjust to the revised lines.  As with most matters in politically divided Albany, there are two approaches. While the Assembly, which is controlled by the Democrats, contemplates delaying the primary, the Republican-controlled Senate would simply shorten the political calendar. The Senate would postpone the date when candidates start circulating petitions - now June 22 - but would keep the primary date the same, according to James J. Lack, the Suffolk County Republican who heads the Senate Elections Committee.  ''There's a move afoot to delay the election calendar,'' he said. At present, he added, candidates could confront ''the specter of going out in the next couple of weeks with petitions for districts that aren't set.'' Five House Seats Lost  The new lines, drawn to reflect population shifts measured by the 1980 census, cut five seats from the state's Congressional delegation, reducing it to 34, and shift legislative power from New York City. The State Assembly would stay at 150 members, and the Senate would grow by one member to 61.  Federal approval is required under the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which applies to three of the state's 62 counties, the Bronx, Brooklyn and Manhattan, where voter registration is low.  While Federal lawyers study masses of maps and computer printouts from the state - the final State Senate lines, complicated by late adjustments in Queens, did not go to Washington until last Wednesday - a completely different set of lines is being prepared.  The second set, drawn under nonpolitical guidelines, is to be presented to a three-judge Federal court Monday by a special master, Robert P. Patterson Jr.  Mr. Patterson was appointed when the Legislature failed to act on reapportionment by a court-ordered deadline. Subsequently, the Legislature passed its own plan, but, by that time, Mr. Patterson had gone to work and the court continued in control. Legislators' Worry  What worries legislators is that their lines might still be in limbo, awaiting Federal approval, when the court holds its hearing on Mr. Patterson's version.  ''I haven't looked at the Legislature's maps,'' Mr. Patterson said the other day. The court instructed him to rule out political factors. This would wipe out districts like the one drawn by the Legislature for the Congressional seat now held by Representative Frederick W. Richmond of Brooklyn.  Albany's version of the district, designed to elect a Hispanic candidate, starts in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn, crosses the East River to Manhattan's Lower East Side and then vaults up to East Harlem.  Both plans - the Legislature's and Mr. Patterson's - must meet the one-man, one-vote guideline and, under the Voting Rights Act, must insure that there is no reduction in the number of districts in which racial minorities are in the majority. A key difference between the two sets of maps is that the Patterson plan does not require Justice Department clearance. Court's Options Considered  Legislators differ over the court's options. Can it, for instance, simply reject the Legislature's lines in favor of Mr. Patterson's? Not the way Assemblyman Miller sees it. ''If we've adopted a constitutional plan, we're it,'' he said. Senator Lack was not so sure. ''The court has continuing jurisdiction,'' he said. ''But I assume that Justice, signing off (on the Legislature's lines), would be a big plus.''  Whenever final lines are certified, election boards still must do considerable tinkering. In hundreds of cases, existing election districts have been split by new legislative or Congressional lines. Redrawing them is ''a horrendous job,'' said Betty Dolen, executive director of the New York City Board of Elections. The job is complicated, she noted, because Justice Department approval is required in the three boroughs covered by the Voting Rights Act. Summary: Possible delays in Justice Department approval of New York's new political boundaries could force postponement of the state's primary election, now scheduled for Sept. 14, according to key legislators.   The primary will likely be postponed, they say, unless the Government makes a decision by next Thursday, when a Federal court is to hold a hearing on a competing set of lines for Congressional and legislative districts.   ''It all depends on whether Justice can give us an answer by June 10,'' said Assemblyman H. Melvin Miller, the Brooklyn Democrat who heads the Assembly's Codes Committee.

For actress Deborra-Lee Furness, that means her handsome husband,  ,49, isn't  allowed  to star opposite  in Australia on Monday, Furness,59, joked she's made arrangements to make sure her husband,49, isn't cast alongside the sultry star.   I've told his agent he's not allowed to work with Angelina, I'm sure she's lovely,  Lee-Furness says, then adds,  I'm just kidding.   Lee-Furness says she's actually a huge fan of Jolie  2013 both on- and offscreen  2013 and mentioned the good work the 40-year-old actress has done for adoption and world aid. The couple were on the show to spread awareness for Adopt Change, an organization that aims to empower Australians to engage with issues affecting adoption.  Lee-Furness and Jackman, who met on the set of the Australian drama  , have been married for 19 years. She says it's important to choose wisely  2013 especially in show business, where you kiss your partner goodbye and he's off to kiss someone else for an acting part.   It just goes to show, if you get it right, if you pick the right partner, then you traverse all those travails and challenges.   The couple, who struggled to conceive a child naturally, have two adopted children, Oscar,14, and Ava, 9.  So, what's their secret to a long and happy union?  Deb had a rule, never apart for more than two weeks,  Jackman explained, saying that early in their relationship he learned it was best to say  yes  to her every whim.  Lee-Furness, for her part, says she likes having Jackman around.  He tells really good jokes, I mean I miss him,  she says, of his occasional absences.

The Fed based its rejection on what it deemed an inadequate plan from Citi to prepare for another recession.

Summary: MEXICO CITY (AP)  2014 Mexico mounted an all-out manhunt Sunday for its most powerful drug lord, Joaquin  El Chapo  Guzman, who authorities said escaped from a maximum security prison through a 1.5-kilometer (1 mile) tunnel from a small opening in the shower area of his cell.  The elaborate underground escape route, allegedly built without the detection of authorities, allowed Guzman to do what Mexican officials promised would never happen after his re-capture last year  2014 slip out of one of the country's most secure penitentiaries for the second time.  Guzman's escape is a major embarrassment to the Pena Nieto administration, which had received plaudits for its aggressive approach to top drug lords.  Since the government took office in late 2012, Mexican authorities have nabbed or killed six of them, including Guzman.  Guatemala's Interior Ministry said a special task force of police and soldiers were watching its border with southern Mexico for any sign of the fugitive drug lord.  Associated Press journalists near the Altiplano prison saw roads being heavily patrolled by federal police, with numerous checkpoints and a Black Hawk helicopter flying overhead.  The Mexican government at the time vehemently denied the need to extradite Guzman, even as many expressed fears he would escape as he did in 2001 while serving a 20-year sentence in the country's other top-security prison, Puente Grande, in the western state of Jalisco.  Rep. Filemon Vela, a Democrat from Texas, wrote that Mexico's failure to extradite Guzman and other figures facing charges in the United States  is an insult to the law enforcement and prosecutorial personnel who have worked for years to build criminal cases against these drug profiteers.

British filmmaker Stevan Riley has availed himself of hours of private audio recordings made by the late actor over the course of his life, and he has edited these together with films clips, news reports, archival footage, and the occasional random image. The result is something that feels fresh, even revelatory  2014 a work of elegiac bio-doc impressionism.  201cListen to Me Marlon 201d gets under the skin of the most mysterious performer of the 20th century and forces us to recalibrate all our feelings about him.  The movie 2019s signal image is its eeriest find: digitized footage of Brando 2019s head and face from a 1980s film test. This is Marlon as the ghost in the culture 2019s machine, a blue grid of Brando-esque pattern-dots that reappears throughout the documentary to quote Shakespeare and drop bitter musings in our ears.   201cI arrived in New York with holes in my socks and holes in my mind, 201d the actor says, and Riley folds in clips of Brando the young god, on the loose in New York. We glimpse acting teacher Stella Adler in old interviews and hear Brando recalling how she taught him to live and act without fear. Early memories of his youth in Omaha turn from innocence to darkness; of his adored mother, he says,  201cI used to love the smell of liquor on her breath. 201d  Fame comes with  201cA Streetcar Named Desire 201d on Broadway and then on screen,  201cand then your life changes. Girls saying  2018Hi, Mar. 2019  201d Not that he turned a single one of them down. But already the split was evident between who Brando was and who we wanted him to be  2014 an entirely new kind of actor, an entirely new kind of star. He was revolutionary in both areas, but you can feel the hostility when he says,  201cThere 2019s nothing about me like Stanley Kowalski.

He was scorned by so many people for getting fat, for losing his art, for not being sufficiently grateful for our attention, but with  201cListen to Me Marlon, 201d it 2019s as if Riley has ushered us into the darkened chamber of the actor 2019s memories, where Brando himself can whisper in our ear.  The movie convinces a viewer of the actor 2019s seriousness of intent in supporting the civil rights struggles of the 1960s and the Native American resistance movement of the 1970s. We all remember the farce of Sacheen Littlefeather lecturing the Oscar audience when Brando turned down his  201cGodfather 201d award, but Riley makes sure to add a subsequent Dick Cavett interview in which the star waxes brutally eloquent on America 2019s treatment of its native peoples.  Riley serves as his own editor, and he makes historical and emotional connections that Brando himself might argue with. Did Brando 2019s son Christian shoot and kill his sister 2019s abusive boyfriend out of the same protectiveness that prompted the young Marlon to shield his own mother from paternal beatings? That 2019s a tabloid reach, thankfully one of the movie 2019s few.

Pipelines tend to operate like a utility, changing a fee based on the volume of oil or gas that it transports. Thus, it has less of a direct connection to the actual price of oil.  With this in mind, Cramer presented a case study of two very different MLPs that reported recently and moved down together: Plains All American Pipeline, and Energy Transfer Partners. Plains All-American reported a bad quarter, and Energy Transfer reported a good one.  Yet, both stocks were crushed. What the heck?  In Cramer's opinion, it was the horrendous results from Plains All American that caused the entire MLP cohort to be slammed from its negative pin action.  Additionally, Cramer saw some enormous red flags from Plains All American. A large reason why investors own an MLP is because they assume that the cash distribution to shareholders will continue to increase. However management recently not only slashed its full year guidance, but it cut its distribution growth forecast down to 6 percent for 2015.  On the same day, Energy Transfer Partners and its general partner Energy Transfer Equity reported its results, which were pretty darned good in Cramer's opinion. And while the quarter seemed similar to that of Plains All American, when Cramer dug deeper he found that the results started to look different.

So when you buy Energy Transfer Partners for its 8.15 percent yield here, you can take some comfort in knowing that the distribution is not only safe, it's also still growing,  Cramer said.  At a time when the MLPs seem ripe for the rebound, Cramer warned investors to be careful. Only buy the strongest players in the space with the safest yields. That is why he is a buyer of Energy Transfer Partners and will stay far away from Plains All American.

It would be the nonunion teams vying against the union schools who could offer more to players, Lomax said.

The proposal, cited in an exchange filing, gave no details about the possible reform, but said the government would retain control of BoCom, China's fifth largest lender by assets.  HSBC is the largest foreign shareholder in BoCom, with a 19 percent stake, but the plan also did not mention anything about foreign ownership of Chinese banks.  When asked about the proposal, HSBC told Reuters it currently had no plans to change is shareholding in BoCom, which remains below the government's 20 percent cap.  BoCom is a long-term strategic partner,  said Vinh T Tran, HSBC senior media relations manager.  Although BoCom is publicly traded, state-owned institutions remain the largest shareholders. In its exchange filing late on Tuesday, the bank said it had won approval from the cabinet to explore allowing diversifying its shareholder structure to include more private ownership.  The proposed reform comes at a time when China's cooling economy has squeezed lending margins and sharply pushed up bad loans at the big five state-owned banks, adding urgency to the reform process.  BoCom was the first of these big lenders to start reforms under Beijing's two-year-long overhaul of its inefficient state-owned enterprises. Many of these companies have diversified ownership to include more non-state investors, seen as helping fight official corruption, as well as embarking on mergers and restructuring.  Ma Kunpeng, a Shanghai-based banking analyst at Sinolink Securities Co, said he expected Bank of China Ltd and China Construction Bank Corp to follow BoCom with their own reforms.   BoCom's reform is a start,  he added.  Last month, state-owned investment company Central Huijin Investment Ltd sold off some of its mainland-listed A shares of Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd and China Construction Bank Corp, which some analysts took as a signal that banks would soon start diversifying ownership.  The reforms in the banking sector also come after several global banks sold their holdings in Chinese lenders.  Spanish Bank BBVA this year said it had agreed to sell a 4.9 percent stake in China's CITIC Bank. In 2013, both Goldman Sachs and Bank of America sold stakes in top Chinese lenders.

The 9.2 percent sales tax that shoppers and diners pay in Glendale is among the highest in the state.  To fiscal conservatives, Glendale serves as a cautionary tale for suburban cities across the United States that want to throw public money at professional sports projects.   Overall, it's a bad move for cities,  said Kurt Altman, general counsel for the Arizona-based Goldwater Institute, which fought Glendale over its enticements to the hockey team.  As much as they say it's going to make the city a destination, it just doesn't.   Read MorePats used under-inflated footballs:NFL  Glendale is a city of about 250,000 people in the northwest part of the Phoenix metro area. The location where the Arizona Cardinals' stadium and the Arizona Coyotes' arena were built had been a dusty farm area. The agricultural influence is visible to people driving to games when they pass tractors and farm equipment in nearby fields.  As the Coyotes and Cardinals sought new facilities in the early 2000s and efforts failed to build them in other parts of the Phoenix area, Glendale stepped in. The city helped pay for the Coyotes' arena with $167 million in bonds in 2003, and as the hockey team's finances began to fade during the recession, Glendale went all-in to keep the team in Arizona. The city dished out $50 million earlier this decade to keep the team and continues to make annual payments toward the arena, but the money it is getting in return has not met expectations.  The football stadium was built in 2006, but Glendale was not on the hook for the costs of the $450 million retractable-roof facility. It was funded primarily with new taxes on car rentals and hotels in the Phoenix area, but that financing hit a snag last year when a judge ruled that the car rental tax was unconstitutional, leaving a major funding source for the Super Bowl venue in jeopardy. The issue is still being argued in the courts.  Glendale is far from alone. Cities and states nationwide have long struggled with how much public money to spend on stadium projects. The effort to build a new stadium for the Minnesota Vikings became embroiled in controversy over a financial commitment by the state that opponents said was excessive. The St. Louis Rams are at the center of a debate over whether to spend public money on a new stadium. Topeka, Kansas, is immersed in a fight over a motorsports track that has drawn comparisons to hockey in Glendale.  As he navigates the financial situation, Glendale Mayor Jerry Weiers returns to a maxim he has repeated many times in his life:  I'm not living in the past. I'm just paying for it.   In the case of the Super Bowl, he believes the city is paying dearly. He said Glendale will actually lose a  couple million dollars  by hosting the event. It's spending huge amounts of money on overtime and police and public safety costs associated with hosting the Super Bowl but getting very little in return.  Read MoreAnte up: This year's weirdest Super Bowl bets  Super Bowl visitors are mostly staying in Phoenix and Scottsdale and only showing up in Glendale on game day, meaning the city won't see much of a boost in tax revenue. And the city was hoping the state would reimburse Glendale for its police overtime costs, but lawmakers have scoffed at the idea.

During his lifetime, the cyclonic weather system of activity that was Schuller 2019s career  2014 as performer, composer, publisher, historian, conductor, administrator, record producer, and all-around musical standard-bearer  2014 did not ever seem to cease its whirl for long. His buoyancy and perennial optimism was of a kind that, despite the fact that he was 89 and fighting leukemia, his death in June still somehow came as a surprise. Schuller 2019s presence had a solidity as if its were its own local institution, right there alongside the city 2019s permanent orchestras and schools.  This month, as if to underline the point with a rare show of unity, a host of local academic institutions and performing-arts organizations are convening Gunther Schuller tributes. The commemorative programming will culminate on Nov. 22, when Schuller would have turned 90, with three different major events being presented by New England Conservatory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the Boston Modern Orchestra Project in partnership with Odyssey Opera.  On Sunday night in Pickman Hall, Collage New Music helped to launch this season of Schuller with a program that featured not only the composer 2019s virtuosic 1988  201cBouquet for Collage, 201d but also the premiere of his  201cSinging Poems, 201d written for Collage earlier this year.  Scored for soprano and mixed chamber ensemble, the new work features settings of texts by Shakespeare, Emily Dickinson, and Gertrude Stein, among others. In the details of its scoring and the vivid specificity of its imagination,  201cSinging Poems 201d is masterful if also somewhat elusive. The music is by turns edgy, jumpy, fractured, restless, and rugged. It eschews any semblance of a valedictory tone and avoids any overt gestures toward the conventional signs and semaphores of a  201clate style. 201d The text that receives the most potently expressive setting is perhaps Edna St. Vincent Millay 2019s  201cTime does not bring relief, 201d about the persistence of pain after the loss of a loved one. To anyone who heard Schuller speak in public about his late wife, Marjorie, the subtext seemed clear.  The Collage players, under David Hoose 2019s direction, gave the work a devoted and crystalline account, with soprano Mary Mackenzie deftly negotiating the intensely challenging vocal part and Collage founder Frank Epstein returning to the stage to realize (alongside Craig McNutt) the score 2019s complex and elaborate demands for percussion.  Sunday 2019s program also featured works by Paul Brust, Ricardo Zohn-Muldoon, and Rand Steiger. Sprinkled through the audience were many of Boston 2019s most celebrated composers. Their collective presence seemed a tribute all its own. Summary: On Sunday evening in Longy 2019s Pickman Hall, Collage New Music delivered the first of the month 2019s many tributes to the composer Gunther Schuller.",

Whitney Wolfe, former vice president of marketing for Tinder Inc., who described herself as a cofounder, said in a lawsuit filed June 30 that cofounder Justin Mateen verbally disparaged her and that company executives ignored her complaints and didn 2019t publicly recognize her as a cofounder because she 2019s a  2018 2018girl. 2019 2019  Tinder 2019s chief executive Sean Rad said in an internal memo to employees obtained by Bloomberg News and confirmed by the company that the allegations are  2018 2018full of factual inaccuracies and omissions. 2019 2019 Rad and the company, and parent IAC InterActiveCorp, which was also named in the lawsuit, haven 2019t yet responded in court.  The allegations raised in the complaint underscore the perception of the US technology industry as a male-dominated culture unfriendly to women, according to Scott Kessler, an analyst at S&P Capital IQ in New York.   2018 2018Although it is tempting to describe the conduct of Tinder 2019s senior executives as  2018frat-like, 2019 it was in fact much worse  2014 representing the worst of the misogynist, alpha-male stereotype too often associated with technology startups, 2019 2019 Wolfe said in her complaint against Tinder, filed in state court in Los Angeles.  Rad,28, said in his memo that the startup  2018 2018did not discriminate against Whitney because of her age or gender 2019 2019 and takes gender equality very seriously.  Rosette Pambakian, a spokeswoman for Los Angeles-based Tinder, declined to comment beyond Rad 2019s memo.  Tinder was hatched two years ago during a hack-a-thon at an incubator backed by billionaire Barry Diller 2019s IAC. Though Wolfe was with the company from the onset and had been recognized as a cofounder, Rad stripped her of the title when she was 24, according to her complaint.  Wolfe said in her lawsuit that she was subjected to sexist comments, e-mails, and text messages from chief marketing officer Mateen,28, and that her complaints were ignored by Rad. She said she was forced to resign and is seeking compensatory damages including back pay and equity.  Mateen was suspended upon the receipt of Wolfe 2019s allegations, pending an ongoing internal investigation, said Matthew Traub, a spokesman for IAC.   2018 2018Through that process, it has become clear that Mr. Mateen sent private messages to Ms. Wolfe containing inappropriate content, 2019 2019 Traub said in an e-mail.  2018 2018We unequivocally condemn these messages, but believe that Ms. Wolfe 2019s allegations with respect to Tinder and its management are unfounded. 2019 2019  Mateen didn 2019t respond to an e-mail sent to his work address seeking comment on Wolfe 2019s lawsuit.  The allegations could have an impact on IAC 2019s plans for Tinder, according to Kessler.  Tinder is part of IAC 2019s Match Group, a business segment that was separated into its own unit in December, potentially setting the stage for a spinoff of the dating services.   2018 2018Given what 2019s going on at Tinder, I would assume that probably would cause IAC and Match to think a little bit longer and harder about pursuing that at this juncture, 2019 2019 Kessler said.  Even as the technology industry 2019s glass ceiling is being shattered by high-profile executives like Facebook Inc. 2019s Sheryl Sandberg and Yahoo Inc. 2019s Marissa Mayer, complaints about gender equality persist.  Technology companies Google Inc. and Facebook have recently acknowledged that women make up 30 percent and 31 percent of their workforces, respectively, ramping up pressure on Silicon Valley to hire more women and minorities.  Facebook and Twitter Inc. were criticized leading up to their initial public offerings for not having any female directors, and 74 percent of US workers in computer and mathematical occupations last year were men, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Snapchat Inc. chief executive Evan Spiegel apologized in May for profanity-laced e-mails he sent during his fraternity days at Stanford University that celebrated getting drunk and convincing sorority women to perform sexual acts.  In March 2013, Adria Richards received threats of violence and was fired from her software job at startup SendGrid Inc. after she posted an image online of male programmers she accused of making inappropriate innuendos at a programming event in Santa Clara, Calif.  Ellen Pao, a former partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, sued the venture capital firm in 2012 alleging it treated female employees unfairly by promoting and compensating them less than men. She said she faced retaliation after she complained about sexual harassment. Kleiner, which tried unsuccessfully to move Pao 2019s claims to arbitration, has denied the allegations.

            "input": "text:Cheniere's push right now on Wall Street is notable because it comes at a time when the energy markets are being buffeted by unusual volatility.  Read MoreWill oil's drop hurt renewable energy?  Since Thanksgiving, crude oil has been trading at multiyear lows, leaving the European benchmark, Brent crude, down some 40 percent on the year in the U.S. That move has raised questions about whether drillers, where prices have also plummeted, will be able to keep operating profitably and continue to repay their debts. Already, major players like ConocoPhillips are trimming their capital spending in anticipation of slimming profit margins.  Liquefied natural gas, the commodity Cheniere 2014whose stock ticker is LNG as well 2014is planning to produce, trades on a market separate from oil. But as a commodity, LNG's price can be greatly affected by the price of crude, which is frequently used as a peg for setting overseas prices.  LNG prices have tumbled this year, according to figures from the market-data provider Platts, sinking more than 43 percent in Japan and Korea, a key Asian market, and by more than 40 percent in other global markets.  Today's volatility is  happening at a time where gas prices were already much lower than the same period of last year,  said Leslie Palti-Guzman, a senior energy analyst at the Eurasia Group,  so when you add to that glut lower oil prices, it means global gas prices are going to decline even further.   Read MoreOil's market impact: Barrel half empty, half full  She added that she  absolutely  expects LNG prices to fall in 2015, both in the  spot,  or day-to-day, market, and in the longer-term contract market.  Cheniere, a Houston-based company that in 2012 became the first ever to receive Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) permission to export LNG from the lower 48 states, has been in the market to raise billions for the development of its Corpus Christi project since at least November, according to deal documents.  By late that month, the company had secured initial commitments from more than 16 major banks to provide up to $1 billion apiece for the planned seven-year credit facility, the documents indicated (although the actual amounts, they noted, might fall closer to the $625 million mark once the deal is consummated). The list of lenders includes Societe Generale, which is leading the financing effort, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley, HSBC, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, and Mizuho, along with more than a dozen others.  Read MoreThe countries slammed worst by plunging oil prices  Reached for comment on the expected deal, which people close to it say is hoped to close early in the new year, a Cheniere spokeswoman said,  There isn't any new information to be shared at this time.  The financing plans were first reported Nov. 21 by the trade publication Power Finance & Risk.  LNG price estimates compiled by FERC pegged U.S. Gulf Coast prices at $3.72 for December, a level not far off from those of conventional natural gas, which closed on the benchmark Henry Hub market at $3.61 late Monday. Overseas, however, LNG trades at much higher prices, according to FERC charts, particularly in Asia, where it is estimated to be trading at $12 in the spot markets in Korea and Japan. The price tends to be even higher in longer-term contract markets, where companies like Cheniere do business.  But while many LNG contracts are determined in large part by Brent or other global crude markets, Cheniere has the advantage of using the Henry Hub natural-gas price as the basis of its 20-year supply contracts, according to company documents, leaving it less vulnerable to the vicissitudes of the oil market.  Read MoreVenezuela is in a bind for cash  Even if LNG markets don't fall by much, another potential hitch in the Corpus Christi deal would be a downturn in the high-yield debt market, which Cheniere is expecting to tap in order to help repay the banks in its planned $11.5 billion Corpus Christie LNG terminal. In 2015, for instance, Cheniere is expected to issue some $4 billion in bonds, deal documents suggest. In 2016, that figure would climb to $7.5 billion.  Cheniere backers argue that the company, whose shares have enjoyed a massive, 600 percent runup in the past three years, is well-positioned to weather additional volatility in the energy markets.  Bonds associated with its Sabine Pass terminal, a project similar to the Corpus Christi facility that is expected to come online next year, are trading at par, one market participant noted, whereas many other comparable energy bonds are trading below par.

            "input": "text:If the specter of a default has spooked corporate America, you wouldn 2019t know it by watching their hired guns in Washington over the last several weeks.  Aside from sending a handful of letters urging Congress to act, the big business lobby has mostly hugged the sidelines as the partisan standoff over the debt limit crisis intensified. That appears poised to change, now that there are only five days to go until the Treasury Department says it will run out of money to pay all the federal government 2019s bills.  With Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) set to put his plan for a debt ceiling hike to a vote in the House today, the heaviest-hitting trade associations are finally piping up and urging their member companies to rally behind the proposal. On Wednesday evening, a broad collective of those groups  2014 including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Business Roundtable, and the National Association of Home Builders  2014 cosigned a letter to Members of Congress endorsing the plan. And officials with those groups said this time, they will be following up with an aggressive, coordinated lobbying effort to try to muscle the package through a jumpy House Republican conference.  But considering the stakes  2014 business types in Washington agree a default would be calamitous  2014 the failure of the business lobby to engage more forcefully earlier has even some veteran K Street hands scratching their heads.  201cIf you look at the totality of the communications and the lobbying efforts, this has been uncharacteristically quiet, 201d says one.  201cIt 2019s been a minimalist approach, and I 2019d have expected the business community to be much more vocal. 201d  Representatives of the groups are quick to dispel that point. The Chamber, for example, has spent months organizing lobbying visits to skeptical lawmakers to explain the gravity of the threat. And NAM has been  201ctalking about this issue for almost a year, 201d says Dorothy Coleman, the group 2019s vice president of tax and domestic economic policy. But the commitment barely registers against the eight-figure sums the groups regularly dole out for more parochial causes.  There have been at least a few factors at work keeping big business groups from mounting a concerted campaign to sound the alarm.  For the most part, they 2019ve rested on the assumption that Congress would figure out on its own how to extend the federal government 2019s borrowing authority without seriously flirting with default. Ken Bentsen, a former Democratic Congressman from Texas now lobbying for the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, said his group only started asking member companies to focus on the issue last week.  201cIt 2019s unthinkable you 2019d really default, and our members are just coming to grips with the fact that if we don 2019t act, this could really happen, 201d he says.  There was a similar dynamic three years ago, when the stunning failure in the House of the first attempt to pass the Wall Street bailout sent a relatively complacent business lobby into what one banking lobbyist called a  201cno-huddle hyper-drive blitzkrieg. 201d   201cWe all expected that to pass, too, and when it didn 2019t, we lit it up, 201d this lobbyist said. The Chamber, NAM, the Financial Services Roundtable, and the BRT, which represents top CEOs, all got in on the act, launching a cooperative push with the Bush administration and Congressional leaders to round up votes, in part by generating constituent pressure on wobbly lawmakers.  201cThe effort was extraordinary, 201d says Joanna Schneider, of the BRT.  201cWe talked to Secretary Paulson every day, we had CEO conference calls with the Secretary every day, and we made a massive effort for all the CEOs, particularly where they had large employment centers, to make calls. 201d  Lobbyists for the major trade groups point to other reasons they 2019ve taken a largely hands-off approach so far. Several noted that until this week, there was no specific, credible proposal for them to help push. Presumably, the lack of legislative text wouldn 2019t prevent the groups from bankrolling, say, a major advertising campaign to educate voters about the stakes. Those types of campaigns are hardly uncommon.  But the argument points to what has been perhaps the most powerful motivator in keeping big business mum: fear of what could end up in whatever package makes it into law. As long as tax hikes remained on the table as a means of trimming the deficit, industries that could see their bottom lines bitten wanted to reserve the right to object.  Indeed, it 2019s not that there 2019s been no active lobbying on the debt ceiling by corporate interests. From April through June, more than 140 outfits reported lobbying work on the issue, according to a review of disclosure reports by the Sunlight Foundation. The vast majority appears to have engaged to protect narrow tax privileges, or even seek new breaks. Blue Cross Blue Shield, Oracle ORCL , Exxon Mobil XOM , Pfizer PFE , Devon Energy DVN , Northrop Grumman NOC , and Wal-Mart WMT all reported at least monitoring the talks. Some no doubt felt more threatened than others. With President Obama making a refrain of the charge that Republicans want to protect a tax break for corporate jet owners at the expense of seniors and middle-income earners, the National Business Aviation Association launched an effort to defend the provision as a job-creator.   201cThey 2019re all for shared sacrifice as long as they 2019re not the ones sharing, 201d says Bill Allison of the Sunlight Foundation.  Or, as one Republican lobbyist describes the investment by K Street 2019s power-players:  201cThey couldn 2019t have done less if they tried, spent zero dollars and no cents. And it 2019s because they 2019re gutless. They 2019ve not done anything because they don 2019t want to pop their heads above ground and get their heads taken off. 201d  With any direct changes to entitlement programs and the tax code likely to be left out of the package, the coast is now clear for the big business groups to jump in. And there 2019s nothing like an impending economic Armageddon to marshal their focus. But when this scare subsides, and the big business lobbies go back to pressing for specialized treatment under the guise it serves a greater economic good, it will be worth remembering where these special interests stood when that cause was imperiled. Summary: The business lobby has entered the debt ceiling debate at the 11th hour with only a whimper, considering the stakes of a default for corporations.",

Marlon Samuels top scored with 85 off 66 as the West Indies posted 6-161 in reply to England's 9-155 at Eden Gardens on Sunday - but it was Brathwaite's extraordinary final over heroics which carried them across the line.  With the Windies needing 19 from the final six balls, Brathwaite (34 off 10) blasted four consecutive sixes off England's Ben Stokes to seal a remarkable comeback.  Samuels was awarded man of the match and cheekily dedicated the Windies' historic second World Twenty20 title to Australian spin legend Shane Warne, who has clashed him on a number of occasions.  West Indies Carlos Brathwaite, right, celebrates with teammate Marlon Samuels. (AAP)  They had an infamous run-in during Australia's Big Bash League in 2013, and Warne rekindled the feud when he criticised Samuels following his dismissal against India in Thursday's WT20 semi-final.   I woke up this morning with one thing on my mind,  Samuels said.   Shane Warne has been talking continuously and all I want to say is this is for Shane Warne.   Samuels made just eight in the Windies' seven-wicket victory over India in the last-four, but his monumental innings on Sunday was reminiscent of his contribution in the final four years ago.  The West Indies won their first World T20 title in 2012, when Samuels scored 78 against Sri Lanka in the final.   I don't worry about semi-finals because when it comes to finals I always turn up for the team,  he said.  Meanwhile, Carlos Brathwaite played down his historic six-hitting blitz which led the Windies to the World Twenty20 title on Sunday, preferring to pay tribute to man-of-the-match Marlon Samuels. Brathwaite, a 27-year-old Barbadian all-rounder, made light of the Windies needing 19 off the final over to smash Ben Stokes for four successive sixes. The four-wicket win gave the Caribbean side a second World Twenty20 title but as headline star Chris Gayle flopped, Brathwaite emerged from the shadows to finish on an undefeated 34 off 10 balls. He had earlier taken 3-23 as England made 155-9. With bat and ball, they were his career best figures in the game's shortest form in just his eighth game.  Today Marlon Samuels took responsibility right away and played a fantastic knock,  he said.  He did it in 2012 and I knew as long as he was there at the end he would bring us home again in 2016.  Captain Darren Sammy saluted his unlikely hero who came in with his team on 107-6 in the 16th over.  In every game, somebody stepped up and took responsibility and to see Carlos play like that in his debut World, it's just tremendous,  he said. Brathwaite has yet to truly establish himself as an international star. He made his Test debut against Australia last year and has played just two matches, taking one wicket and making 130 runs -- 59 on debut in Melbourne and then a 69 in Sydney. He has played seven one-day internationals since 2011, making only 71 runs and claiming three wickets.  Brathwaite will play next month for the Delhi Daredevils in the money-spinning Indian Premier League.

            "input": "text:Even for the de facto head of one of the world 2019s largest family-controlled business empires, Jay Y. Lee, vice chairman of Samsung Electronics SSNLF , has had a lot on his plate lately. On the same Thursday morning in early June that he breakfasted in Seoul with J.P. Morgan JPM CEO Jamie Dimon, for instance, Lee learned that the $26 billion New York hedge fund Elliott Management had launched a surprise attack against him. Elliott wanted to stop Lee from merging two publicly traded pieces of his family 2019s network of companies, potentially foiling Lee 2019s plan to consolidate control.  A few weeks later, on the day he turned 47, Lee gave his first-ever nationally televised speech in South Korea to offer an apology 2014including a symbolic bow 2014because the Samsung Medical Center in Seoul had failed to contain an outbreak of the deadly Middle East respiratory syndrome virus known as MERS. Not long after, the scion of the family that runs Korea 2019s mightiest conglomerate led a team of executives on a fact-finding mission to Silicon Valley. An avid golfer, Lee found time to pop down to Pebble Beach for a members-and-guests-only tournament at the exclusive Cypress Point Golf Course with his pal and host Jerry Yang, the Yahoo YHOO co-founder. Days later, after returning to Korea, he jetted back to the U.S. to hobnob with other global tech leaders at the annual Allen & Co. gathering in Sun Valley, Idaho. In mid-July, Lee found out that he had prevailed in his heated six-week battle with Elliott, and that shareholders had voted to approve the merger.  A veritable prince of the realm in Korea and supremely well connected among the global elite, Lee, who has a net worth of around $8 billion, nevertheless is not widely known outside his native land. At home, Lee 2019s life as a single dad and the next-generation leader of Samsung makes him a boldface name. Even in Korea, however, it isn 2019t well understood exactly what he does. That 2019s partly because he has long been overshadowed by his larger-than-life father, Lee Kun-hee, chairman of the Samsung Group.  The younger Lee 2019s profile is about to grow dramatically. In recent months he has made himself more visible, implicitly acknowledging that he is now the leader of the Lee clan and its business interests. The elder Lee, age 73 and Samsung 2019s chief for nearly 30 years, suffered a heart attack 14 months ago. He has been hospitalized ever since 2014at the same Samsung-owned facility where the MERS crisis began 2014and his condition is believed to be so grave that he cannot communicate and isn 2019t expected to recover. In other words, the man who built Samsung into a global powerhouse in everything from semiconductors to TVs to mobile phones has all but left the scene. And he has been succeeded 2014in actions, if not yet in title 2014by his relatively untested only son.  Jay Y. Lee, Samsung 2019s debonair, globe-trotting heir apparent, is determined to transform the world 2019s biggest technology company into its most innovative. Can he dethrone Apple?Photo illustration by Anthony Verducci. Based on photo by Lee Young Ho SIPA 2014AP  So just who is Lee Jae-yong, known to his Western friends as Jay Y. Lee? Simply speaking, he is everything Samsung wants to be 2014but isn 2019t yet. One of three vice chairmen of Samsung Electronics, the conglomerate 2019s largest company, Lee runs no single business yet holds great sway over all of them. (He has two younger sisters who run businesses within the group; a third sister committed suicide in 2005.) He is the most international Samsung executive 2014he speaks fluent Japanese and English, and travels widely 2014yet is thoroughly a product of his Korean heritage. Just as Lee glides between Asian and Western worlds, his goal is to move Samsung beyond its Korean roots without losing the attributes that led to its success.  The generational transition comes at a critical time for Samsung. Its cash-gushing smartphone business is tops in the world by market share but has recently found itself squeezed by the vastly more profitable Apple on the high end and a bevy of price-slashing Chinese competitors below. As well, membership in the privileged club of Korean conglomerates, known (in both singular and plural) as chaebol, isn 2019t quite what it used to be, what with a new era of shareholder activism and public revulsion at the behavior of elites.  Lee doesn 2019t grant on-the-record interviews to the media, and he and Samsung 2019s top executives are exceedingly sensitive about upstaging the ailing patriarch, in keeping with the Confucian tradition of respect for elders. At the same time, Samsung is a notably image-conscious company, and it is well aware of the intensifying scrutiny of its all-but-anointed leader. With that in mind, Samsung recently gave Fortune unusually deep access to various corners of its domain. The company also made available the CEOs of two key companies in the Samsung Group. Both executives spoke openly about Jay Y. Lee 2019s leadership and the challenges he faces.  Among Lee 2019s priorities, these executives and others say, are to simplify a dizzyingly complex corporate structure, to prod Samsung 2019s leadership to be creative as well as relentless, and to globalize what has stubbornly remained an essentially Korean company that just happens to sell products around the world. Lee and his coterie of powerful executives know there will be plenty of resistance to these changes. After all, Samsung has successfully employed its traditional  201cme-too 201d approach for decades 2014jumping into new lines of business and out-executing the competition until it becomes the market leader. In the process Samsung has grown into one of the world 2019s biggest and richest corporate kingdoms. With $195.8 billion in revenue last year, Samsung Electronics ranks No. 13 on this year 2019s Global 500 2014the largest tech company on the list and two spots ahead of Apple AAPL . Construction and trading business Samsung C&T (No. 441) and Samsung Life Insurance (No. 456) are also ranked in the Global 500. Together, the Samsung Group has more than $320 billion in sales from dozens of separate companies.  But the fear inside Samsung 2019s executive suite is that its success, especially in the realm of technology, could be fleeting. Leadership in tech markets tends not to last, as Samsung 2019s recent dip in smartphones shows. A sense of healthy paranoia pervades Samsung that an insular mentality and a reliance on commodity products won 2019t serve it as well in the future as they have in the past. Samsung executives frequently reference the downfall of once-powerful Japanese electronics rivals such as Sony and Sharp.  Curved, ultra-high definition Samsung TV 2019s on display in New York City in April 2015. Samsung is the No. 1 manufacturer of TV 2019s globally, ahead of Korean rival LG.Photograph by Diane Bondareff 2014AP  To avoid such a fate, Samsung today is hyperfocused on innovation 2014with an emphasis on game-changing advances. The company has long pushed the envelope in everything from semiconductors to smartphones to televisions. For example, its smartphone chips are considered superior to Intel 2019s INTC . What it has not achieved is the creation of new industries,  00e0 la Apple. To increase the chances of a major breakthrough, Samsung Electronics spent nearly $14 billion on research and development last year 2014or easily more than twice the $6 billion that Apple devoted to R&D in 2014.  Money alone won 2019t achieve what Lee wants, however. To keep Samsung growing and to challenge Apple in the eyes of customers, Lee and his key advisers believe, the company must be willing to embrace both new ideas and new leaders from outside Korea.  201cThe biggest challenge that we have is that there are a lot of people still, the old-timers of Samsung, who don 2019t really understand what  2018global 2019 means, 201d says Choi Chi-hun, CEO of Samsung C&T.  201cJay is a very global person. He understands this. 201d Understanding is one thing, of course. Changing an organization with nearly half-a-million employees is another thing altogether.  At the beginning of 2015 a group of senior executives in Samsung Electronics 2019 TV manufacturing division, which is No. 1 in market share with more than 20% of global sales, held a meeting attended by Jay Y. Lee. The vice chairman, as he is typically referred to by Samsung 2019s more formal officials, made some mildly critical comments about the division 2019s marketing efforts, according to a version of the meeting that has made the rounds of Samsung 2019s top managers. Thirty-year veteran Park Gwang-gi, an executive vice president and the unit 2019s head of strategic marketing, was said to be so rattled by Lee 2019s criticism that he immediately resigned his position.  The anecdote is notable because it helps illustrate the power that Samsung 2019s founding family wields despite the complicated chain of ownership and command inside the conglomerate. For starters, operating authority resides in individual business units, not headquarters. What 2019s more, the Lee family holds a relatively small stake in Samsung Electronics and even smaller positions in other Samsung affiliates. Further confusing things, it can be a challenge to define just what Samsung is 2014or isn 2019t. Consider a disclaimer Samsung posts on a corporate website:  201cEach company within the Samsung Group is an independent legal entity. Samsung Group is not a legal entity. Samsung Group is a term to conveniently refer to a group of companies that are tied together by their corporate history. 201d  That corporate history dates back some eight decades, to when Jay Y. Lee 2019s grandfather, Lee Byung-chul, started a food trading business in 1938. Today the chaebol comprises 67 distinct businesses whose product lines range from apparel and amusement parks to shipbuilding, washing machines, and financial services. Because of its market-leading positions in three massive industries 2014smartphones, memory chips, and TVs 2014Samsung Electronics is by far the most important part of the conglomerate, accounting for two-thirds of group revenues and an even greater portion of its profits.  Samsung owes its rise from middling chaebol to global powerhouse to the achievements of the current chairman Lee. He urged his executives to invest aggressively in order to gain scale and market share 2014regardless of short-term profits.  201cOur chairman consistently made the decision to invest regardless of the business environment, 201d says Kwon Oh-hyun, a Samsung Electronics vice chairman and head of its semiconductor business. Kwon, who earned a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Stanford before joining Samsung in 1985, says there was a widespread belief back then that the elder Lee  201cwas crazy and would bankrupt the company 201d with his investment in memory chips.  201cBut he succeeded and became legendary. 201d  The company followed the same invest-for-scale model in each of its major businesses, displacing Sony in TVs and Nokia in mobile phones. Along the way it developed a reputation for brute-force tactics against competitors and a win-at-all-costs ethos among its overworked employees. Today Samsung Electronics is a behemoth with 307,000 workers. It 2019s so big, in fact, that it builds whole mini-metropolises to accommodate the growth. Its Samsung Digital City in Suwon, outside Seoul, has the look and feel of a Silicon Valley corporate campus, with 500 different bus routes ferrying its 34,000 employees to and from Seoul and other parts of South Korea.  This hyperplanned environment is in keeping with Samsung 2019s penchant for controlling every step of its production. Building its own factories gives the company a speed advantage, says Choi, the Samsung C&T executive. Samsung originally intended to release its Galaxy S6 line of smartphones in the fall of this year, says Choi, but decided to move up production by six months.  201cWe were building that plant for them, 201d he says of his construction business in an interview at Samsung 2019s main headquarters in the posh Gangnam district in central Seoul.  201cWorking together we were able to come up with a way of getting those phones to be produced that I don 2019t think anyone else could have done. 201d  The best and worst of the Samsung fast-follower model can be seen in both the soaring success and relative decline of late in its biggest business: smartphones. Samsung Electronics plunged full force into the market after the debut of the iPhone in 2007. And after a decision in 2009 to use Google 2019s low-cost Android operating system across its product line 2014as a way of quickly and cheaply countering Apple 2019s proprietary operating system, iOS 2014Samsung raced to the top of the heap in 2011 with its Galaxy S II phone. Its profits then skyrocketed, especially when its large-size screens proved popular and Apple was slow to respond. Then last year Apple rolled out its larger-screen iPhone 6 devices, and Samsung 2019s growth hit a wall. Samsung Electronics recently previewed second-quarter financial results, suggesting that profits will be $6.1 billion, down 4% from the year-earlier period and the seventh consecutive quarterly profit decline. All things 2014including screen size 2014being equal, consumers appear willing to pay a premium for the innovation coming out of Apple.  The view inside Samsung is that the margins and growth in smartphones during 2012 and 2013 were abnormal, and that even the current depressed level of profitability is an achievement. Shaun Cochran, Korea country head of brokerage CLSA, finds merit in the argument.  201cThere are two companies in the world that have a profitable position in smartphones, and they 2019re one of them, 201d he says.  201cThe margins are no longer supermargins. But really, supermargins are temporary by nature. Only Apple gets them now. 201d  People familiar with Jay Y. Lee 2019s thinking about the slowdown describe him as disappointed but not ready to back down. He acknowledges that Samsung isn 2019t No. 1 in smartphones yet.  201cIt is Apple by revenue, profit, and mindshare of customers, 201d one of them related Lee as having said.  201cThat said, we 2019ve been benchmarking Sony, Philips, and Nokia for years. Now we have fewer companies to benchmark. 201d  Yang Yuanqing, the CEO of Lenovo LNVGY , first met Jay Y. Lee at the Summer Olympics in Beijing in 2008. Samsung and Lenovo both were sponsors of the games, and, says Yang,  201cOur private booths were next to each other. 201d Despite being a competitor across multiple product lines, Lenovo is one of Samsung 2019s biggest customers, annually buying more than $2 billion worth of various kinds of semiconductors and LCDs for its computers. The two struck up a friendship. Yang praises Lee for his attention to detail and was particularly touched by a gift the Samsung leader brought on a visit to Beijing:  201cHe found out my birth year and gave me a bottle of wine that was produced that year. 201d  The gesture is vintage Lee, who is known for his impeccable manners and cosmopolitan demeanor. Indeed, Lee in many ways was raised for the role of global ambassador for Samsung. He studied history at Seoul National University, Korea 2019s top school. Like his father and grandfather before him, he studied in Japan, earning an MBA from Keio University. He later completed doctoral coursework at Harvard Business School, though he left without a degree. After presiding over a failed business unit called e-Samsung during the Internet bubble of the early 2000s, Lee took on the role he 2019d been born for: learning beside his father for the day he 2019d take his place.  Part of that role has been representing Samsung with its most important customers 2014some of whom, like Lenovo, are equally bitter competitors. Lee, for example, is said to have personally negotiated with Steve Jobs over Apple 2019s critical purchase of flash memory for the iPod Nano. The deal was a watershed because it required a significant commitment of manufacturing capacity by Samsung for an Apple product that wasn 2019t yet proven in the marketplace.  To this day Lee is a linchpin of the complicated Apple-Samsung relationship, and he keeps in touch with CEO Tim Cook as well as Jeff Williams, Cook 2019s successor as head of Apple 2019s global procurement and supply-chain management.  201cI 2019ve heard them talk about Jay fondly, 201d says a U.S.-based executive who has interacted with both sides. Says Lee Keon-hyok, a former IMF economist who is Lee 2019s chief spokesman:  201cI compare it to Romeo and Juliet. The families go on feuding, but they agree to the marriage. 201d (Fond of Lee or not, neither Cook nor Williams agreed to be interviewed about him; in 2012, Apple, which still buys Samsung chips and displays, won a $1 billion patent-infringement judgment against Samsung in a U.S. court over disputed smartphone designs.)

Samsung hopes the new smartphone, which went on sale in April, will win back straying customers.Photograph by Kim Hong-Ji 2014Reuters  Samsung 2019s might and Lee 2019s charm have cemented other important tie-ups for Samsung. John Elkann, the Agnelli family scion who is Lee 2019s equivalent in the Fiat empire, invited Lee to join the board of Exor, the publicly traded company that manages the Agnelli family 2019s stakes. He praises Lee for having advised Exor on its ongoing efforts to simplify its corporate structure and enter the insurance business.  A common refrain about Lee is how relatively normal he is.  201cHe 2019s surprisingly casual and accessible and a nice guy and non-hierarchical, given who he is, 201d says a former Samsung executive who interacted with Lee occasionally.  201cHe travels by himself, with no entourage. He dresses casually. He says,  2018Hi, I 2019m Jay, nice to meet you. 2019  201d Lee has instructed the guards at Samsung 2019s headquarters not to bow 90 degrees to him. He displays his own ID when he walks around the building. And he delights in taking visiting dignitaries to see the on-site day-care center his father built to help retain women at Samsung.  Lee may also be the most eligible bachelor in Korea. A father of a school-age son and daughter, he was divorced from their mother in 2009. He lives in what visitors describe as a relatively modest home built on land his family has owned for decades in an upscale Seoul neighborhood. His dining room is steps from the exquisite Leeum art museum 2014the name is a mashup of  201cLee 201d and  201cmuseum 201d 2014which holds a priceless collection, begun by his grandfather, of ancient Korean and contemporary international art. Lee is said to be particularly proud of the solar panels he had installed on the roof of his home.  The son apparently intends to be a more visible chairman of Samsung than his father, who visited the head office infrequently, preferring to work from home and maintain an air of mystery. To the extent that the younger Lee already has made his mark, it is with an ongoing effort to streamline Samsung. In recent years Samsung has sold off businesses with interests in disk drives, defense, and petrochemicals.  Outside executives see savvy analysis behind that strategy. Steve Luczo, CEO of disk-drive maker Seagate, praises Lee for the insight and decisiveness that led Seagate to buy out Samsung 2019s drive business in 2011. The moment competitors Western Digital and Hitachi agreed to combine their businesses, says Luczo, Lee recognized that Samsung 2019s operation would be better off in the hands of Seagate, which had significantly larger market scale.  201cHe started asking all the right questions, 201d says Luczo.  201cAnd they were detailed operating questions. 201d  Doubts linger about Lee closer to home, however, partly because of his privileged background.  201cChairman Lee gathered a couple thousand people and said,  2018I 2019ll give you any resource. I want 50% share of mobile handsets, 2019  201d recounts a Korean executive who knows the Lee family well.  201cI 2019m not sure Jay has that. He was raised to be a king, not an entrepreneur. 201d  But according to those who know him, Lee doesn 2019t intend to become a headliner on behalf of Samsung 2019s companies, even when he assumes the chairman 2019s role. His father allowed operating executives to be the faces of their businesses, and so will he. Still, Lee has told people he understands the downside of being an enigma. He has said he understands the need to demystify the role of the founding family.  Far from Samsung 2019s headquarters, on the other side of Seoul, lies a newly developed section of town called Digital Media City that has become a hub for young television and gaming companies. (Not to be confused with Samsung Digital City; Korea is extremely  201cdigital. 201d) On the set of a studio there on a sunny June afternoon, the boy band EXO is rehearsing a performance of its hit single  201cLove Me Right. 201d Two hundred adolescent girls wait impatiently to enter the studio to see their teenage idols. The band 2019s host is the entertainment division of film production and consumer-goods conglomerate CJ Group, sponsor of a popular TV show that will feature EXO later that day.  CJ has little in common with Samsung, which is as buttoned-up a company as they come, but for one fact: The entertainment group is run by a cousin of Jay Y. Lee 2019s named Miky Lee. She is known for having made an early and lucrative investment in DreamWorks Animation. The  201cC 201d in CJ stands for Cheil, the original name of the Lee family holding company that exists to this day as Cheil Industries.  As the No. 1 operator of Korean movie theaters and also the franchisee for multiple retail outlets, foreign and domestic, CJ is just one example of the vast reach of the family behind Samsung. One of Jay Y. Lee 2019s sisters, Lee Boo-jin, runs Hotel Shilla, a high-end hotel company that has expanded into the duty-free business. His other sister, Lee Seo-hyun, heads up the fashion business of Cheil Industries. Cheil Worldwide is the largest advertising agency in Korea. Relatives of Lee 2019s run the Shinsegae department store and the leading daily newspaper, JoongAng Ilbo, which was started by the patriarch in the 1960s and is considered friendly to Samsung, though it 2019s not owned by it.  Chairman Lee Kun-hee built Samsung into South Korea 2019s most important chaebol but is believed to be gravely ill. Daughters Boo-jin (right) and Lee Seo-hyun each run parts of the family business empire.Photograph by Steve Marcus 2014Reuters  In short, the Lee family touches almost every aspect of Korean life. Young people simultaneously blame Samsung (and other chaebol like Hyundai and LG) for sucking the air out of what other-wise could be an entrepreneurial climate and want to work for it. The 18 listed companies in the Samsung network are widely perceived to trade at a discount to their true market value based on the perception that the family runs the companies for its own goals rather than for shareholders.  This is precisely what attracted the attention of Elliott Management, which amassed a 7% stake in Samsung C&T, when it unveiled plans to be bought by Cheil Industries, which is 23% owned by Jay Y. Lee. Elliott argued that Samsung C&T was undervalued and that Cheil was unfairly acquiring it for its 4% stake in Samsung Electronics. The Lee family previously held a less than 5% stake in the electronics company, and the merger, Elliott contended, would give Jay Y. Lee and his two sisters a windfall gain they will need to pay the inheritance tax they will owe when their father dies.  If the assault by Elliott caught Samsung by surprise, it was prepared for the fight nevertheless. Samsung carried the day in Korean courts against two injunctions brought by Elliott. And shareholders in Samsung C&T, led by a large block of Korean pension funds, approved the merger in a much-watched shareholder vote on July 17. It was the first time the Samsung empire had encountered such an attack by foreign investors, but likely will not be the last.  In the western city of Inchon, the port town on the Yellow Sea where Douglas MacArthur landed and turned the tide of the Korean War, lies a glimpse into Samsung 2019s future. Here, in just four years, the conglomerate has built a vast new business called Samsung Biologics, which manufactures biopharmaceuticals for global drug companies, including Roche Genentech and Bristol-Myers Squibb. The business is said to be a favorite project of Lee 2019s, and it has all the hallmarks of a Samsung endeavor: massive scale, billions in investments, and the application of manufacturing expertise to a promising new business.  On the surface, at least, it appears to be another example of fast-following. Samsung Biologics makes tough-to-produce drugs for the owners of the formula the same way Foxconn builds phones and computers for name-brand designers like Apple and Dell. Biopharmaceuticals are proteins, which means they 2019re more difficult to sterilize than traditional drugs, which are made from stable chemicals. In the Inchon facility, Samsung has built 30,000 liters of production capacity in a sprawling plant filled with large metal vats. It already is at work on its second plant, a so-called 10-pack, or 10 15,000-liter tanks.  201cNo one else in the industry has a 10-pack, 201d says Jenifer Wheat, vice president of global business development and one of more than 60 expatriate veterans of Western pharmaceutical companies Samsung has hired to jump-start the biologics business.  The Samsung Biologics investment will take years to pay off, but already Samsung is finding ways to cash in on it. A 90%-owned unit called Samsung Bioepis makes  201cbiosimilar 201d drugs 2014the generics of biotech 2014and recently said it plans to go public on the Nasdaq market in the U.S. Published reports have valued the generics unit at $7 billion. And the health care initiatives, Samsung says, are but part of a broader strategy of finding ways to marry medical markets with information technology.  201cThere are a lot of maybe-not-so-obvious synergies between the two businesses, 201d says Wheat. The implication is that one of these synergies could even produce a new business built on real innovation someday.  Samsung has a pronounced preference for building its businesses rather than buying them. In part, this is because the South Korean government rewarded it and other chaebol for years for reinvesting their profits in R&D, the better to build the domestic economy. The company also carries the scars of a two-decades-old M&A fiasco, the mid-1990s acquisition of a Southern California computer maker called AST Research. Samsung spent nearly $1 billion on the purchase and then proceeded to lose billions more. The failure haunts Samsung strategists and is a frequently repeated discussion point for why Samsung avoids M&A.  Revenues: $195.8 billion Profit: $21.9 billion Employees: 307,000 Five-year annualized return to shareholders: 11.8%  The company has become more acquisitive of late, but in small ways relative to its size. A U.S.-based venture arm recently bought a software company called SmartThings that addresses the so-called Internet of things market. And earlier this year Samsung 2019s mobile division paid $250 million to buy LoopPay, a mobile-payments startup the company hopes will be its answer to competing offerings from Apple, Google GOOG , and others.  One place where Samsung comes up far short in comparison with Apple is in the development of its own mobile ecosystem. As its Galaxy line of smartphones took off, the company decided it needed to have mobile services to match Apple 2019s and Google 2019s. So it formed a Seoul-based outfit called the Media Solutions Center, funded by its mobile division but operating independently. The media-services group annoyed partners like Google and, worse, produced few hits.  Late last year Samsung quietly dissolved the unit, which had amassed a worldwide staff of 2,0, and reassigned its personnel. Curiously, Samsung left intact the Silicon Valley arm of the media-services unit and hired former Disney DIS executive John Pleasants to run it. Insiders say the hunt for a mobile-services strategy continues. Says venture capitalist Jay Y. Eum, a California-based former Samsung employee:  201cSamsung is the hardest-working technology company in the world. They will not stop until they 2019ve figured it out. 201d  At the beginning of the 1990s, Jay Y. Lee 2019s father realized that Samsung 2019s culture was too inward-looking. So he created a program to each year send 100 of Samsung 2019s most promising middle managers out to visit countries around the world on yearlong sabbaticals to soak up the local culture and return to Korea with new perspectives. It 2019s a tradition that continues. Today, at its headquarters in Seoul, it also employs several hundred non-Koreans with MBAs to work on global strategy, on the assumption that foreigners bring fresh thinking. Samsung has long been a yearning, searching company. And under the next chairman Lee it will attempt to complete the transformation from studying the rest of the world 2019s best practices to internalizing them.  Come December, when Samsung typically announces annual organizational changes, it is quite possible that Jay Y. Lee will be named chairman, whatever his father 2019s health status. In one fell swoop Samsung officially will have a leader whose experience screams out fresh perspectives. Putting them into action will be Jay Y. Lee 2019s challenge for the decades ahead.

Now we know just how cozy.  The public statements sent out by both companies say that Amazon amzn Web Services is now officially Salesforce 2019s crm  201cpreferred public cloud infrastructure provider. 201d  That 2019s pretty fluffy. More newsworthy is that Salesforce will spend $400 million on AWS services over the next four years. That tidbit was found on Salesforce 2019s 10Q statement, although the name of the  201cthird-party provider 201d was not mentioned. Sources close to both companies confirmed that the the provider is AWS.  A public cloud or public cloud infrastructure a la AWS or Microsoft Azure is a massive set of computing, storage and networking resources that are rented out to customers who don 2019t want to expand or run their own data centers.  Get Data Sheet, Fortune 2019s daily newsletter on the business of technology.  The deal, agreed to last month is for Salesforce calls for that company to pay $70 million for AWS in fiscal 2017, $96 million the following year, then $108 million and $126 million.  This does not mean that Salesforce is moving all of its computing jobs off of its own data center infrastructure just yet.  One source said this is Salesforce  201cdipping its toe, 201d albeit a very large toe, in the public cloud. Salesforce 2019s current Heroku software development business acquired a few years back already runs entirely on Amazon infrastructure. The benefit of moving to Amazon could be more flexibility and the fact that Amazon runs data centers around the world, an important consideration given that many countries have strong data sovereignty laws that mandate that customer data be kept in the country of origin.  The deal with AWS is not necessarily indicate that Salesforce is ending its long dependency on Oracle databases and other software. Oracle software can run on corporate data centers but also can run on AWS. But Salesforce, as reported, is seriously weighing a move away from Oracle, as Fortune reported earlier this month.  Salesforce and Amazon get Awfully Chummy  From the Salesforce statement sent Wednesday afternoon:  For the first time, we 2019ll be able to deliver our core services 2014including Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, App Cloud, Community Cloud, Analytics Cloud and more 2014for our international infrastructure expansion. This will enable us to bring new infrastructure online more quickly and efficiently in select international markets.  The deal could prove a plus for both companies.   201cIt 2019s a big deal for AWS as it is the first time it snatches major enterprise software workload since it got Infor a few years ago, 201d said Holger Mueller, analyst with Constellation Research. Infor is a business software company that migrated to AWS a few years ago.  The move could help Salesforce cut capital spending and funnel that money into research and development. Mueller agreed that this is bad news for Oracle, which would no doubt would have loved to claim Salesforce as a big customer for its nascent public cloud. But Salesforce and Oracle compete tooth and nail in the business applications arena.   201cIt does not make sense for Salesforce to operate two cloud infrastructures, 201d Mueller noted. It 2019s likely this deal means  201cSalesforce will move off its own Oracle-based architecture. 201d  So this is big news for AWS which leads the market in public cloud infrastructure but faces growing competition from Microsoft msft and Google goog Cloud Platform.

Catan  2013 formerly known as  201cThe Settlers of Catan 201d 2014has sold over 25 million copies in more than 30 languages, and it has created a cult of rabid fans around the world.  While kids for generations learned about real estate and capitalism by playing Monopoly, these days they are just as likely to be learning financial lessons from Catan.  Reuters talked to a few devoted Catan fans about the key lessons of the game and what parents can pass along to their kids when sitting down to play:  Players are basically playing the role of settlers, trying to build their communities and maximize their resources (wool, wood, brick, ore, and wheat). As a result,  201cit 2019s all about where you start out, 201d says Vinny Bonta of Columbus, Ohio, who represented the U.S. at the world championships in Berlin in 2014 (placing 13th overall).   201cIf you really want a resource like lumber, for instance, you have to place your settlement onto a lumber-producing location in order to get that. So location is everything, 201d Bonta says.  2. Relationships are a valuable commodity  There is a fair amount of trading that goes on in Catan, as players swap resource cards depending on what they need to progress. So the game is not just about luck and rolls of the dice  2013 it is also about who is willing to make deals with you.   201cThat is the biggest point that people miss, 201d says Bonta.  201cIf you are friendly with someone, they are way more willing to trade with you. So socially, I am always talking and trying to build connections with people. 201d  When it comes to trading, do not just think about what you are getting; think about the particular needs of the other player, as well. Memorize their cards if you can, so you know exactly which cards they are holding.   201cDifferent people all have different resources, so each player is going to value those resources differently, 201d says Stuart Ritter, senior financial planner and VP at Baltimore-based money managers T. Rowe Price, who regularly gets clobbered at Catan by his 9-year-old son.  201cI might have a ton of wood, but need something else. That gives you the opportunity to create a win-win trade for both players. 201d  Winning in Catan is not about a lightning strike, like a chess checkmate in a few moves. Just like investing for retirement, it is about having a long-term strategy that may take time to come to fruition. (One popular shirt in Catan 2019s online shop:  201cThe Fastest Way to Victory is Taking the Longest Road. 201d)   201cAchieving a goal is not something you accomplish in one or two turns, 201d says Ritter.  201cSo you really need to be patient in acquiring resources and building the things you want to build, and not going for immediate gratification. 201d  Bet big on one or two resources, and it might work  2013 or it might fail miserably, just as if you bet your retirement portfolio on a single stock.  In the same fashion, try not to get stuck with a single resource. If you do, you may find yourself desperate for others  2013 to construct roads, for instance, you need brick and lumber, while building cities requires ore and wheat. If you are not diversified, you could end up as the victim of some very lopsided trades.   201cBuild on a variety of numbers, where you can gather a variety of resources, 201d says financial planner Steven Starnes of Grand Rapids, Michigan.  201cYou just can 2019t predict for sure what will perform better, so it is important to thoughtfully diversify investments. 201d  You may develop a brilliant path to victory, but the board gets set up differently every game play, and every single move by your opponents can alter the dynamics of the game.  As a result, you need to be prepared to scrap your preconceived notions, and stay nimble enough to change direction when needed.  201cIt is vital to react to what is in front of you and adapt to what is happening, and not get stuck where you were, 201d says Bonta.

For instance, the firm invested in Netflix nflx in 1998, prior to the company 2019s IPO, and still has a significant stake in the streaming video giant.  Peluso joined Gilt in 2013 from Citigroup, where she was the chief marketing and internet officer. She was also the CEO of Travelocity for six years prior to Citigroup c . Also serving on the board of Nike nke , Peluso will be joining TCV as a venture partner, where she will take on a part-time role advising the firm 2019s portfolio, investing in new companies, and more.  Get Data Sheet, Fortune 2019s technology newsletter.  Under Peluso, Gilt had a tumultuous ride to its exit. Valued at $1 billion at one point, the luxury discount e-tailer was one of the leaders in the pack of flash sales sites, including HauteLook, Rue La La, and others. The company even had hopes of an IPO. But in the past few years, reality set in, and it became clear Gilt and others couldn 2019t compete in an e-commerce world dominated by Amazon.  Gilt isn 2019t the only flash sales site to lose steam. Shares in Zulily, a Gilt rival, plunged over 60% following its initial public offering in 2014. Earlier this year, Zulily sold itself to the parent of home shopping channel QVC for $2.4 billion. Ideeli, which had raised over $100 million from investors, was sold to Groupon in 2014 in a fire-sale. Like Gilt, Fab.com was also valued at $1 billion, but sold for $15 million in 2014.  Target Sets Its Eyes on E-Commerce and Classy Stores  As for what advice Peluso would give startups in the e-commerce world, she said that considering the relative  201cchoppy waters 201d in the current economy, entrepreneurs should be paying serious attention to their unit economics, or how much money they are making on each customer and or order. She 2019s also interested in how to bring digital experiences into stores to make the experience better than in the traditional brick and mortar environment.  Peluso is especially passionate about helping foster more women entrepreneurs and leaders, and will be continuing that effort while working at TCV.

            "input": "text:Theranos, the controversial blood-testing startup that has been valued at $9 billion by private investors, recently decided to raise upwards of $200 million in new funding, according to regulatory filings the company made in Delaware (which were first noticed by VCExperts.com).  The new  201cSeries C-3 201d stock authorization filing came just three days before a Wall Street Journal report questioned the efficacy of Theranos 2019s technology, and even suggested that the Silicon Valley company had tried to cheat on its lab proficiency tests. It had been approved by the company 2019s board of directors nearly one month earlier, on Sept. 19.  It is important to note that authorized shares have not necessarily been issued or sold. For example, other filings show that Theranos authorized the sale of 11.7 million  201cSeries C-2 201d shares at $17 a piece back in February 2014. It then increased that amount this past January to a whopping 58.8 million shares at the same $17 per share price. But shortly thereafter, Theranos said in a different filing that it only had issued a total of 32.2 million of the authorized Series C-2 stock.  Theranos does not comment on its fundraising, so it is unclear exactly how much the company has raised to date. That said, the company did share some information for a Fortune cover story published in June 2014, at which time we reported that the company had raised around $400 million in total funding (at the $9 billion valuation). If we assume that it already had sold the first piece of that Series C-2 round, then the extra shares sold this past spring would put its total capital raised at around $750 million. And that 2019s before anything it raises from the new share authorization.  The company also keeps the identifies of its shareholders close to the vest, having previously identified just a small handful like Draper Fisher Jurvetson (which only committed $500,000 in a seed round), ATA Ventures, Tako Ventures, former board member Don Lucas and Oracle ORCL founder Larry Ellison.  Fortune has since learned, however, of several more investors that have never been otherwise disclosed. They include: BlueCross BlueShield Venture Partners, Continental Properties Co., Esoom Enterprise (Taiwan), Jupiter Partners, Palmieri Trust, Partner Fund Management, Dixon Doll, Ray Bingham and B.J. Cassin.  None of the investors Fortune managed to contact confirmed their involvement on the record, but two we spoke with on background said that they receive relatively little financial information from the company.  We also have heard from multiple sources that certain existing Theranos shareholders have been seeking to sell some stock via secondary exchanges, although have been unable to learn the identities of those holders.  A Theranos spokeswoman did not return requests for comment.  Theranos founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes is scheduled to be interviewed next week at the Fortune Global Forum in San Francisco. Summary: Just days before being lambasted by the Wall Street Journal, Theranos planned to sell a lot of new stock.",

How else would you describe the did-not! did-too! brawl that can result when one country crosses another country 2019s invisible line in the playroom that is the South China Sea? How else would you describe the G-8 canceling its playdate in Sochi after Russia climbed over the fence to Ukraine 2019s yard?  Something similar is true of the International Space Station (ISS), the biggest, coolest, most excellent tree house there ever was. Principally built and operated by the U.S., the ISS has welcomed aboard astronauts from 15 different countries, including such space newbies as South Africa, Brazil, The Netherlands and Malaysia. But China? Nuh-uh. Never has happened, never gonna 2019 happen.  China has been barred from the ISS since 2011, when Congress passed a law prohibiting official American contact with the Chinese space program due to concerns about national security.  201cNational security, 201d of course, is the lingua franca excuse for any country to do anything it jolly well wants to do even if it has nothing to do with, you know, the security of the nation. But never mind.  Few people in the U.S. paid much attention to the no-Chinese law, but it 2019s at last taking deserved heat, thanks to a CNN interview with the three Chinese astronauts 2014or taikonauts 2014who flew China 2019s Shenzhou 10 mission in 2013. The network 2019s visit to China 2019s usually closed Space City, which will air on May 30, is a reporting coup, especially because of the entirely familiar, entirely un-scary world it reveals: serious taikonauts doing serious work with serious mission planners 2014every bit what you see behind the scenes at NASA or Russia 2019s Roscosmos.  And similar to the nature of those other space agencies too is the professed wish of the Chinese crews to work across national borders.  201cAs an astronaut, I have a strong desire to fly with astronauts from other countries, 201d said Nie Haisheng, the Shenzhou 10 commander.  201cI also look forward to going to the International Space Station. Space is a family affair; many countries are developing their space programs and China, as a big country, should make our own contributions in this field. 201d  But that contribution can 2019t happen aboard the ISS. The 2011 law draws a sort of ex post facto justification from a study that was released in 2012 by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, warning that China 2019s policymakers  201cview space power as one aspect of a broad international competition in comprehensive national strength and science and technology. 201d More darkly, there is the 2015 report prepared by the University of California, San Diego 2019s Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation, ominously titled  201cChina Dream, Space Dream 201c, which concludes:  201cChina 2019s efforts to use its space program to transform itself into a military, economic, and technological power may come at the expense of U.S. leadership and has serious implications for U.S. interests. 201d  OK, deep, cleansing breaths please. On the surface, the studies make a kind of nervous, reflexive sense. China is big, China is assertive, China has made clear its intentions to project its military power in ways it never has before 2014including to the high ground of space.  But if that sounds familiar it 2019s because it 2019s an echo of the Cold War hysteria that greeted the launch the Soviet Union 2019s Sputnik. The world 2019s first satellite, Sputnik was a terrifying, beach ball sized object that orbited the Earth from Oct. 1957 to January 1958, presenting the clear and present danger that at some point it might beep at us as it flew overhead. Every Soviet space feat that followed was one more log on the Cold War fire, one more reason to conclude that we were in a mortal arms and technology race and woe betide us if the guys on the other side got so much as a peek at what we were doing.  That argument failed for a lot of reasons. For one thing, the Soviets hardly needed a peek at our tech since they were the ones who were winning. When you 2019re in first place in your division you don 2019t to steal ideas from the guys in last. Something similar is true of the Chinese now.  After launching their first solo astronaut in 2003, they have followed in rapid succession with two-person and then three-person crews, and have mastered both spacewalking and orbital docking. They have orbited a core module for their own eventual space station, have sent multiple spacecraft to the moon and are planning a Mars rover. They didn 2019t do all that by filching American tech.  The doubters are unappeased, however. Both these reports warn that all of China 2019s technological know-how, no matter how they acquired it, has multiple uses, and can be put to either good or nefarious ends, a fact that is pretty much true of every, single technological innovation from fire through the Apple Watch.  Even if all of the fears were well-founded 2014even if a Chinese Death Star were under construction at this moment in a mountain lair in Xinjiang 2014forbidding the kind of international handshaking and cooperating that is made possible by a facility like the ISS is precisely the wrong way to to go about reducing the threat. The joint Apollo-Soyuz mission in 1975 achieved little of technological significance, but it was part of a broader thaw between Moscow and Washington. That mattered, in the same way ping pong diplomacy between the U.S. and China in 1971 was about nothing more than a game 2014until it was suddenly about much more.  Well before the ISS was built and occupied, the shuttle was already flying American crews to Russia 2019s Mir space station. Russia later became America 2019s leading partner in operating and building the ISS 2014a shrewd American move that both offloaded some of the cost of the station and provided work for Russian missile engineers who found themselves idle after the Berlin Wall fell and could easily have sold their services to nuclear nasties like North Korea or Iran.  The technology aboard the ISS is not the kind that a Chinese astronaut with ill will would want to or need to steal. And more to the point, if there 2019s one thing the men and women who fly in space will tell you, it 2019s that once they get there, terrestrial politics mean nothing at all 2014the sandbox silliness of politicians who are not relying on the cooperation of a few close crewmates to keep them alive and safe as they race through low Earth orbit. From space, as astronauts like to say, you can 2019t see borders. It 2019s a perspective the lawmakers in Washington could use.

The makers of a popular TV show, though, just took this gripe to a new level.  According to a fan group called The Spoiling Dead, lawyers for the The Walking Dead say they will sue if the group keeps writing about upcoming plot twists.   201cAMC is aware that The Spoiling Dead Fans site is promoting your claim that you have received copyright protected, trade secret information about the most critical plot information in the unreleased next season of The Walking Dead, 201d the letter states.  The  201cmost critical 201d plot info in question reportedly concerns the identity of a person who a character named Negan killed with a barbed-wire covered baseball bat, according to Torrent Freak.

On one hand, the studio may worry that some people might not tune if they already know what becomes of Negan and his bat.  But on the other hand, it seems those who care about spoilers would make a point not to find out. For instance, they could avoid reading the fan site 2019s page in the first place 2014or not looking for the answer in the graphic novels on which the show is based.  More importantly, the studio 2019s legal case seems far-fetched. Anyone with a passing knowledge of copyright law knows that you can protect original expression, but not basic facts. The answer to the mystery of Negan and his bat is just that: a fact.  Imagine if the makers of Star Wars wanted to stop me from telling everyone the identify of Luke Skywalker 2019s father. They certainly could ask, but there 2019s not way they would persuade a judge to stop me.  AMC 2019s lawyers try to bolster their silly claim by citing a case called Twin Peaks v.

But that case is very different 2014it involved publishing large amounts of information and undermining the market for authorized Twin Peaks books.  Alas for the fan site, having the law on your side is not enough to win. You also have to pay for attorneys and all those court filing charges to defend yourselves, which means it can be more practical to just give in. And that appears to be what the site has decided to do. Summary: Copyright is more scary than zombies",

And if it sounds too good to be true, well, there's a saying about that. Unless you have $2,500 to burn (actually, $2,495), you'll want to be very careful before taking them up on their offer.  The Ladders is a job board that specializes in positions paying $100,000 or more. Now it's claiming that its $2,495, six-month coaching service will get you a job offer worth at least $100,000-or your money back. But what if it's for a job you don't want or couldn't take?  Every successful coach, of course, requires a motivated trainee. If you're not motivated, The Ladders has a bunch of stipulations to make sure you at least act as if you are. To be eligible for the guarantee, you have to attend seven sessions with a career coach, complete an evaluation, and, after the first 60 days, apply to six 'well-fitted' positions a month. If you still don't get at least one offer for at least $100,0, The Ladders will refund your money.  Here's the first catch: What, exactly, is a  well-fitted  job? To qualify as well-fitted, The Ladders says a job has meet your goals in three of these five criteria:  So, as I read it, if you're living in Atlanta, and a job in your industry, using your skill set, comes to you through a contact in Anchorage, you're expected to interview for it, and, if successful, pack up and go (or forfeit your $2,495).

Any of them were welcome to keep their jobs if they moved to the company's Midwestern headquarters. If they moved, they could keep their New York salaries. I lived near New York at the time, I knew roughly how much this woman made, and I saw pictures of her house. To me, it seemed like you could live like a king on a New York salary in this part of the country. And out of nearly 200 laid-off people, how many applied for jobs at headquarters? Last I heard, exactly two.  Still, if you're willing to move to-or from-Peoria, consider what  , has to say about Signature before you fork over your money:  Then there's the fact that when Adams asked to interview a successful participant in Signature, her arrangement for an exclusive about the new service was hastily cancelled. Make of that what you will. Or better yet, read  about the service, and the rather pointed comments from job-seekers.  Do you think $2,500--up front--for a good-paying job is a fair deal, even if that job's in another city? Or is it too risky and expensive for someone without a job?   00a9 2011 CBS Interactive Inc..

            "input": "text:Apple Inc. has revolutionized music and phones. Now it is aiming at a much bigger target: automobiles.  The Cupertino, Calif., company has several hundred employees working secretly toward creating an Apple-branded electric vehicle, according to people familiar with the matter. The project, code-named  201cTitan, 201d initially is working on the design of a vehicle that resembles a minivan, one of the people said.  An Apple spokesman declined to comment.  Apple ultimately could decide not to proceed with a car. In addition, many technologies used in an electric car, such as advanced batteries and in-car electronics, could be useful to other Apple products, including the iPhone and iPad.  Apple often investigates technologies and potential products, going as far as building multiple prototypes for some things that it won 2019t ever sell. Any car would take several years to complete and obtain safety certifications.  But the size of the project team and the senior people involved indicate that the company is serious, these people said. Apple executives have flown to Austria to meet with contract manufacturers for high-end cars including the Magna Steyr unit of Canadian auto supplier Magna International Inc. A Magna spokeswoman declined to comment.  Apple 2019s industrial design team is staffed with several people who have experience at European auto makers. Last year, Apple hired Marc Newson, a famous industrial designer and close friend of the company 2019s design guru, Jony Ive. In the past, Mr. Newson created a concept car for Ford Motor Co.  Apple hopes to put its stamp on the electric vehicle market in the same way it did the smartphone with its iPhone, said a person familiar with its work. Even though Apple defied expectations of slowing growth with a 30% rise in revenue in the quarter ended December, the company is under constant scrutiny of where its next breakthrough product will come from.  Earlier this week, Mr. Cook said at an investor conference that he does not believe that companies naturally start to slow as their revenue grows. He said this was  201cdogma 201d and that Apple didn 2019t believe in putting limits on what it was capable of.  A side benefit of the project, according to one of the people, is that it has persuaded many Apple employees who were thinking of leaving the company to stay and work on an exciting new endeavor without the pressure of churning new products every year.  Other Silicon Valley giants are looking at autos. Google Inc. has been working on a self-driving car for years. The head of Google 2019s autonomous vehicle project said last year that the company aims to forge a partnership with auto makers to build a self-driving car within the next few years. A self-driving car is not part of Apple 2019s current plan, one of the people familiar with the project said.   201cThere are products that we 2019re working on that no one knows about, 201d Chief Executive Tim Cook told interviewer Charlie Rose in September.  201cThat haven 2019t been rumored about yet. 201d  Building cars is capital intensive, costing hundreds of millions of dollars for design, tools and production and certifications. Auto makers also must help ramp up a supply network for the thousands of components that go into a vehicle.  Battery-powered cars add another dimension. Tesla Motors Inc., for instance, has seen losses widen amid rising expenses to build an electric sport-utility vehicle. It expects to spend $1.5 billion on capital expenditures and R&D this year.  Mr. Cook approved the car project almost a year ago and assigned veteran product design Vice President Steve Zadesky to lead the group, the people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Zadesky is a former Ford engineer who helped lead the Apple teams that created the iPod and iPhone.  Mr. Zadesky was given permission to create a 1,000-person team and poach employees from different parts of the company, one of the people familiar with the matter said. Working from a private location a few miles from Apple 2019s corporate headquarters in Cupertino, the team is researching different types of robotics, metals and materials consistent with automobile manufacturing, the people said.  In September, Apple hired Johann Jungwirth, who had been the president and chief executive of Mercedes-Benz Research and Development North America, which has operations in Sunnyvale, Calif., near Apple 2019s campus, according to his LinkedIn profile.  The Financial Times reported earlier that dozens of Apple employees are researching automotive products, citing people familiar with the company.  Over the past 15 years, Apple has built a track record of upending industries. Its iPod music players and iTunes service accelerated the shift to digital music. The iPhone established the smartphone market and changed the notion of mobile computing. Apple plans to introduce its Apple Watch in April, which the company hopes will create a market for wearable devices.  Manufacturing a car is enormously expensive. A single plant usually costs well over $1 billion and requires a massive supply chain to produce the more than 10,000 components in a car. Elon Musk, chief executive of electric-car maker Tesla, complained last fall that it is  201creally hard 201d to make a car amid the company 2019s struggle to ramp up production of its Model S sedan.  The expense is a barrier to entry to many potential competitors, but would be less of a hurdle for Apple, which reported holding $178 billion in cash as of Dec. 27, 2014.  Tesla was able to ramp up its manufacturing quickly and relatively cheaply by buying a former Toyota Motor Corp. factory in Fremont, Calif., for $42 million in 2010. Tesla has since invested hundreds of millions of dollars to tool up the factory and still only produced 35,000 vehicles in 2014.  Auto makers tend to operate their own factories. For years, Apple has relied on contract manufacturers to build its products. That has helped Apple keep a lean supply chain and reduce inventory exposure.  Apple has been working with auto makers on bringing its software expertise into the car. More than two dozen auto makers plan to use its CarPlay service, which allows a driver to access Apple services like iTunes music, maps and Siri through the vehicle 2019s dashboard information system.

The conversation was supposed to be about how to completely kill off Jelly and fully commit to their new app, Super, which lets users create and share colorful collages that include a superlative like  201cMy favorite animal is the pug. 201d But as the discussion continued, they decided they couldn 2019t give up on Jelly just yet.   201cBen, this is gonna be really awkward, we 2019re gonna have to tell the team that we 2019re going back to Jelly after we said it would over, 201d Stone told his co-founder.  Get Data Sheet, Fortune 2019s technology newsletter.  To make light of the situation, Stone says he came up with the idea of calling it an  201cun-pivot, 201d a joking take on the popular Silicon Valley term of  201cpivoting, 201d or drastically shifting a company 2019s focus after an initial product flops. Soon enough, the press was having fun with it too. BuzzFeed published a list of  201cHistory 2019s 8 Most Important Un-Pivots, 201d featuring Prohibition and Michael Jordan 2019s return to basketball after a brief stint in minor league baseball.  Surprisingly, the story of how Stone came up with the idea for Jelly isn 2019t all that riveting. As he tells it, the idea occurred to him while taking a walk with Finkel, a close friend of his from Twitter. Finkel, who Stone describes as one of the smartest people around and a talented engineer, soon quit his job at Twitter, and the two started working on Jelly.   201cWe think the future of search in general is no results. You ask a question, you get the answer, 201d said Stone. On the conference room table next to him was an Echo, Amazon 2019s voice-activated gadget for shopping, playing music, or other tasks. Though Jelly was founded before Amazon released the Echo, it 2019s become a good proxy for how Stone envisions the next phase of search engines. Sure, the Echo can 2019t answer any and all questions at the moment, but it also doesn 2019t provide its owner with pages and pages of results to wade through.  For now, getting an answer through Jelly takes anywhere between a few seconds to 10 to 15 minutes, but as the company adds more and more users, Stone hopes it will provide a quicker turnaround. Since every startup needs some sort of vanity metric,  201caverage time to first answer 201d is Jelly 2019s.  Right now, all answers are submitted by users in response to individual questions. Although it sounds crazy that people will voluntary spend their time answering strangers 2019 questions, Stone claims that it 2019s in fact something people want to do.  201cPeople love answering the questions, especially when they know the answer 201d because it 2019s a topic they know well, he said. Users can select topics they 2019re experts in, and the app will route relevant questions to them.  Eventually, Jelly will also start to recycle answers for similar questions and even further down the line, it could also pull information from certain websites and serve up quick answers, similarly to Google 2019s  201cFeatured Snippets, 201d though he wouldn 2019t say more about this.  Jelly is of course not the first attempt at human-powered answers 2014there 2019s already Yahoo Answers, which gained decent traction after it debuted in late 2005, but was then overwhelmed by spammy and low quality responses. Quora, a seven year-old service that is popular with Silicon Valley insiders and has maintained a relatively high quality, is another example.  But perhaps what 2019s most interesting about Stone, is that he seems quite comfortable with the unknown, including whether Jelly will work out at all this second time around.  Stone is quite aware that the idea seems ridiculous to some folks and that he hasn 2019t  201cinvented water, 201d as one critic has said to him. But he also believes there could be space for an alternative to Google.  201cThere 2019s a huge percentage of queries that are better answered by a person, 201d he said, adding that technically, even Google results were written by humans because most things on websites were put there by people.  Asked if he thinks Jelly will be as big as Google, he said he doesn 2019t know.  201cThat would be great, 201d he added casually, though he didn 2019t seem to delude himself too much about this.  Jelly also got  201clucky, 201d as Stone says, when it came to the undisclosed amount of funding he has raised after personally getting the company off the ground. Not too long after raising its first round of institutional funding in 2013, Greylock Partners 2019 Josh Elman approached Stone and asked to participate in his next round, and though Jelly hadn 2019t even begun to spend its first round of venture capital money, Stone accepted.   201cI grew up on welfare and was in debt until I was 37, so I took the money, 201d Stone laughed, adding that  201cin retrospect, it looked like I was a genius. 201d Summary: But does the world need anything beyond Google?",

            "input": "text:Another processed-food giant is slashing jobs and moving its headquarters to Chicago to get leaner and more nimble in the face of changing consumer tastes toward healthier foods.  ConAgra Foods, maker of familiar brands Reddi-wip, Slim Jim and Chef Boyardee, announced Thursday it would cut about 1,500 jobs and locate 700 jobs in a new corporate headquarters in the historic Merchandise Mart.  In doing so, the company follows in the footsteps of Kraft Heinz which, facing similar pressure to deliver greater profits, announced in August the layoffs of 2,500 workers, including 700 locally, and plans to relocate its Chicago-area offices to downtown Chicago.  For decades, ConAgra has been based in Omaha while maintaining a Chicago-area presence, most recently with a Naperville office that employs about 400 people. But hampered in recent years by a flagging private-label business and challenges selling processed foods to a more educated consumer, new CEO Sean Connolly seized upon an opportunity  2014 sweetened by state incentives  2014 to cut costs and reposition the company for the future.  Connolly, who called the cuts  201cdifficult but necessary, 201d said in an interview Thursday that relocating the headquarters to Chicago was a strategic move to house the executive team and consolidated consumer foods departments under one roof instead of in separate states.   201cI want to be with the business, 201d said Connolly, who lives in Winnetka.  201cAnd I expect my executives to be with the business too. 201d  For example, jobs supporting the frozen food brand Banquet are in Omaha while Chef Boyardee is supported by employees in Naperville. Going forward, the grocery, frozen and snack departments will be together at the Merchandise Mart.  The 1,500 job cuts represent about 30 percent of the company 2019s global office-based workforce. The restructuring is expected to result in about $300 million in savings over the next three years, ConAgra said.  The cuts will  201cunfold in an orderly fashion 201d over the next 12 months, Connolly said.  Of those 700 jobs in the new Chicago headquarters, 550 will be relocated from Naperville and Omaha, a company spokesman said.  ConAgra expects to eliminate about 60 jobs in Naperville and another 220 to 250 jobs there will move downtown, the spokesman said. It's unclear what will happen to the remainder; a spokesman said more planning was needed to iron out the details.  About 1,000 or so jobs will be cut from the Omaha offices, with another 300 positions relocated to the new Chicago office.  In a news conference Thursday, Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert said the cuts were  201ceven worse 201d than expected, despite attempts by ConAgra executives to assure her they wouldn 2019t be so severe. About 1,200 jobs will remain in Nebraska.  A delighted Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said he met with Connolly to discuss the relocation Aug. 10.  Thursday, Emanuel touted Chicago 2019s educated workforce, its transportation links, its business community and overall vibrancy as the keys to wooing an increasing number of corporate headquarters to the city.  Asked why, if Chicago was so attractive a proposition, ConAgra also had to be wooed by the governor with tax incentives, Emanuel said  201cthat is a question for the state 201d but noted that Nebraska was also aggressively courting ConAgra to remain in Omaha.  201cOur incentives are the skill and knowledge of our workforce, 201d he said of Chicago.  Gov. Bruce Rauner earlier this year agreed to offer ConAgra tax credits through the Economic Development for a Growing Economy program, or EDGE, in return for a promise to bring at least 150 jobs to Illinois and to keep them here for at least 15 years, according to Illinois Commerce and Economic Opportunity spokeswoman Lyndsey Walters.  The governor has since ordered a halt to such incentives until the state 2019s budget impasse is resolved.  While ConAgra and the state have declined to detail the ultimate value of the tax credits, an estimate using Bureau of Labor Statistics salary data for management positions in the Chicago area of $111,980 suggests that ConAgra could be handed a reduction of at least $630,000 a year on its corporate tax bill if it employs the minimum of 150 new workers in Illinois.  Using the same salary estimates, the tax break could double to $1.26 million a year if ConAgra brings 300 workers into the state.   201cThat 2019s certainly appreciated, 201d Connolly said of the incentives.  201cYou can 2019t fail to have appreciation in that, particularly with the state of things in Illinois. 201d   201cWe look forward to the opportunities created by ConAgra 2019s decision to invest in Illinois, and welcome them to their new home, 201d Rauner said in a statement.  In Naperville, there was disappointment with ConAgra 2019s decision, along with recognition that it might be a boon to Chicago and to Illinois overall.   201cThis certainly is not good news for Naperville, 201d said state Rep. Grant Wehrli, R-Naperville.  201cShifting hundreds of jobs from one community to another creates winners and losers within our own state. 201d  Wehrli called on Rauner to work with the Naperville community to replace the hundreds of local jobs that will be lost.  201cI know the governor worked hard to bring these jobs to Chicago, 201d Wehrli said.  201cNow he needs to work equally hard to help us bring jobs back to Naperville. 201d  Naperville Mayor Steve Chirico said he was not pleased with ConAgra 2019s decision to leave the western suburb, but he is happy with the  201cbig win for the state of Illinois. 201d  At the landmark Merchandise Mart along the Chicago River, ConAgra will lease about 168,000 square feet on the building 2019s 13th floor, adding its name to a directory of corporate tenants in the Art Deco building that includes Motorola Mobility, Yelp, Regus, Publicis and the 1871 startup incubator. The building 2019s owners, Vornado Realty Trust, have repurposed the mart as office space since the traditional trade show business moved online and to Las Vegas.  Like other large food conglomerates, ConAgra has struggled to adapt as consumers trend away from traditional processed, packaged foods toward healthier options.  In its first fiscal quarter that ended May 31, ConAgra reported a loss of $1.2 billion, or $2.88 a share, compared with a year-ago profit of $482.3 million, or $1.14 a share. Included in the quarter was a write-down tied to plans to sell its private-label business later this fall.  First-quarter sales totaled $2.8 billion, up only 1 percent from a year ago.  Jana Partners, the hedge fund that took a stake in Walgreens last year and pushed for change, acquired a 7.2 percent stake and seats on ConAgra 2019s board in July.  Connolly,50, was hired in April to turn the company around and, under pressure from activist investors, has vowed to divest the private label business. ConAgra 2019s board hoped he could repeat the trick he performed at Hillshire Brands, which was bought by Tyson Foods last year after Connolly helped it expand into more fashionable areas including gluten-free foods and high-protein snacks.  The acquisition of private-label business Ralcorp in 2013 under previous management has been a drag on ConAgra 2019s operations, and Treehouse Foods is considered a likely suitor for it.  A Treehouse spokesman on Thursday declined to  201ccomment on speculation. 201d  Gary Karp, executive vice president at market research firm Technomic, lauded Connolly 2019s leadership and vision with the restructuring plan, saying it would attract top talent to the new Chicago location.  201cI give them high marks for courage and high marks for strategic approach, 201d Karp said.  In the years to come, consumers will continue to demand healthier food with greater labeling transparency and better-quality ingredients, Karp said.  201cAll of these trends are going to continue, and we do believe that ConAgra is going to make it a key plank in their strategy, 201d Karp said.  ConAgra had 32,900 employees as of May 31.  Its largest customer is Wal-Mart Stores, which accounted for 18 percent of annual sales.  Jane Donahue, a Naperville Sun freelancer, contributed.

            "input": "text:WATERLOO, Ontario 2014 BlackBerry Ltd.  2019s plan to expand its mobile software and services operations helped the smartphone maker 2019s bottom line in its latest quarter, but sliding handset sales weighed heavily on revenue, which fell 39%.  The Canadian smartphone maker has been focusing on mobile-device software and services for governments and businesses to drive growth after falling far behind in the consumer smartphone market.  BlackBerry 2019s software and services operations generated $166 million in sales in its fiscal first quarter, up about 8% from the previous quarter. After surpassing its goal of $500 million in sales from those operations in its last fiscal year, BlackBerry continues to expect the segment to generate 30% revenue growth this fiscal year.  Still, a continuing decline in handset sales helped push revenue down to $400 million in the quarter ended May 31. That missed both analyst and company expectations.  Since John Chen took over as chief executive of BlackBerry in late 2013, he has aimed to make the company 2019s hardware business profitable, while emphasizing its mobile software tools as drivers of growth. To bolster its software business, the company has acquired a string of mobile security firms over the past year and released many software updates aimed at email, mobile security and crisis communications in the cloud.  Software tools are more profitable than handsets for BlackBerry and fit with the company 2019s expectations that it will see increased demand as wireless-network use moves beyond smartphones and laptops to include a range of consumer and industrial products.  BlackBerry said more than 3,300 new and existing clients signed up for software offerings in the quarter and about 74% of its software revenue in the latest quarter was recurring.   201cWe 2019re very pleased with the momentum, 201d said Mr. Chen on a conference call early Thursday.  201cOur software business continues to achieve scale and traction, resulting in robust growth and increased market share. 201d  BlackBerry shares were recently up nearly 4% at $7.  Hurdles remain in BlackBerry 2019s handset operations, where its offerings have fallen well behind competitors such as Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co.  Analysts say the company 2019s Android-equipped Priv, a high-end phone that incorporates BlackBerry 2019s vaunted mobile security features alongside a bevy of consumer-friendly apps available from Google, hasn 2019t been a hit. BlackBerry hasn 2019t released Priv sales, but Mr. Chen said at $700, the device was too expensive for its customers. Two lower-cost Android-equipped devices are expected to be announced in July, one of which will be a full-screen touch device, Mr. Chen said.  The company sold about 500,000 handset devices in the latest quarter at an average selling price of $290, BlackBerry Chief Financial Officer James Yersh said on Thursday 2019s call. Device numbers are down from 600,000 sold in the fourth quarter and 700,000 in the third quarter.  Mr. Chen said BlackBerry 2019s top objective for the year is to ensure the mobile-device business is profitable and expects the segment to reach that milestone by the third quarter of the current fiscal year.  He added that while there are no immediate plans to stop making devices, the company now considers itself a  201cdesign house 201d rather than a smartphone maker. Manufacturing has been handed over to factories in Asia to reduce costs, he said. Analysts remain mixed on the future of BlackBerry 2019s handset business.   201cWe continue to believe that hardware is not essential to the business and therefore could be exited if a recovery in the segment does not occur, leaving a more profitable company, 201d said Daniel Chan, a TD Securities Inc. technology analyst.  BlackBerry posted a steep loss of $670 million in its latest quarter, hurt by a number of one-time items. The biggest was a $501 million charge for long-lived assets, which Mr. Chen said included hardware contracts and royalty agreements that were no longer relevant. BlackBerry also took a $57 million goodwill impairment charge and a $41 million inventory-related charge.  Adjusted to exclude items, BlackBerry had a small loss of $1 million, or break-even on a per-share basis. That is better than the 8-cent loss analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected.  For its current fiscal year, BlackBerry expects an adjusted loss of about 15 cents a share, much smaller than the 33-cent loss analysts expect.

Thus, the two companies announced a pilot program that could achieve both goals.  Under a pilot program, Vroom will offer cash to select eBay sellers who have not received or chosen to accept offers for their vehicles at the end of their listing periods. A seller can submit his or her vehicle identification number, photos, and details of the car to Vroom, which will provide a cash voucher in return.There are also certain eligibility conditions for the vehicle, related to age, mileage, and title. If the seller accepts the cash offer, Vroom will pick up car from the seller 2019s front door anywhere in the United States.  The program will launch in the third quarter. The partnership comes at a time when companies like Vroom are surging past eBay 2019s own online automotive business. eBay Motors, which launched in 2000, was the go-to place (at least online) for car owners and dealers to find buyers. The business boomed. In 2005, eBay ebay processed $13 billion worth of vehicle and parts sales.  But local marketplace Craigslist and other online car sites, such as Carmax, started to erode some of eBay 2019s business. An explosion of online car startups, including Vroom, Beepi, Carvana, and Shift have taken over the marketplace; eBay 2019s car and parts business has dropped by nearly 30% in the past five years, according to analyst estimates.  Get Data Sheet, Fortune 2019s technology newsletter  eBay is trying to grab some of that business back through acquisitions and strategic partnerships. In March, the company bought Cargigi, an advertising services startup that helps car dealers post sales listing on online classified sites.  Unlike other online car retailers that create marketplaces for people to sell cars to each other, Vroom handles the entire transaction. The company takes possession of the used car from the seller, reconditions it, and then delivers it to the buyer 2019s door. The goal is to make buying or selling a used car as quick and painless as ordering an Uber.  For more about why consumers are avoiding car dealerships, watch:  In December, Vroom raised $95 million in equity and used some of those funds to acquire Texas Auto Direct, a competitor known for developing software that significantly reduces the time it takes to process and recondition used vehicles.

            "input": "text:This Friday, ABC Sports will begin 180 hours of television coverage of the Summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles. A lot of what viewers will see during that time - that is, when sprinters aren't sprinting, hurdlers aren't hurdling and someone isn't selling beer or radial tires - will be ''graphics,'' a vast array of colorful visual images ranging from the familiar, five-ring Olympic logo (with the letters ABC intertwined) to animated diagrams of the 400-meter medley event in swimming.  For the past three years a team of artists and engineers has been cloistered on the fifth floor of the ABC studios at 70th Street and Broadway, preparing first for the Winter Olympics last February in Sarajevo and then the summer Games. For up to 20 hours a day, they have been assembling words, pictures and symbols on machines with space-age names like the Quantel Paintbox, the Dubner CDC (for Character Background Generator) and Chyron. Some of the resulting images turn somersaults a gold medal gymnast would be proud of.  These eye-catching graphics, made possible by recent advances in computer technology, are an obvious lure to viewers, many of whom are young and frequently exposed to the visual pyrotechnics served up by films and video arcade games. As such, their journalistic merit has often been questioned. Yet while they acknowledge a need to maintain an ''up-to- date'' image, those responsible for news and sports graphics on television steadfastly defend their use. ''We started using graphics as a means of conveying information,'' said Hy Bley, graphic director of ABC Sports, ''and that's still their primary function.''  Though ABC is the only network televising the Olympics, it is not alone in its emphasis on graphics. All three networks have been at hard at work on material for their election- year news coverage, and NBC has, for the past year, been giving its news department what amounts to a graphics facelift. The network has increased its artistic staff by 30 percent, to more than 50, and invested in no fewer than nine Paintboxes. These devices, which allow an artist to draw directly onto a screen with an electronic stylus, cost about $150,000 apiece.  All of this was done, according to Thomas R. Wolzien, NBC vice president for news production and program development, in response to concerns voiced by network executives and officials of affiliate stations that, when it came to graphics, NBC was not, well, exciting enough. ''Until about a year ago,'' Mr. Wolzein said in a recent interview at his office in Rockefeller Center, ''NBC was considered pretty stodgy.''  Not any more. Every evening now the ''NBC Nightly News'' comes flying onto the screen with the image of a rolling, blue-and-gold globe, over which appear digital letters spelling the name of the program, and many news reports are accompanied by vivid graphics. A story on the rising cost of child care, for instance, is accompanied by an animated drawing of a calculator, onto which statistics are projected. An election report from Connecticut opens with an animated map of the United States, which rotates onto its back (so to speak) while the Nutmeg State simultaneously rises up and changes color.  Mr. Wolzien and his staff are particularly proud of a spectacular, 30-second sequence that opens NBC's reports on the space shuttle Challenger. In it, videotape footage of the shuttle performing various manuevers - blasting off, soaring into the stratosphere, landing softly - is interspersed with shots of the astronauts at work in the spacecraft. The word ''insterspersed'' is used advisedly because it by no means does justice to the electronic hoops through which these various pictures jump, to dramatic background music specially composed by Henry Mancini.  ''A million and a half dollars worth of equipment was used to put that together,'' said Mr. Wolzien at the end of the 30 seconds. That equipment included most of the big guns in NBC's graphics arsenal, among them a state-of-the-art computer animation machine known, appropriately enough, as the Mirage. According to Mr. Wolzien, the Mirage can ''take a picture, squash it, roll it into a ball, explode it, anything you want.''  In terms of graphics, television has come a long way from the Sputnik era, when one network's depiction of the satellite was a golf ball strung on a piece of coat-hanger wire against a dark cardboard background. To simulate stars, small holes were cut in the cardboard and a light was shone behind it. In fact, many of the significant advances in television graphics technology have come in the past four or five years, since the digital animation machines that the networks now rely on first became available.  These include the Dubner - named for its inventor, Harvey Dubner of Fort Lee, N. J. - which can be programmed to manipulate graphic images in a virtually endless variety of ways; Chyron, a machine that generates numbers and characters in all shapes and sizes, and the Paintbox. Of these, the latter is the most versatile in that it combines a sophisticated computer memory with the talents of the graphic artist: the artist draws with a stylus onto a ''bit pad,'' a plastic board with electronic sensors underneath; the sensors then transmit the artist's renderings directly onto the screen.

Rise Up October asserts that there are  201cover 1,000 people a year killed by police. 201d  Wrong! And more than doubly so.  University of Toledo criminologist Dr. Richard R. Johnson examined the latest data from the FBI and Centers for Disease Control.  From 2003 through 2012, law-enforcement officers killed an average of 429 people per year in  201clegal interventions. 201d These include a relatively small number of innocent people killed by cops and many more who died due to reasonable use of force.  When a bank robber thrusts a loaded Glock into a teller 2019s neck, that 2019s a really good time for the police to kill him.  Anti-police protesters chant the well-known names of several black males who lately have died at the hands of cops: Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Freddie Gray, Tamir Rice and Walter Scott.  Some cops (such as Darren Wilson, who shot Michael Brown) have been exonerated, even by Obama 2019s Justice Department. Others face trial  2014 such as Officer Michael Slager, who shot Walter Scott in the back in North Charleston, SC, and the three white and three black Baltimore cops in whose custody Freddie Gray died.  What this controversy sorely needs is a strong dose of facts. Actual crime data reveal that this movement is based on mythology.  Thanks to the Ferguson Effect, blistering anti-law-enforcement rhetoric and sometimes fatal attacks on police have made cops timid, if not terrified. The result? A murder explosion that, ironically, is killing the very black people whom Black Lives Matter claims to champion. Year to date, homicides are up 8.3 percent in New York, 19.2 percent in Chicago, 51.5 percent in St. Louis and 52.5 percent in Baltimore.  On average,4,472 black men were killed by other black men annually between Jan. 1,2009, and Dec. 31,2012, according to the FBI 2019s Supplementary Homicide Reports. Using FBI and CDC statistics, Professor Johnson calculates that 112 black men, on average, suffered both justified and unjustified police-involved deaths annually during this period.  This equals 2.5 percent of these 4,472 yearly deaths. For every black man  2014 criminal or innocent  2014 killed by a cop, 40 black men were murdered by other black men. The, at most, 2.5 percent of the problem generates relentless rage. And, yet, it is rude-to-racist to mention 97.5 percent of the problem.  As America 2019s largest police force, one would expect the NYPD to be a major player in this alleged mass murder of innocent blacks.  The supposedly trigger-happy, bigoted NYPD killed a whopping eight people last year, according to its meticulous, 73-page  201c2014 Annual Firearms Discharge Report. 201d Of these, four were black. All of them were armed with cutting instruments (scissors, a hatchet, a boxcutter and a knife) and wielded them when they fatally were shot.  Rather than NYPD gunfire, the high-profile Eric Garner case involved a police chokehold that may have given the overweight Garner a lethal coronary.  Still, these five deaths (at least four of them justified) total last year 2019s NYPD  201cgenocide 201d against black men. They equal 4.95 percent of Gotham 2019s 101 black-on-black murders in 2014. Other blacks are 20 times deadlier to black New Yorkers than is the NYPD.  Yes, some police are overzealous, twitchy-fingered and  2014 surely  2014 racist. NYPD Officer James Frascatore 2019s heavy-handed takedown of tennis player James Blake outside a Manhattan hotel in September confirms that some cops need leashes.  But the notion that America 2019s cops simply are gunning down innocent black people is one of today 2019s biggest and deadliest lies.  Deroy Murdock is a Manhattan-based Fox News contributor. Summary: If the Black Lives Matter crowd is correct, bloodthirsty, racist cops are blasting black men like clay pigeons at a shooting range. The pace of this alleged slaughter is breathtaking.  201cEvery 28 hou 2026",

            "input": "text:Kate is just 5 years old when her father, British comedian Richard Beckinsale, dies of a heart attack in his sleep. Richard,31, was at the height of his acting career as the star of the English sitcoms Rising Damp and Porridge.  It stayed with me, the incredible shock and huge loss,  she tells PEOPLE.  I started expecting bad things to happen, that friends will leave, that loved ones will die. It kept building until I had a nervous breakdown when I was a teenager.   Still grieving for her father, Beckinsale develops anorexia around age 15 and withers to just 70 lbs. She asks her mother and stepfather to send her to Freudian psychoanalysis, and she attends sessions five days a week for four years.  It opened my eyes to things, not to be afraid of facing these fears,  she tells PEOPLE.  I at least understood what they were and where they had come from.   Beckinsale stars in Kenneth Branaugh's Much Ado About Nothing, in which she plays Hero, a maiden who is the sole heiress to her father's fortune. Two years later, Beckinsale drops out of the University of Oxford to focus on acting, before heating up across the pond with roles in The Last Days of Disco and Brokedown Palace.  While performing in the touring play, The Seagull, Beckinsale meets Welsh actor Michael Sheen. The couple begins a nine-year relationship.  Beckinsale gives birth to her and Sheen's only child, daughter Lily.  I was brilliant at breastfeeding,  she tells Allure in July 2006.  I was like an overproducing cow. I miss it a bit.   Beckinsale stars in her highest profile film yet: World War II blockbuster Pearl Harbor, with Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett. While training for her role as a nurse, the actress practices giving shots to a bevy of men.  All these boys would come in and drop their trousers, and I would stab and inject them,  she tells Playboy.  It was an odd day.   Beckinsale's next film, the romantic comedy Serendipity, with John Cusack, comes out. She began shooting the film while wrapping Harbor and tells the Bergen Record,  They saved the kissing scenes in Pearl Harbor for the last week, and me and John had all of our kissing scenes in the first week. There was a point when I was ricocheting between New York and L.A., madly kissing everybody.   While filming Underworld together in Budapest, Sheen and Beckinsale meet director Len Wiseman. Wiseman directs the couple in the supernatural thriller about the secret history of vampires and werewolves, which opens at No. 1 and grosses $ 95.7 million worldwide.  Shortly after Sheen and Beckinsale's move from London to L.A., the pair breaks up. Reports surface that Beckinsale left Sheen for Wiseman. The British beauty denies any infidelity.  Yes, I've been completely monogamous,  Beckinsale tells Allure in 2006.  It was always rather odd to me when I'd get that 'Oh, what a slut' remark. 'Oh, she ditched the father of her child and ran off with somebody else.' I mean, look around this town and tell me one other person who's slept with only two people in a decade. I might just be the only one.   After dating for months, Wiseman proposes to Beckinsale over dinner at Santa Monica's Viceroy Hotel, where he requests a cabana by the pool, a presidential suite filled with white lilies and a special type of merlot.

            "input": "text:SAN FRANCISCO  2014 In a summer of political and racial tumult, young Americans are in a dour mood: pessimistic about the fairness of their economic system, questioning the greatness of the United States and deeply skeptical of the way the nation picks its leaders.  A new poll of young people between the ages of 18 and 30 finds that an overwhelming 90 percent think the two-party political system has real  2014 though fixable  2014 problems or that it is  201cseriously broken. 201d Three-quarters believe the U.S. is  201cfalling behind 201d or  201cfailing 201d as a nation.  Just over half say the chance to get ahead economically is reserved for only a few people at the top.  Though the new GenForward survey is a poll of all young people, not necessarily registered or likely voters, it nevertheless shows clear discontent with the two major-party candidates for president. Only 39 percent of young people have a favorable opinion of Hillary Clinton. Just 19 percent think well of Donald Trump.  The generation that is the most educated, diverse and indebted in U.S. history is still pining for the candidate who only this week left the race: Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.   201cMillennials, unfortunately, are subject to an economic and political future that is not of their own making, 201d said Sarah Swanbeck, executive director of the Center on Governing & Investing in the Future at the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California, Berkeley.  201cIt 2019s no surprise then that young adults across the country have increasingly turned to  2018political outsiders 2019 promising to reform the system. 201d  GenForward is a survey by the Black Youth Project at the University of Chicago with the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. The first-of-its-kind poll pays special attention to the voices of young adults of color, highlighting how race and ethnicity shape the opinions of a new generation.  There 2019s a strong desire among young people of all races and ethnicities for a third-party challenger to Trump and Clinton: 72 percent of Latinos and whites, 67 percent of Asian-Americans and 63 percent of African-Americans.   201cThe candidates we 2019re left with are very similar, 201d said Alejandro Ochoa, a 21-year-old from Adelanto, California.  201cI say that they 2019re similar mainly because they 2019re both rich, and I get the sense that they 2019re going to look out more for the 1 percent and not the rest of us. 201d  Only 5 percent of respondents said the United States is greater than ever, with an additional 14 percent saying it 2019s as great as it has been in the past. More than half said the country is  201cfalling behind 201d and a quarter said it 2019s  201cfailing. 201d  It [the survey] nevertheless shows clear discontent with the two major-party candidates for president.  Young whites expressed the greatest dismay, with 84 percent saying the country is falling behind or failing. About two-thirds of young Latinos, Asian-Americans and African-Americans thought so.  Lakevia Davis, a 24-year-old college student in Montgomery, Alabama, is among the 23 percent of African-Americans who say the country is failing. Davis worries that her older brother or father could be shot and killed by police. She wonders if the U.S. will ever have a president who can address what she sees as inequities and fear seared into the country.   201cI just feel like a lot of the times we 2019re forced to pick the lesser of two evils rather than the right candidate, 201d said Davis, who supported Sanders.  A quarter of young people overall say the distribution of wealth and money is fair, but while 32 percent of whites said so, only 12 percent of African-Americans agreed. About 20 percent of Asian-Americans and Latinos said distribution is fair.  Overall, 54 percent said that only a few people at the top have a chance to get ahead, while the remainder said that anyone can rise economically. Those figures were consistent for all races and ethnicities.  Matthew Monnot, an assistant professor at the University of San Francisco School of Management, said wages haven 2019t grown for decades and have, in fact, decreased for lower-paid professions while increasing dramatically for those at the top.   201cIt 2019s been completely stagnant, 201d Monnot said,  201cso for the people you 2019re surveying, their entire life span has been that of the average worker not having any wage increase. 201d  Young adults are especially sour about the two-party political system. More than a third of respondents said the system is seriously broken, with just 9 percent saying it is working well. The majority, 54 percent, said the system has real problems but can be fixed.  Natalie Woodford, a white 25-year-old doctoral candidate in nutrition and exercise at Virginia Tech, counts herself in that group. She imagines a country that isn 2019t so consumption-oriented, a place where people don 2019t have to pay more to eat healthfully and don 2019t feel that a fat salary equals success.   201cThere 2019s bound to be people out there who are having similar thoughts and at the end of the day want to do what 2019s right, 201d she said.  The poll of 1,965 adults 18-30 was conducted June 14-27 using a sample drawn from the probability-based GenForward panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. young adult population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.  The survey was paid for by the Black Youth Project at the University of Chicago using grants from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and the Ford Foundation.  Respondents were first selected randomly using address-based sampling methods, and later interviewed online or by phone.

            "input": "text:Even for investors who lived through the bear market of the 1970's, the relentless slide of stocks since March has been deeply disturbing.  Markets rarely move in one direction, whether straight down or straight up. Yet for the last four months, stocks have plunged day after day, and week after week, climaxing with Friday's 390-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average.  Optimistic comments about the economy from Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, and better-than-expected profit reports from some companies have not stopped the skid. Speeches by President Bush meant to reassure investors have instead seemed to frighten them.  But if history offers one certainty, it is that the slide will not go on forever, and investors who have the fortitude to step in just when the market looks its worst will probably be rewarded.  So what might stop the skid? Here are five possibilities: Stock buybacks, the Federal Reserve, the Bush administration, small investors and the market itself.  After the crash of 1987, many companies announced plans to buy back their own stock, providing a strong signal that they thought that their shares were cheap. But in this downturn, the effect of buybacks has been more muted. Many companies already buy back shares regularly to offset the additional shares issued as a result of stock option grants they give employees, so announcements of buyback programs do not send as strong a message as they did 15 years ago.  To compensate, companies could expand their buyback plans. But buybacks eat up corporate cash, and when the debt markets are unsettled and the economy uncertain, many chief executives are wary of spending money if they do not have to do so.  Still, if stock prices continue to fall, expect to see more announcements of expanded buybacks and more executives buying their companies' stock in the market, rather than through options programs. Insider buying, if it happens, would be a strongly bullish signal.  The Federal Reserve can also help. When the Dow gained 40 points in the last 90 minutes of trading last Tuesday, the tight-knit community of hedge fund managers was filled with rumors that the Fed had somehow intervened to prop up stocks. The idea that the Fed had directly bought stocks is far-fetched, to say the least.  But the Fed does have at least three ways to support stocks indirectly. It can buy Treasury bonds and notes from banks, an action that puts more cash into the banking system. It can also lower short-term interest rates, a step that should help the economy by decreasing the cost of borrowing.  Lower rates might also encourage investors to take some of their savings out of money market funds and put them into stocks.  With the support of the Treasury Department, the Fed can also step into the currency markets to support the dollar, whose recent fall has been a burden on stocks.  But it is far from clear that the Fed thinks it needs to intervene. The sell-off has been orderly until now, and stocks are hardly trading at bargain levels. Mr. Greenspan may well view the downturn as painful but necessary to correct the speculative excesses of the bubble, and refrain from action as long as the plunge does not seem to be hurting the real economy.  The Bush administration  2014 including the president and his economic team  2014 have had little success so far in their efforts to restore confidence. Despite the federal government's rising budget deficit, the president's main economic priority appears to be making permanent a tax cut that was conceived during a surplus and would favor the richest Americans.  Paul H. O'Neill, the Treasury secretary, carries relatively little weight on Wall Street or in Washington.  Meanwhile, Harvey L. Pitt, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, has become the focus of scorn among many investors for his ties to the accounting industry at a time when corporate accounting is in its worst shape since before the S.E.C. was created. To many investors, Mr. Pitt appears to have been slow to grasp the seriousness of the problem, and some of them say his proposed reforms have been weak.  Wall Street might greet a change at the top of the S.E.C. or the Treasury Department as a sign of the president's great concern about the market's slide.  A wave of buying from small investors, either directly or through mutual funds, would also provide important short-term support.  But individuals appear increasingly panicked by the plunge. After buying funds almost every week between October and May, investors have sold shares for each of the last six weeks, and the redemptions are accelerating, said Thomas McManus of Banc of America Securities. For the week ending last Wednesday, investors sold $11 billion in stock funds.  As a result, instead of propping up the market, small investors appear to be worsening its slide, at least for the time being.  In the short run, the best reason to expect a strong rally is the market itself. Stocks do not move one way forever. Most technical indicators, like the ratio of stocks falling to stocks rising, show the market is overdue for a sharp turn. Summary: If history offers one certainty, it is that the slide on Wall Street will not go on forever. A look at five possible reasons for a rebound.",

            "input": "text:Robert R. Johnson is president and CEO of the American College of Financial Services and co-author of the recent McGraw-Hill book, Invest With The Fed.  The stock market is considered one of the most reliable leading economic indicators. Since Brexit, U.S. markets have not only bounced back, but several indexes have set all-time highs. Among other factors, this is because Hillary Clinton will likely win the presidency in November. Donald Trump continues to find ways to blunder 2014for example, the recent dust up around his six-pointed star tweet that was widely criticized for being anti-Semitic. And while many of the polls have tightened in recent days, the conventional wisdom continues to suggest that Clinton 2019s campaign infrastructure is much stronger than Trump 2019s and will deliver a victory. That is welcome news to investors.  While Clinton is far from the ideal candidate, Trump is downright dangerous from Wall Street 2019s perspective. The danger factor centers on the uncertainty around the myriad of economic disruptions posed by a Trump presidency. There is a timeworn adage that  201cWall Street hates uncertainty, 201d and uncertainty is a characteristic Trump fully embraces. Even former presidential candidate Ben Carson, a Trump supporter, referred to him as  201cunpredictable 201d earlier this week. From his proposals to tear up trade agreements, lower both corporate and individual tax rates, deport undocumented immigrants, and build a wall on the border with Mexico, Trump has advanced a collection of disjointed ideas, backed by few specifics and little information on how these plans would be financed.  The consensus of the markets is that we know much more about what we 2019re getting with Clinton than Trump. Wall Streeters are speaking with their checkbooks, and Trump is getting a tepid monetary response from a constituency that 2019s generally very friendly to the Republican nominee. This is despite the fact that from the beginning of her presidential run, Clinton has advocated for policies that Wall Street hates, including increasing the minimum wage, paid for in large part by higher taxes on high-income Americans.  What is most troubling to financial market participants is that Clinton 2019s primary battle with Bernie Sanders has forced her to lean more heavily to the left than Wall Street finds comfortable. Perhaps the largest impact of Sanders on Clinton 2019s positioning has been on global trade. Clinton entered the race as a staunch supporter of free trade and has since been forced to adopt Sanders 2019 stance opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Ironically, this is one of the few areas in which Clinton and Trump now seemingly agree.  The strong campaign run by Sanders has also forced Clinton to show support for free college tuition at state colleges and universities for those from families below top-income earners. While such a proposal is unlikely to pass muster if Republicans hang on to the House and Senate, sweeping additions to already-burdensome entitlement programs give market watchers significant heartburn.  While Clinton has taken a left-hand turn in recent weeks, the markets are hopeful that she 2019ll take a page from her husband 2019s playbook and campaign from the left and govern from the middle. The most plausible possible derailer of this, from the markets 2019 standpoint, would be a landslide loss by Trump that leaves Democrats in charge of the presidency, House, and Senate. But a Trump victory would concern markets even more. That would shake the markets much more than Brexit, and potentially for a much longer period of time.  Having said that, when asked at the Berkshire Hathaway brk.a Annual Meeting in April about the potential impact of a Trump presidency, Warren Buffett said he does not think that this year 2019s election will change much for Berkshire. He said Berkshire will do just fine, whether Trump or Clinton becomes president, and that no politician can change the long-term outlook for America. That sounds to me like a challenge to Trump. By the way,  201cThe Oracle of Omaha 201d has indicated that he is casting his ballot for Clinton. Summary: Wall Street hates uncertainty.",

            "input": "text:Whatever your approach to footwear and stride, a plethora of scientific research continues to refresh the idea that running has very real and genuine benefits to the Average Joe.  Research released yesterday suggests that men who regularly run long distances should win in the evolutionary battle to reproduce.  Scientists from Cambridge University studied 542 runners at the Robin Hood marathon in Nottingham and found that those who finished faster were more likely to have stronger sex drives and higher sperm counts.  They posit that the good runners are likely to have good stamina in their blood, thanks to ancestors who were excellent persistence hunters. Men who could catch dinner would also have the pick of the females, meaning that they passed down stronger genes to their progeny.   201cThe observation that endurance running ability is connected to reproductive potential in men suggests that women in our hunter-gatherer past were able to observe running as a signal for a good breeding partner, 201d said the study 2019s lead author, Dr Danny Longman.   201cIt was thought that a better hunter would have got more meat, and had a healthier  2013 and larger  2013 family as a consequence of providing more meat for his family.   Telegraph Men columnist Tobias Mews recently ran a marathon while on his honeymoon  Not only is an endurance runner more likely to bring home the bacon, but he also makes for more learned conversation once the food is cooked and set on the table.  Scientists this week discovered that the same bodily process that helps fuel the body efficiently also improves memory and learning.  A single protein, called estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERR 03b3), controls the release of energy to the muscles and the brain. Become good at producing ERR 03b3 and your performance in memory tests as well as marathons should improve.   This is all about getting energy where it's needed to 'the power plants' in the body,  said Prof Ronald Evans, director of Salk Institute for Biological Studies in California.   The heart and muscles need a surge of energy to carry out exercise and neurons need a surge of energy to form new memories.   Anecdotally, there are plenty of instances of great thinkers who have also been impressive runners. Enigma code breaker Alan Turing could run a marathon in two hours 46 minutes; British politician and journalist Matthew Parris managed two hours 32 minutes; while Nobel Prize winning scientist Wolfgang Ketterle once clocked two hours 49 minutes.  Alan Turing almost competed for Britain in the 1948 Olympics  It's long been the insistence of avid runners that going for a jog makes them feel better. To the uninitiated, it can sound like the pious sermon of the faintly unhinged  2013 but there is now concrete scientific evidence to substantiate their claim.  In autumn last year, researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden discovered that aerobic exercise like jogging purges the blood of a substance known as kynurenine, which accumulates during times of stress and is believed to be linked to depression.   201cIt is possible that other kinds of exercise will also have an effect, like resistance training such as weightlifting,  said Dr Jorge Ruas, principal investigator at the Department of Physiology and Pharmacology.  But our results support the use of aerobic exercise like biking and running.   201cSkeletal muscle appears to have a detoxification effect that, when activated, can protect the brain from mental illness. 201d  Exercise is also believed to encourage the body to release serotonin, which improves mood. Ultra-marathon runners often speak of 'surfing a wave of serotonin' while covering the type of distances that make non-runners cringe.  Mo Farah makes history at the Olympic Stadium in 2012 Photo: GETTY IMAGES  It's common sense that an active lifestyle begets a healthy body - but jogging seems to be particularly beneficial when it comes to helping ward off the evils of cancer.  In a wide-ranging paper that was published in 2009, Finnish scientists revealed their conclusions after studying the health of a group of 2,560 middle-aged men over the course of roughly 17 years.  They found that the men who were physically active were the least likely to develop cancer. No surprise there. What was more interesting was that those who ran - or did exercise of a similar intensity - for 30 minutes a day were the most protected, exhibiting  201ca 50 percent reduction in the risk of dying prematurely from cancer, 201d according to Sudhir Kurl, medical director of the School of Public Health and Clinical Nutrition at the University of Kuopio.  According to research conducted at Bellarmine University in Kentucky, US, running increases blood flow to your ears, which results in improved hearing.  Dr. Paul Loprinzi studied 1,082 adult women and concluded that those with higher cardiorespiratory fitness had better hearing function at high and low frequencies. The women with higher aerobic fitness were six per cent more likely to have good hearing than bad hearing.

But we have to do this, not least for the sake of our children. 201d  She is not the only member of Britain 2019s 300,000-strong Jewish community to feel things have reached crisis point. Since the gun attack that killed three people at the Jewish Museum in Brussels last year and the murder by radical Islamists of four Jews at a kosher supermarket on the outskirts of Paris last month, the chorus of concern has been growing. The actress Maureen Lipman recently revealed that she, too, is considering leaving the UK because of the rising number of attacks on Jews.  A poll by the Campaign Against Antisemitism last month found nearly half of Britons thought that at least one anti 2011Semitic view presented to them was  201cdefinitely or probably true 201d.  Then, yesterday, annual figures from the Community Security Trust (CST), which monitors anti-Semitism in Britain, showed a record number of anti 2011Semitic incidents in 2014 (1,168 incidents were recorded, more than double the 535 incidents logged in 2013).  London and Greater Manchester bore the brunt of the increase, with Manchester seeing a 79 per cent rise. One incident cited in the report involved the daubing of swastikas and the term  201cJewish slag 201d on gravestones at a Jewish cemetery in Manchester. Greater Manchester Police says it has stepped up patrols.  The findings are borne out by the Goulds 2019 experience.  201cThe other week, I was standing in the queue at a large supermarket in Manchester when the man in front of me said, 'F------ Jews, they 2019re all over the place.

Honey says:  201cI know there are plenty of people who simply want to live a peaceful coexistence. But there is so much anti 2011Semitism in Britain, and it 2019s coming from all sides.

The far 2011Left habitually conflates Jews with Israel and Zionism, he says. The far 2011Right, meanwhile, may be  201chappy firing salvos at the Muslim population, but I know we are only one step away from their wrath, 201d he says.  Having spent 10 years on the northern board of the CST, he is acutely aware of how bad things have become.  201cI 2019ve been exposed to, and become familiar with, spiralling anti 2011Semitism, 201d he says.  201cEggs hurled from passing cars, swastikas on Jewish headstones, messages of hatred. Last summer, central Manchester  2013 a place I love and have always lived in  2013 became a flashpoint for virulent anti-Israel demonstrations. It was terrifying to see this on the streets of my home city. 201d  He praises the Government 2019s response to the problem, but doubts its ability to stop it.  But how does a family like the Goulds start a new life where they know almost no one? (Honey has a grandmother in California, but the family will be living many hundreds of miles away from her.) One wonders why they don 2019t make Israel their home. Instead, they are relocating to Scottsdale in the Arizona state capital of Phoenix. Home to more than 100,000 Jews, it is a community they believe is large enough for them to feel comfortable in.  The Goulds admit that moving to America is far from easy, however, not least because of the need for a visa and subsequent Green Card. It was only after long hours of research that Simon discovered a little-known scheme called the EB-5 Visa. This awards a Green Card to those who invest in projects in rural regions or areas of high unemployment. Simon is meeting the requirements by making a five-year loan to help fund a large hotel development in Vermont.   201cThere seems to be a tacit belief that the only place for Jews to thrive and flourish is Israel, 201d says Honey.  201cBut in America you get every kind of American: African-American, Chinese-American. We 2019ll be British-American. I 2019m taking my patriotism with me. 201d  In fact it will not be the first time Honey has been uprooted. Born in Manchester, she moved at the age of eight to Iran, where her father had a job as a commodity broker. The family occupied an airy apartment in Tehran and mixed freely among the vibrant Jewish community. But life changed overnight with the overthrow of the Shah in 1979 and the introduction of martial law. Arriving at school one day, 12-year-old Honey and her nine-year-old brother were told they had to go home immediately. Their mother was waiting in tears at the front door and had already started packing their belongings. Within hours, the children were on a flight to London, where they were sent to boarding school. Honey didn 2019t see her parents for a year.   201cI 2019ve known what it is to flee in fear, 201d she says.  201cI don 2019t want to do that again. I want to leave the UK now on my own terms. 201d But she adds sadly:  201cThis was the place where I finally felt safe, that I could finally call home. 201d  Now her own daughter will also be uprooted. But Angel, a thoughtful and circumspect teenager, is in favour of the move.  201cOf course it will be hard, but there 2019s always Facebook to keep in touch, 201d she observes.  201cI 2019m looking at the bigger picture, how things are changing. I want to live in a place where I won 2019t be judged by my religion, where I can hold my head up high. 201d  Arron, meanwhile, has already taken a place to study political science at the University of California, Berkeley. Honey will use her marketing background to look for work, while Simon will pursue business opportunities in the US. He admits he is taking a chance financially, but he is so evangelical about the move that he has set up a website, www.emigrate-to-america.co.uk, offering advice to others on how to make the move.   201cI am the fourth generation of Jew in my family to live in Britain, 201d he says.  201cBritain offered a safe haven, a chance for them to raise a family, build a home. I am eternally grateful for the refuge Britain and its government has given to the Jews. But I can 2019t help feeling that the future is no longer here. The grandfather of one Jewish friend said 'It 2019s time to leave when you are no longer free to sit on a park bench 2019. I think that time is fast approaching. I 2019m leaving before I 2019m told that I have to go. 201d  For more stories, like the Telegraph's Facebook page by clicking on the link below: Summary: After watching the rise in anti-Semitism in this country, the Gould family has   taken the radical decision to emigrate to America.

            "input": "text:The state mounted a PR blitz to show beachgoers that Florida 2019s surf had been spared an oily disaster. Presidential visits aside, it seems social media helped save summer tourism on the Gulf of Mexico  The BP BP Deepwater Horizon spill happened in the middle of nowhere in the Gulf of Mexico, but it also took place, as every event of global import now does, in the realm of social media. The company and the government learned  2014 again  2014 the hard lesson that controlling the information and imagery from the spill is nearly impossible in today 2019s climate. That meant the tourism industry around the gulf faced a big problem  2014 the images, without context, had linked the entire region to the unprecedented number of images of slicks, oil-soaked wildlife and constant footage of the Macondo well gushing millions of gallons of crude, even though parts of the gulf were spotlessly clean.   201cWhen you think gulf tourism, you typically think Florida, 201d says Will Seccombe, chief marketing officer for Visit Florida, the state 2019s tourism division. Tourism is crucial to the state  2014 Florida pulls in about $20 billion in visitor spending annually out of the $34 billion gulf tourism industry. To survive, Florida had to separate itself from the rest of the gulf in the minds of travelers.  On May 11, about three weeks after the spill, Visit Florida launched a marketing campaign that BP would have killed for, taking advantage of the same social media tools that the media used to spread information about the spill. Visit Florida created a website called Florida Live to provide real time information about how the spill was  2014 or rather, wasn 2019t  2014 affecting the coast.  Tourism in Florida 2019s gulf-side panhandle still suffered from the spill, but tourism actually increased statewide last quarter, up 3.4% from the same time last year. The number can mask part of the hit to the tourism industry, says Roger Dow, president and CEO of U.S. Travel. For example, several hotels in the gulf were occupied with BP cleanup workers and media, which skewed the actual tourism statistics. Also, strong numbers in West Palm Beach and Miami this past quarter carried the weight of weak tourism on the coast.  But in these coastal areas, there 2019s evidence that Visit Florida 2019s social media blitz helped.   201cI think Florida Live is a great model, a great best practice for responding to tourism crisis, 201d says Lori Pennington-Gray, a tourism crisis management expert at University of Florida 2019s Center for Tourism Research and Development.  Over the course of the spill, the site added features including live video of beaches, Google GOOG maps and links to resident 2019s Twitter feeds and Flickr pages. It increased Visit Florida 2019s website traffic by 46% compared to the same time last year, and bumped up its Facebook page traffic about tenfold  2014 now the site has over 8,000 fans.  The social media aspect is key for modern tourism, because it connects local Floridians to potential tourists, says Pennington-Gray. Floridians were already shooting video, taking pictures, and making useful comments online. So Visit Florida turned Florida Live into a platform that linked residents 2019 tweets and photos to a Google map. And that simple step  2014 aggregating the positive content that real Floridians and tourists were already creating  2014 helped reinforce to the public and traditional media that Florida 2019s beaches were safe from the oil, at least for sand-castle building purposes.  Many parts to Florida 2019s social media cocktail  The marketing strategy could probably translate to many uses, but there are several reasons why it made sense for Florida, post spill. First of all, Florida 2019s beaches were clean, for the most part. So instead of telling people to come despite of polluted coastal areas, Visit Florida had to figure out how to show people what the beaches actually looked like. Florida was primed to do this because the state government understands the economic importance of tourism. Tourism is top priority in a crisis, says Pennington-Gray. Governor Charlie Crist secured $25 million from BP in mid may to launch Visit Florida 2019s marketing campaign.  The real-time aspect of the marketing campaign was key for this crisis, she adds. Unlike a hurricane, which is a finite event, the oil spill stretched over a long period of time. Visit Florida had to adjust to looming uncertainty about the effects of the spill every day.  201cBy having video cams of the different beaches, it could stay dynamic and be able to respond to those changes on a daily, even hourly basis. 201d  Florida will still have to clear up perception about the spill, says Dow, and the travel industry needs to be active in that effort.  201cNo one in their right mind would have said,  2018let 2019s let the oil spew until this runs out. 2019 This is the same thing. We 2019ve got to cap this perception. 201d  The spill will cost gulf coast economies $22.7 billion* over three years, according to a study commissioned by Oxford Economics. The same study estimates that getting $500 million in funds for effective marketing campaigns could cut that cost by about $7.5 billion.  201cIt makes good business sense, 201d Dow says.  201cBP has said they 2019re going to cover losses. Our point of view is that it 2019s a heck of a lot better for to do preventative work. 201d  Part of that preventative work is for state tourism divisions to have a good social media platform. Florida 2019s is going to stay, says Seccombe.  201cFlorida Live was born out of the oil spill, but the information and the concepts and the tools that were built will live on well beyond. It 2019s shown so much engagement with our visitors to the website, and reinforces the trust message that we try to communicate. 201d  *Editor 2019s note: An earlier version of this story omitted the decimal point in this figure.

            "input": "text:The metaphysical explanation is that Roger Federer is one of those rare, preternatural athletes who appear to be exempt, at least in part, from certain physical laws. Good analogues here include Michael Jordan,(7) who could not only jump inhumanly high but actually hang there a beat or two longer than gravity allows, and Muhammad Ali, who really could  201cfloat 201d across the canvas and land two or three jabs in the clock-time required for one. There are probably a half-dozen other examples since 1960. And Federer is of this type  2014 a type that one could call genius, or mutant, or avatar. He is never hurried or off-balance. The approaching ball hangs, for him, a split-second longer than it ought to. His movements are lithe rather than athletic. Like Ali, Jordan, Maradona, and Gretzky, he seems both less and more substantial than the men he faces. Particularly in the all-white that Wimbledon enjoys getting away with still requiring, he looks like what he may well (I think) be: a creature whose body is both flesh and, somehow, light.  This thing about the ball cooperatively hanging there, slowing down, as if susceptible to the Swiss 2019s will  2014 there 2019s real metaphysical truth here. And in the following anecdote. After a July 7 semifinal in which Federer destroyed Jonas Bjorkman  2014 not just beat him, destroyed him  2014 and just before a requisite post-match news conference in which Bjorkman, who 2019s friendly with Federer, says he was pleased to  201chave the best seat in the house 201d to watch the Swiss  201cplay the nearest to perfection you can play tennis, 201d Federer and Bjorkman are chatting and joking around, and Bjorkman asks him just how unnaturally big the ball was looking to him out there, and Federer confirms that it was  201clike a bowling ball or basketball. 201d He means it just as a bantery, modest way to make Bjorkman feel better, to confirm that he 2019s surprised by how unusually well he played today; but he 2019s also revealing something about what tennis is like for him. Imagine that you 2019re a person with preternaturally good reflexes and coordination and speed, and that you 2019re playing high-level tennis. Your experience, in play, will not be that you possess phenomenal reflexes and speed; rather, it will seem to you that the tennis ball is quite large and slow-moving, and that you always have plenty of time to hit it. That is, you won 2019t experience anything like the (empirically real) quickness and skill that the live audience, watching tennis balls move so fast they hiss and blur, will attribute to you.(8)  Velocity 2019s just one part of it. Now we 2019re getting technical. Tennis is often called a  201cgame of inches, 201d but the clich 00e9 is mostly referring to where a shot lands. In terms of a player 2019s hitting an incoming ball, tennis is actually more a game of micrometers: vanishingly tiny changes around the moment of impact will have large effects on how and where the ball travels. The same principle explains why even the smallest imprecision in aiming a rifle will still cause a miss if the target 2019s far enough away.  By way of illustration, let 2019s slow things way down. Imagine that you, a tennis player, are standing just behind your deuce corner 2019s baseline. A ball is served to your forehand  2014 you pivot (or rotate) so that your side is to the ball 2019s incoming path and start to take your racket back for the forehand return. Keep visualizing up to where you 2019re about halfway into the stroke 2019s forward motion; the incoming ball is now just off your front hip, maybe six inches from point of impact. Consider some of the variables involved here. On the vertical plane, angling your racket face just a couple degrees forward or back will create topspin or slice, respectively; keeping it perpendicular will produce a flat, spinless drive. Horizontally, adjusting the racket face ever so slightly to the left or right, and hitting the ball maybe a millisecond early or late, will result in a cross-court versus down-the-line return. Further slight changes in the curves of your groundstroke 2019s motion and follow-through will help determine how high your return passes over the net, which, together with the speed at which you 2019re swinging (along with certain characteristics of the spin you impart), will affect how deep or shallow in the opponent 2019s court your return lands, how high it bounces, etc. These are just the broadest distinctions, of course  2014 like, there 2019s heavy topspin vs. light topspin, or sharply cross-court vs. only slightly cross-court, etc. There are also the issues of how close you 2019re allowing the ball to get to your body, what grip you 2019re using, the extent to which your knees are bent and or weight 2019s moving forward, and whether you 2019re able simultaneously to watch the ball and to see what your opponent 2019s doing after he serves. These all matter, too. Plus there 2019s the fact that you 2019re not putting a static object into motion here but rather reversing the flight and (to a varying extent) spin of a projectile coming toward you  2014 coming, in the case of pro tennis, at speeds that make conscious thought impossible. Mario Ancic 2019s first serve, for instance, often comes in around 130 m.p.h. Since it 2019s 78 feet from Ancic 2019s baseline to yours, that means it takes 0.41 seconds for his serve to reach you.(9) This is less than the time it takes to blink quickly, twice.  The upshot is that pro tennis involves intervals of time too brief for deliberate action. Temporally, we 2019re more in the operative range of reflexes, purely physical reactions that bypass conscious thought. And yet an effective return of serve depends on a large set of decisions and physical adjustments that are a whole lot more involved and intentional than blinking, jumping when startled, etc.  Successfully returning a hard-served tennis ball requires what 2019s sometimes called  201cthe kinesthetic sense, 201d meaning the ability to control the body and its artificial extensions through complex and very quick systems of tasks. English has a whole cloud of terms for various parts of this ability: feel, touch, form, proprioception, coordination, hand-eye coordination, kinesthesia, grace, control, reflexes, and so on. For promising junior players, refining the kinesthetic sense is the main goal of the extreme daily practice regimens we often hear about.(10) The training here is both muscular and neurological. Hitting thousands of strokes, day after day, develops the ability to do by  201cfeel 201d what cannot be done by regular conscious thought. Repetitive practice like this often looks tedious or even cruel to an outsider, but the outsider can 2019t feel what 2019s going on inside the player  2014 tiny adjustments, over and over, and a sense of each change 2019s effects that gets more and more acute even as it recedes from normal consciousness.(11)  The time and discipline required for serious kinesthetic training are one reason why top pros are usually people who 2019ve devoted most of their waking lives to tennis, starting (at the very latest) in their early teens. It was, for example, at age 13 that Roger Federer finally gave up soccer, and a recognizable childhood, and entered Switzerland 2019s national tennis training center in Ecublens. At 16, he dropped out of classroom studies and started serious international competition.  It was only weeks after quitting school that Federer won Junior Wimbledon. Obviously, this is something that not every junior who devotes himself to tennis can do. Just as obviously, then, there is more than time and training involved  2014 there is also sheer talent, and degrees of it. Extraordinary kinesthetic ability must be present (and measurable) in a kid just to make the years of practice and training worthwhile...but from there, over time, the cream starts to rise and separate. So one type of technical explanation for Federer 2019s dominion is that he 2019s just a bit more kinesthetically talented than the other male pros. Only a little bit, since everyone in the Top 100 is himself kinesthetically gifted  2014 but then, tennis is a game of inches.  This answer is plausible but incomplete. It would probably not have been incomplete in 1980. In 2006, though, it 2019s fair to ask why this kind of talent still matters so much. Recall what is true about dogma and Wimbledon 2019s sign. Kinesthetic virtuoso or no, Roger Federer is now dominating the largest, strongest, fittest, best-trained and -coached field of male pros who 2019ve ever existed, with everyone using a kind of nuclear racket that 2019s said to have made the finer calibrations of kinesthetic sense irrelevant, like trying to whistle Mozart during a Metallica concert.  According to reliable sources, honorary coin-tosser William Caines 2019s backstory is that one day, when he was 2 00bd, his mother found a lump in his tummy, and took him to the doctor, and the lump was diagnosed as a malignant liver tumor. At which point one cannot, of course, imagine...a tiny child undergoing chemo, serious chemo, his mother having to watch, carry him home, nurse him, then bring him back to that place for more chemo. How did she answer her child 2019s question  2014 the big one, the obvious one? And who could answer hers? What could any priest or pastor say that wouldn 2019t be grotesque?  It 2019s 2-1 Nadal in the final 2019s second set, and he 2019s serving. Federer won the first set at love but then flagged a bit, as he sometimes does, and is quickly down a break. Now, on Nadal 2019s ad, there 2019s a 16-stroke point. Nadal is serving a lot faster than he did in Paris, and this one 2019s down the center. Federer floats a soft forehand high over the net, which he can get away with because Nadal never comes in behind his serve. The Spaniard now hits a characteristically heavy topspin forehand deep to Federer 2019s backhand; Federer comes back with an even heavier topspin backhand, almost a clay-court shot. It 2019s unexpected and backs Nadal up, slightly, and his response is a low hard short ball that lands just past the service line 2019s T on Federer 2019s forehand side. Against most other opponents, Federer could simply end the point on a ball like this, but one reason Nadal gives him trouble is that he 2019s faster than the others, can get to stuff they can 2019t; and so Federer here just hits a flat, medium-hard cross-court forehand, going not for a winner but for a low, shallowly angled ball that forces Nadal up and out to the deuce side, his backhand. Nadal, on the run, backhands it hard down the line to Federer 2019s backhand; Federer slices it right back down the same line, slow and floaty with backspin, making Nadal come back to the same spot. Nadal slices the ball right back  2014 three shots now all down the same line  2014 and Federer slices the ball back to the same spot yet again, this one even slower and floatier, and Nadal gets planted and hits a big two-hander back down the same line  2014 it 2019s like Nadal 2019s camped out now on his deuce side; he 2019s no longer moving all the way back to the baseline 2019s center between shots; Federer 2019s hypnotized him a little. Federer now hits a very hard, deep topspin backhand, the kind that hisses, to a point just slightly on the ad side of Nadal 2019s baseline, which Nadal gets to and forehands cross-court; and Federer responds with an even harder, heavier cross-court backhand, baseline-deep and moving so fast that Nadal has to hit the forehand off his back foot and then scramble to get back to center as the shot lands maybe two feet short on Federer 2019s backhand side again. Federer steps to this ball and now hits a totally different cross-court backhand, this one much shorter and sharper-angled, an angle no one would anticipate, and so heavy and blurred with topspin that it lands shallow and just inside the sideline and takes off hard after the bounce, and Nadal can 2019t move in to cut it off and can 2019t get to it laterally along the baseline, because of all the angle and topspin  2014 end of point. It 2019s a spectacular winner, a Federer Moment; but watching it live, you can see that it 2019s also a winner that Federer started setting up four or even five shots earlier. Everything after that first down-the-line slice was designed by the Swiss to maneuver Nadal and lull him and then disrupt his rhythm and balance and open up that last, unimaginable angle  2014 an angle that would have been impossible without extreme topspin.  Extreme topspin is the hallmark of today 2019s power-baseline game. This is something that Wimbledon 2019s sign gets right.(12) Why topspin is so key, though, is not commonly understood. What 2019s commonly understood is that high-tech composite rackets impart much more pace to the ball, rather like aluminum baseball bats as opposed to good old lumber. But that dogma is false. The truth is that, at the same tensile strength, carbon-based composites are lighter than wood, and this allows modern rackets to be a couple ounces lighter and at least an inch wider across the face than the vintage Kramer and Maxply. It 2019s the width of the face that 2019s vital. A wider face means there 2019s more total string area, which means the sweet spot 2019s bigger. With a composite racket, you don 2019t have to meet the ball in the precise geometric center of the strings in order to generate good pace. Nor must you be spot-on to generate topspin, a spin that (recall) requires a tilted face and upwardly curved stroke, brushing over the ball rather than hitting flat through it  2014 this was quite hard to do with wood rackets, because of their smaller face and niggardly sweet spot. Composites 2019 lighter, wider heads and more generous centers let players swing faster and put way more topspin on the ball...and, in turn, the more topspin you put on the ball, the harder you can hit it, because there 2019s more margin for error. Topspin causes the ball to pass high over the net, describe a sharp arc, and come down fast into the opponent 2019s court (instead of maybe soaring out).  So the basic formula here is that composite rackets enable topspin, which in turn enables groundstrokes vastly faster and harder than 20 years ago  2014 it 2019s common now to see male pros pulled up off the ground and halfway around in the air by the force of their strokes, which in the old days was something one saw only in Jimmy Connors.  Connors was not, by the way, the father of the power-baseline game. He whaled mightily from the baseline, true, but his groundstrokes were flat and spinless and had to pass very low over the net. Nor was Bjorn Borg a true power-baseliner. Both Borg and Connors played specialized versions of the classic baseline game, which had evolved as a counterforce to the even more classic serve-and-volley game, which was itself the dominant form of men 2019s power tennis for decades, and of which John McEnroe was the greatest modern exponent. You probably know all this, and may also know that McEnroe toppled Borg and then more or less ruled the men 2019s game until the appearance, around the mid-1980 2019s, of (a) modern composite rackets(13) and (b) Ivan Lendl, who played with an early form of composite and was the true progenitor of power-baseline tennis.(14)  Ivan Lendl was the first top pro whose strokes and tactics appeared to be designed around the special capacities of the composite racket. His goal was to win points from the baseline, via either passing shots or outright winners. His weapon was his groundstrokes, especially his forehand, which he could hit with overwhelming pace because of the amount of topspin he put on the ball. The blend of pace and topspin also allowed Lendl to do something that proved crucial to the advent of the power-baseline game. He could pull off radical, extraordinary angles on hard-hit groundstrokes, mainly because of the speed with which heavy topspin makes the ball dip and land without going wide. In retrospect, this changed the whole physics of aggressive tennis. For decades, it had been angle that made the serve-and-volley game so lethal. The closer one is to the net, the more of the opponent 2019s court is open  2014 the classic advantage of volleying was that you could hit angles that would go way wide if attempted from the baseline or midcourt. But topspin on a groundstroke, if it 2019s really extreme, can bring the ball down fast and shallow enough to exploit many of these same angles. Especially if the groundstroke you 2019re hitting is off a somewhat short ball  2014 the shorter the ball, the more angles are possible. Pace, topspin, and aggressive baseline angles: and lo, it 2019s the power-baseline game.  It wasn 2019t that Ivan Lendl was an immortally great tennis player. He was simply the first top pro to demonstrate what heavy topspin and raw power could achieve from the baseline. And, most important, the achievement was replicable, just like the composite racket. Past a certain threshold of physical talent and training, the main requirements were athleticism, aggression, and superior strength and conditioning. The result (omitting various complications and subspecialties(15)) has been men 2019s pro tennis for the last 20 years: ever bigger, stronger, fitter players generating unprecedented pace and topspin off the ground, trying to force the short or weak ball that they can put away.  Illustrative stat: When Lleyton Hewitt defeated David Nalbandian in the 2002 Wimbledon men 2019s final, there was not one single serve-and-volley point.(16)  The generic power-baseline game is not boring  2014 certainly not compared with the two-second points of old-time serve-and-volley or the moon-ball tedium of classic baseline attrition. But it is somewhat static and limited; it is not, as pundits have publicly feared for years, the evolutionary endpoint of tennis. The player who 2019s shown this to be true is Roger Federer. And he 2019s shown it from within the modern game.  This within is what 2019s important here; this is what a purely neural account leaves out. And it is why sexy attributions like touch and subtlety must not be misunderstood. With Federer, it 2019s not either or. The Swiss has every bit of Lendl and Agassi 2019s pace on his groundstrokes, and leaves the ground when he swings, and can out-hit even Nadal from the backcourt.(17) What 2019s strange and wrong about Wimbledon 2019s sign, really, is its overall dolorous tone. Subtlety, touch, and finesse are not dead in the power-baseline era. For it is, still, in 2006, very much the power-baseline era: Roger Federer is a first-rate, kick-ass power-baseliner. It 2019s just that that 2019s not all he is. There 2019s also his intelligence, his occult anticipation, his court sense, his ability to read and manipulate opponents, to mix spins and speeds, to misdirect and disguise, to use tactical foresight and peripheral vision and kinesthetic range instead of just rote pace  2014 all this has exposed the limits, and possibilities, of men 2019s tennis as it 2019s now played.  Which sounds very high-flown and nice, of course, but please understand that with this guy it 2019s not high-flown or abstract. Or nice. In the same emphatic, empirical, dominating way that Lendl drove home his own lesson, Roger Federer is showing that the speed and strength of today 2019s pro game are merely its skeleton, not its flesh. He has, figuratively and literally, re-embodied men 2019s tennis, and for the first time in years the game 2019s future is unpredictable. You should have seen, on the grounds 2019 outside courts, the variegated ballet that was this year 2019s Junior Wimbledon. Drop volleys and mixed spins, off-speed serves, gambits planned three shots ahead  2014 all as well as the standard-issue grunts and booming balls. Whether anything like a nascent Federer was here among these juniors can 2019t be known, of course. Genius is not replicable. Inspiration, though, is contagious, and multiform  2014 and even just to see, close up, power and aggression made vulnerable to beauty is to feel inspired and (in a fleeting, mortal way) reconciled.

            "input": "text:In 1939, the producers of Gone with the Wind had to fight for the inclusion of Rhett Butler 2019s famous line,  201cFrankly my dear, I don 2019t give a damn. 201d And it 2019s been downhill ever since.  One survey found almost 90% of Britons swear (an average of 14 times a day) and barely any of them think it 2019s offensive  Swearing is everywhere and we 2019re all to blame. One survey found that almost 90% of Britons swear (an average of 14 times a day) and barely any of them think it 2019s offensive.  So if everyone 2019s doing it and nobody cares, should we just stop clutching our pearls and accept salty language at work? In truth, many of us do it anyway. And while the professional world disapproves (or at least acts like it does), some researchers think swearing has certain advantages.  Does swearing make you look stupid and unprofessional?  It can make you feel better, but it doesn 2019t earn you respect - James O 2019Connor  Many people think employees should take the high road. A CareerBuilder survey found that 81% of employers think profanity is unprofessional. And most think it shows immaturity, a lack of control and even makes the employee appear less intelligent.   201cYou might ask what harm does it do, but what good does it do? It can make you feel better, but it doesn 2019t earn you respect, reflect strong character, solve disagreements, exhibit intelligence, or get you promoted, 201d says James O 2019Connor, the author of Cuss Control, a book on how to curb cursing.  Then again, there are plenty of people at the top of the pecking order who swear. It 2019s not just celebrity chefs like Gordon Ramsay or fictitious characters like the industrial-strength foul mouth Malcolm Tucker from The Thick of It.  Executives like Yahoo 2019s former CEO Carol Bartz and T-Mobile 2019s current CEO John Legere have both happily and publicly dropped the f-bomb. Even US President Barack Obama famously said he was trying to figure out  201cwhose ass to kick 201d after the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.  Clearly, swearing hasn 2019t stopped every potty-mouth 2019s career progress. One study even shows that  201cjudicious 201d use of swearing can make you more persuasive. Maybe, out of the right mouth, it 2019s a leadership tool.  Nobody 2019s suggesting that swearing is a substitute for being good at your job. But can it help? Some research suggests it might, in a roundabout sort of way.  In a 2007 study, a researcher went on an undercover mission, as a worker at a British mail-order warehouse. He was initially excluded from the social group in the office, but things changed after he swore at another employee. It was a sort of initiation rite that cemented a bond with the rest of the group.  Swearing like a sailor isn 2019t just a blue-collar hobby  The co-author of the study, Yehuda Baruch, who 2019s now a professor at the University of Southampton Business School, says that swearing like a sailor isn 2019t just a blue-collar hobby.   201cWe are all human beings, and even if you 2019re a distinguished lawyer, you might swear, 201d according to Baruch.  But how does that help? Well, carpet bombing your workplace with profanity won 2019t get you a promotion, but fitting in at the workplace helps.   201cI 2019m not saying this a major criteria for promotion, but one criteria for promotion is the ability to connect with people. In certain contexts, swearing is a way to connect, 201d he says.  Two sides of the coin  But this might also suggest a broader problem with swearing. If it serves to consolidate the bonds in one group, is it to the exclusion of others? And if so, could it play a part in making the workplace more hostile?   201cSwearing usually expresses anger or a negative attitude that can be contagious, creating a less pleasant working environment, 201d James O 2019Connor says.  And really, its effect on the working environment is where it becomes a genuine issue.   201cContext is everything, 201d according to Roland Hassall, who 2019s a Sydney-based workplace lawyer at Sparke Helmore. His firm deals with a case a week where swearing is a factor. But it 2019s almost never the only factor, or even the main one.  Most workplaces today aren 2019t concerned about offending tender ears. They 2019re interested in creating a harmonious and productive working environment. Employment cases that involve swearing are more often about something more serious, like bullying or harassment.  Society is a lot more permissive now than say in the 1960s in terms of what you can say   201cSociety is a lot more permissive now than say in the 1960s in terms of what you can say, 201d Hassall says.  But there is a clear exception to this rule. There 2019s far less tolerance for sexist and racist language, which can quickly cross the legal line into sexual harassment or discrimination.   201cMost of the tribunals or commissions would have no hesitation upholding disciplinary action in cases like that, 201d he says.  But if sexist and racist language is rightfully a no-go zone, there are other well-worn rules for avoiding trouble. If in doubt, don 2019t swear in front of children, microphones, customers, patients or interview panels. And swearing at an actual human is riskier than swearing at the paper jam in the printer.  When, where and how you swear matters just as much as which linguistic grenade you toss  When, where and how you swear matters just as much as which linguistic grenade you toss. But figuring out what 2019s acceptable and what 2019s off-limits is subjective and blurry, and at times pretty weird.  At the extreme end of the spectrum, swearing is flat out illegal in some countries. Recently, rapper 50 Cent was arrested and fined for using profanity during one of his shows in St Kitts. In the United Arab Emirates, there are more serious penalties, even for swearing over a messaging app.  Figuring out what 2019s acceptable in other cultures can be very tricky. While religion-based swearing has lost its impact in many western countries, blasphemy laws are still enforced in the Middle East. In some Asian cultures, a poorly-placed swear word might result in a loss of face, which could sour the relationship. Even within the US, there are some pretty dramatic differences in what people find offensive. In short, it 2019s probably best to err on the side of caution if you don 2019t know the rules.  One Sydney-based journalist, who asked to remain anonymous, broke most of the rules and came out better off. She says firing off nuclear-grade expletives at her boss actually earned his respect.  She was covering a story on a hot summer day, and asked the chief of staff to send a bottle of water and a sandwich when he changed over the camera crew. Neither the water nor the sandwich materialised and she fainted in a press conference.  Later, she called him and gave him both barrels, loudly calling him a name most wouldn 2019t use on their worst enemies.   201cI 2019m really glad I did it, and I think the swear words expressed exactly how angry and upset I was. It may not have been  2018professional 2019 but I think it got me a lot more professional respect, 201d she says.   201cHe later told me he had a lot more respect for me after this incident, and since then has genuinely checked with me to make sure I 2019m OK (not in a patronising way either  2013 I think it just made him remember I wasn 2019t a robot). 201d  But again, context is everything. She had the moral high ground in the dispute. She works in an office where swearing is common. Perhaps in another workplace, it would have ended very differently.

            "input": "text:WASHINGTON, June 7 (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan strongly disavowed Donald Trump's allegations of bias against a Hispanic judge, calling such remarks the  textbook definition of a racist comment,  even as he reiterated his support for Trump's White House bid.  Ryan, speaking at an event to unveil U.S. House Republicans' policy proposals, said the comments by the Republican Party's presumptive presidential nominee were unacceptable and indefensible.  SEE ALSO: Former GOP figure: Donald Trump is 'clearly' a racist   I regret those comments that he made. Claiming a person can't do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of a racist comment. I think that should be absolutely disavowed,  Ryan told reporters.  Nonetheless, Ryan said that a Trump presidency would be preferable to a White House occupied by Democrat Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee.  Ryan, the country's highest-ranking elected Republican, just last week endorsed Trump's presidential bid after withholding support for weeks in part because of Trump's past controversial statements about Mexicans and Muslims.  Since then, Trump has become embroiled in a new controversy - over his comments last week about Mexican-American U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel.  The real estate developer refused on Monday to back down on his comments suggesting that Curiel, who is overseeing fraud lawsuits against Trump University, is biased against him because of his heritage and Trump's campaign statements on preventing illegal immigration from Mexico.

The controversy has taken center stage in the presidential campaigns. It overshadowed Ryan's attempt to showcase on Tuesday a new welfare reform plan that Republicans hope to run on through the Nov. 8 election and turn into legislation next year if they maintain control of the Senate and House of Representatives.  Other Republican lawmakers also piled on pressure on Trump to stop making incendiary remarks and to focus more on issues that can attract a broader electorate in the general election.  Ryan's counterpart in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, said on Tuesday that Trump should avoid such comments, saying,  The less said about all that the better.   On Sunday, McConnell, interviewed on NBC's  Meet the Press,  attacked Trump's remarks about Curiel but stopped short of calling them racist.   We are trying to get in line, but he keeps taking the subject away from unifying the party, which he needs to be doing right now by reaching out and bringing people with whom he competed, and talking about the issues the American people care about,  the Senate majority leader told Fox Business Network in an interview on Tuesday.  Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, who has been supportive of Trump and has been mentioned as a possible vice presidential candidate, took to MSNBC on Tuesday to plead for Trump to switch gears and focus on defeating Clinton in the five months until the election.   It's up to him now to pivot. I want to encourage that,  Corker said.  He has time  I will continue to encourage him until it's too late.   Clinton has secured enough delegates to win the Democratic presidential nomination, according to U.S. media outlets. But her campaign urged supporters to get to the polls on Tuesday in a swath of late primaries to avoid a loss to Bernie Sanders in California as she seeks to unite Democrats ahead of the November match-up with Trump.

A study from the University of Auckland has found by 2085 almost 90 per cent of the large cities in the Northern Hemisphere will be so affected by climate change, the temperature and humidity will be too high to safely run a marathon in summer.  But epidemiology and biostatistics professor Alistair Woodward, who co-authored the study, says where to host the Olympics would only be the start of the problem for outdoor exercise in the future.   Increasing restrictions on when, where, and how the Games can be held owing to extreme heat are a sign of a much bigger problem,  he said.   If the world's most elite athletes need to be protected from climate change, what about the rest of us?   The study found only three cities in North America, two in Asia and none in Africa would be considered  low-risk  for outdoor exercise in the future.   Projections to early next century suggest the last cities with low-risk summer conditions will be Belfast, Dublin, Edinburgh and Glasgow,  Prof Woodward said.  The study, published on Friday in The Lancet, is a collaboration with the Nelson Marlborough Institute of Technology and universities in Cyprus and California.  Prof Woodward said some parts of the world already had temperatures too high to do strenuous exercise outdoors - as measured by a combination of temperature, humidity, heat radiation, and wind - and climate change would mean more regions would get worse for more of the year.   The world beyond 2050 poses increasingly difficult challenges, not only because of the inherent uncertainties in long-term predictions, but because the extent and speed of change might exceed society's ability to adapt,  he said.

Mr. Nemets took up pipe smoking 18 months ago after strolling into a pipe and tobacco store near the Mount Pleasant campus with a friend. Mr. Nemets can't smoke in his dorm room but has networked with other youthful smokers on Facebook in the Collegiate Gentlemen's Pipe Smoking League.

Mr. Vig started smoking a pipe as an undergrad at Carleton College 53 years ago.  Back then, everyone smoked a pipe,  Mr. Vig says. His group, which meets monthly in Manhattan, has seen a definite increase in college students and young professionals, he says.  No one tracks how many young men and women are pipe smokers. But sales of pipe tobacco are rising again after years of decline, and many think young smokers are the reason. U.S. sales of pipe tobacco plummeted to 4.9 million pounds in 2006, from 52 million pounds in 1970, says Norman Sharp, president of the Cigar Association of America. Sales climbed to 5.3 million pounds in 2008. Pipe tobacco and smokeless tobacco sales are on the rise, offsetting over a decade of decreases in cigarette sales.  Pipe-smoking groups on social-networking sites like Facebook and MySpace have attracted thousands of members. Questions in the forums include: A bent or straight pipe? Does anyone have a favorite perique Louisiana tobacco blend? What is the consensus on corncob pipes?  Sykes Wilford,28, burned his tongue when he first started smoking a pipe as a freshman at Vanderbilt University, in Nashville, Tenn. He now walks new smokers through the first puffs in his own store in Little River, S.C., to ensure they don't meet the same fate. Although he mostly carries traditional pipes, he's trying to bring a modern edge to the ancient habit.  For me to have an iPhone in one hand and a pipe in the other is not unusual,  he says.  To appeal to his own demographic, Mr. Wilford hired another young pipe smoker, Adam Davidson, 27. The two created a Web site where they post photos of their inventory. They tout the thriftiness of smoking a pipe in newsletters. The two contend that smoking a pipe, in the long run, is cheaper than smoking cigarettes. That has been a great selling point with the cash-strapped, ramen-noodle-eating crowd, the men say.  Money played a role when Ed Rice picked up his first pipe. The 21-year-old junior at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign began puffing two years ago.  We bought the cheaper-end ones,  he says. His pipe cost around $30, but he estimates he spends much less than cigarette smokers do on their tobacco habits -- less than $10 a week.  Tom Moran, owner of the 115-year-old Rich's Cigar Store in Portland, Ore., noticed a recent uptick in sales of corncob pipes, which retail for $4 to $7 in his store, and  starter  brier pipes that sell for as much as $22.95. Although the youngsters have less cash than some of his older clientele, he welcomes the business.  You hate to watch your customers die off,  Mr. Moran says.  Bill Shindler, the pipe specialist who works the store floor of Rich's, estimates that 60% of the younger pipe smokers who come in once stay with it.  They're looking for an alternative to cigarette smoking.   Mr. Shindler also says that smoking trends reflect the changing economy. His store did a booming business in expensive cigars during the bull market of the nineties.   Cigars said, 'I've made it,'   Mr. Shindler says.  It was a form of reward for yourself. When Wall Street crashed, people backed off from that.  Pipe smoking, he says, has a more calming effect.  It's a comfortable aroma. It reminds you of grandpa. People are looking for that kind of comfort.   Joanna Murakami, a statistics graduate student at University of California at Riverside, took up pipe smoking at 19 because  it looked like the coolest thing ever.  The 24-year-old lights up about once a week.  Her reaction to onlookers, surprised at the sight of a young woman with a pipe?  I don't care,  she says.  Public-health experts, of course, don't think pipe smoking is at all cool. It's smoking, and it's dangerous, they say.   The end result would be they'll have fewer teeth,  says Jasim M. Albandar, a professor of periodontology at Temple University, in Philadelphia. Dr. Albandar headed up a study published in December 2000 that focused on the dental impacts of pipe and cigar smoking. He found that pipe smokers had severe plaque, inflamed gums and higher risks of periodontal disease, even though they tend to smoke less often than cigarette smokers do.   It's a misconception that pipe smoking is a healthy alternative,  says Thomas J. Glynn, director, cancer science and trends, for the American Cancer Society. Dr. Glynn says that pipe smoking has been associated with oral cancers and lesions of the lip, tongue and gums which can cause severe facial disfiguration.  Youthful pipe smokers seem to think the habit is less harmful than smoking cigarettes because the smoke isn't inhaled.  I recognize that it can be hazardous in the extreme,  Ms. Murakami says, but  it seems healthier than smoking a cigarette. It helps me calm down, and it helps me think.   Others like that it's still unconventional in style.  There's something culturally attractive about smoking a pipe,  Mr. Wilford says.  There may be some nostalgia there, too.   There will be some serious puffing and pondering at slow-smoking competitions today and this weekend to commemorate this year's International Pipe-Smoking Day.  Skip Elliott, owner of the Briary in Homewood, Ala., will hold a slow-smoking competition on Saturday and expects some of his more youthful regulars to attend. He estimates that a quarter of his business comes from people under 30.  They come in groups,  Mr. Elliott says.  He says that smokers pile in from the nearby universities, text each other,  and soon there's a line out the door.   Young smokers have been swapping emails, sending Facebook messages and Googling for information about techniques and strategies for smoking competitions. Many are competing for the first time.  But, as Mr. Nemets learned at his first competition in October, young lungs aren't necessarily a ticket to earning a tobacco trophy.   I competed against a 96-year-old,  Mr. Nemets says.  I got my butt kicked.  Mr. Nemets's time was 26 minutes. The 96-year-old kept his pipe lit for more than two hours, Mr. Nemets says.   There's a technique,  Mr. Nemets says.  And I've still gotta learn it.   Write to Mary Pilon at mary.pilon@wsj.com Summary: An unlikely set of smokers is taking to the pipe -- people in their 20s.",

It's up to Attorney-General George Brandis to explain how the government will win over Labor with changes to a plebiscite, he says.  Despite earlier hinting a deal could be in sight and reeling off a wishlist, Mr Dreyfus firmed up his stance on Friday afternoon.   At the moment, it does not appear to me that the right wing of the Liberal Party is prepared to compromise on anything,  he told reporters in Melbourne.  The pair will meet in Brisbane on Monday, as the coalition attempts to break a political deadlock on a national vote.  Mr Dreyfus doesn't characterise the meeting as an attempt to reach a compromise.  However, he earlier listed changes that could make the plebiscite more palatable for the opposition, a different tune to that of Labor leader Bill Shorten who stuck to his fierce opposition on Friday.  Among them were scrapping $15 million in public funding for the  yes  and  no  campaigns and making the vote automatically trigger a new law should the nation vote yes.  But Mr Dreyfus later clarified he  in no sense  knew what Senator Brandis was going to say at the requested meeting.   I'm not going into this meeting with a list of conditions,  he said.  The clarification came after Mr Shorten said the only compromise he was considering was the prime minister allowing MPs a free vote on same-sex marriage legislation in parliament.  Labor caucus is yet to formally decide its position on a plebiscite but Mr Shorten is expected to recommend its opposition.   The whole Labor team have grave reservations about the shocking waste of money that this plebiscite is (and) the unnecessary division it causes in our community,  Mr Shorten told reporters in Sydney on Friday.   Let's be clear: we haven't heard so far any good argument to support this plebiscite and I'm still waiting for the first one.   Mr Dreyfus earlier tried to convince the Freedom for Faith conference in Melbourne the fear of same-sex marriage encroaching on religious freedom was unfounded.   The two are not related,  he told delegates.   It is not right for us to deny equal rights to another person because they do not match with what our idea of love should be.   'Love thy neighbour' does not come with conditions.   He used libertarian senator David Leyonhjelm's support for same-sex marriage to prove it would not be an encroachment of the state on religious belief systems.  The world and organised religion would not end when same-sex marriage became reality, as it had not in the United States, Ireland or New Zealand, he said.   Marriage equality will happen in Australia,  Mr Dreyfus said.   It is not a question of if, but when and how.  Summary: Attorney-General George Brandis will meet his opposition counterpart on Monday to discuss a way around the deadlock over a same-sex marriage plebiscite.",

Meanwhile, a website with suspected ties to the government of Russia leaked stolen information about the travel itinerary of Vice President Joe Biden and First Lady Michelle Obama, including a scanned image of her passport.  The Yahoo breach puts at risk passwords, e-mail address, and phone numbers for millions of users. Yahoo urged consumers to be wary of suspicious e-mails.  The two episodes are the latest sign that the world 2019s best computer security engineers seem incapable of securing the nation 2019s critical computer networks against spies and criminals.  Federal law enforcement officials are looking into both cyber attacks.  Last month, US officials said Russian hackers attacked voter registration computers in Illinois and Arizona, and stole personal information on as many as 200,000 Illinois voters. In July, thousands of e-mails stolen from the Democratic National Committee were made public; again, US intelligence officials blamed Russia. In June 2015, the Office of Personnel Management said criminals believed to be working on behalf of China had stolen the records of 21.5 million current or former US government employees.   201cYou cannot assume that anything electronic is safe, that anything digital is safe, 201d said Jeff Pollard, a digital security analyst for Cambridge-based Forrester Research.  The Yahoo saga began in August, when the website Motherboard reported that a hacker known as  201cPeace 201d was attempting to sell copies of a file containing 200 million stolen Yahoo user accounts for about $1,900. Yahoo investigated and concluded there was no truth to the claim. But during the investigation, Yahoo 2019s researchers uncovered a much worse data breach that had gone undetected for two years.  Yahoo said it believes the hack was carried out by  201ca state-sponsored actor 201d  2014 in other words, an unidentified foreign government. The stolen data are believed to include names, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, and encrypted passwords.  Yahoo said the thieves did not gain access to computers containing unprotected passwords, payment card data, or bank account information. Yahoo urged its users to check their accounts for signs of suspicious activity and to change their passwords and security questions immediately.  Users of Yahoo Mail were also told to beware of suspicious e-mail messages. These could be fraudulent  201cphishing 201d messages sent to people whose addresses have been stolen, seeking to get further data.   2018 2018We take these types of breaches very seriously and will determine how this occurred and who is responsible, 2019 2019 the FBI said in a statement.  Yahoo, founded in 1994, was an early star of the dot-com boom, but its Internet search business was eclipsed by Google 2019s and it struggled to compete for advertisers. Its finances steadily weakened, and in July it struck a deal to be acquired by Verizon Communications Inc. for $4.83 billion. Thursday 2019s disclosure could complicate the deal, as Verizon said it learned of the hack  201cwithin the last two days. 201d  Still, the company is one of the world 2019s leading online destinations for news and information, and its e-mail service is used by hundreds of millions of people. Its websites, which include Yahoo News and Tumblr, attract about a billion users per month worldwide. In the United States alone, the company 2019s various Internet services attract over 200 million users a month, making it the third most popular Internet destination, after Google and Facebook.  The typical Yahoo user might not seem important enough to be targeted by foreign agents. But Stuart Madnick, professor of information technologies at the MIT Sloan School of Management, said the records of a seemingly insignificant person could someday prove useful.  201cIt 2019s stockpiling weapons, 201d Madnick said.  201cAt some point in the future you might be somebody important. 201d  Besides, he said, a successful raid on Yahoo would teach lessons that could be used in attacks on other targets.  201cIf it does work, 201d he said,  201cI 2019m going to do it to Microsoft next, I 2019m going to do it to Google next. 201d  Bruce Schneier, a fellow at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University, said the Yahoo breach was very serious because so many Internet users routinely store sensitive data on Internet-based systems  2014 not on the hard drives in their desktop PCs, for example.  201cWe no longer keep our stuff on our computers, 201d he said.  201cWe keep our stuff on their computers. 201d  But Schneier, who is also chief technology officer of Resilient, an IBM data security company, said consumers are still better off relying on cloud-based services. These systems, despite their flaws, are still more secure than the average home computer.  201cFor most people, 201d he said,  201cthese companies do a much better job of protecting their data then they do. 201d  The stolen information about Michelle Obama was part of a batch of e-mails from February 2015 through July 2016 and purportedly hacked from the Gmail account of a White House  201cadvance 201d staffer responsible for the logistics of official trips. The breach included the photo and information page of her passport, including passport number, birth date, and place of birth  2014 most of which is public information.  The White House said it was looking into the breach, as did the attorney general.  NBC News reported the e-mails were sent from the Gmail account of Ian Mellul, a contractor at the White House. They included sensitive information such as the names of Secret Service and White House Military Office personnel who traveled with President Obama to Cuba; a guide to computer security for the president 2019s staff while traveling abroad; and travel schedules for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and her husband, former president Bill Clinton.

            "input": "text:WASHINGTON  2014 on Sept. 10 the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet issued Decree No. 588, which strips me of my nationality, for  201cgravely threatening the essential interests of the state. 201d This measure is just one more addition to the shameful history of the violation of human rights committed by the military junta.  On Tuesday, Orlando Leteller, who was Chilean Foreign Minister in the Government of President Salvador Allende Gossens, was killed in Washington when a bomb exploded in his car. He had been a leader of Chilean political exiles in the United States who opposed the military junta that overthrew President Allende in 1973. He wrote the following article for the Op 2010Ed page of The New York Times, at his own initiative, a few clays before his death.  In the chronicle of Latin American dictatorships, political rights have frequently been denied to critics and opponents. The Chilean junta, not to be outdone as leader in the field of such violations, has made the entire Chilean population a victim through decree that ordered the burning of the country's electoral register in fact, all the citizenship rights of the population have been destroyed.  Today, having exhausted this repressive mechanism they can only resort to the absurdity of pretending that those who oppose their designs are no longer part of the Chilean nation.  Needless to say, this decree violates the intent of the Constitution that applied in Chile before the rule of law was destroyed there on Sept. 11 201e 1973, together with the norms of international law, especially Article 15 of the Declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations. This action has no precedent in our history. Never have governments vested themselves with the authority to confer or take away Chilean nationality at will.  Because of my position as Minister of State and Ambassador [to the United States] of the constitutional Government of Chile, I was incarcerated in the concentration camp on Dawson Island until I was expelled from the country without any formal charges ever being made against me. was not granted any of the basic rights guaranteed by the Constitution or by the laws of my country.  Among other violations, I was deprived of my passport and thus of my status as a Chilean abroad. Many of my fellow countrymen were subjected to the same arbitrary measures.  It would seem, then, that this decree constitutes a complete absurdity. But behind it one sees the logic of a Wall,. tarian mentality, that it projects Itself from within a system based on terror and vengeance. Its purpose is to intimidate those who fight from abroad for the restoration of human rights, freedom and democracy in Chile. It tries to erase a whole sector of Chileans from the history of our country, to eliminate the protagonists of a social and political ideal with deep roots in our history, which has survived persecution and is today the emblem of the struggle against tyranny.  What the junta is fighting is not so much the men who three years ago led a democratic Government but rather the ideas we represent. What they are denying is the nationality of values, such as Chilean democracy, that for 150 years constituted an example for Latin America and for the world.  What they are attempting to destroy are the political parties that channeled the aspirations of the Chilean people, its trade 2010union organizations, and its convivial way of life, based on the free play of ideas and respect for the human being.  Accordingly, to Pinochet none of this has any place within the Chilean nationality, and the fascist ideology that Pinochet professes can be seen in this most delirious expression of his fanaticism.  The patriotic obligation of all Chileans is to 2010contribute to the and of the dictatorship. We do it as members of a nation and as Inheritors of a tradition of freedom to which the Pinochets do not belong.  The things that destroy our nationality are the concentration camps, torture, repression and hunger. That which makes us vulnerable as a nation is the utilization of the armed forces against the Chilean people. it is all this brutal conduct and not the actions of those who want to put an end to it that isolates us today from the community of civilized nations.  The image of Chile will return to what it once was when democracy is re 2010established along with the human rights that have been usurped by the dictators. At that moment no one will be in any doubt about the nationality of the Chileans who are in power today on the contrary, as such they will be made to answer to Chilean tribunals in accordance with the Chilean judicial system for crimes committed against their country.

Just do it in the way that is right for you.  201cYou don 2019t have to do a public Facebook posting, 201d he says.  201cYou can write to 15 of your closest friends and tell them. It doesn 2019t mean tell a million people. It means tell people who can help you. 201d  And don 2019t just tell them you need help.  201cBe very specific about the things you can do and what you are looking for because even your best friend typically has no idea what exactly your job is or what your skill set is or what you want to do, 201d he says.  Don 2019t wait until you need people to connect with them.   201cReach out to people when you don 2019t need them. Build your network when you don 2019t need them. Connect to people when you don 2019t need them, 201d Sreenivasan says.  When you do need them a month or year from now, it 2019s much easier because you 2019ve stayed in touch but not because you were asking for something  It can be as simple as letting someone know you are thinking about them through a text or a quick call or even a comment or a few extra likes on Facebook.  201cThat 2019s all you have to do, and it gives you so much good will, 201d he says. Then, when you do need them a month or year from now, it 2019s much easier because you 2019ve stayed in touch, but not because you were asking for something.  201cThat is what social media allows you to do, 201d he explains.  This can also help you tap into extended networks, which are where you are more likely to find leads or jobs, according to Claudia Jonczyk, associate professor at ESCP Europe business school 2019s London campus. People often make the mistake of assuming job leads and referrals only come from their close networks. But those people  201ctend to have the same type and level of information that you have, 201d Jonczyk says. Instead, it 2019s those  201cmore distant pockets of knowledge, 201d the people who they know who might know of someone or something that could help you in your search.  When deciding what  2014 if any  2014 message to put out there, it 2019s important to  201calways remember that in our digital age, everything we do leaves a permanent footprint, 201d says Tampa, Florida-based Adam Lloyd, president of global executive search firm Webber Kerr Associates. So remain professional in your social media posts.  201cIf your message isn 2019t a sustainable one, don 2019t broadcast it. 201d Always ask yourself first,  201cWhat do I have to gain from this? 201d suggests Lloyd, and,  201cWhat do I have to lose? 201d  In our digital age, everything we do leaves a permanent footprint  While writing a vengeful post about your former employer might feel good in the moment, posting something like that is ill advised, even if you feel you're warning future prospects about a dishonest boss or company culture. It could gain you some social media attention, but  201cfuture potential employers could view your actions poorly and may associate you with high risk and that you burn bridges, 201d Lloyd says.  Lloyd recommends pausing before clicking send.  201cIf you decide to go public, I suggest avoiding immediate, emotional reactions; never taking personal jabs, not leaking proprietary information, letting the facts speak and staying positive, 201d he says. In addition, consider where you are posting it.  201cLinkedIn may not be the appropriate stage for a broadcast intended for Facebook, 201d he says.  It also depends on where you are located, says Jonczyk.  201cHaving been made redundant is more of a taboo in France or Germany than in countries with a more fluid job market with lower barriers of entry, 201d she says. So, it 2019s something else to weigh when deciding what you might or might not share.  If you decide to go public, I suggest avoiding immediate, emotional reactions  The type of job search can also help you decide whether you want to share your news publicly, according to Lisa Rangel, managing director of New York-based ChameleonResumes.com.  201cIf social media and digital communications are a part of the target job, outbound social media activity is smart to do to demonstrate skills, 201d she says. But,  201cif your job search is confidential or sensitive, publicly outing the search may not be best and is a decision to be made on a case-by-case basis. 201d  No matter what type of search you are doing, avoid saying anything disparaging about a prior boss or employer, whether you are online or offline, says Rangel.  201cThere is just never a scenario where this works. 201d Instead,  201cphrase departures as a learning experience. 201d  Avoid saying anything disparaging about a prior boss or employer, whether you are online or offline  And, take a page from Sreenivasan 2019s approach.  201cIn a time where there 2019s such a high premium on authenticity and humility, [he] humanised himself and made himself vulnerable, 201d says Webber Kerr 2019s Lloyd.  201cNot careless, but transparent and real. In addition to exposing an unfavourable situation, [he] goes further to leverage it as a learning and engagement opportunity. 201d  To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, please head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.

A pre-inquest conference in August heard Donna Alexia Cowley-Persch,58, was found by her colleagues in September 2013 after having administered the  rapidly fatal  substance.  Now, the inquest is investigating regulations applied to the drug, which legally must be locked away and monitored when in tablet form but not when in injectable form.  Practice manager of the Ascot Veterinary Clinic Kate Miller told the Coroners Court on Wednesday the site now kept the injectable version in a locked safe after Ms Cowley-Persch's death.  But she said the practice was not required to keep a record book dedicated to the use of the drug and admitted it was possible for an amount of the drug to go missing without anybody noticing.   It would be fair to say that at least a part bottle could go missing from the practice and no one would necessarily blink an eye?  counsel assisting Peter De Waard posed.   It's possible, yes,  she replied.  She said staff didn't necessarily know where the drug was stored but acknowledged the substance  wasn't hidden .  The inquest also heard the deceased dog groomer had handed Ms Miller a letter outlining personal stress in the days before her body was found.  But while the letter detailed her feelings that she was losing  perspective  and needing to muster all her energy to get through the day, Ms Miller said she didn't regard her colleague as suicidal at the time.  Asked by Mr De Waard if the letter, taken as a whole, was essentially Ms Cowley-Persch  crying out for help , Ms Miller replied:  In hindsight, yes .

There should have been no surprise at the vehemence of the hard 2010hat workers who  201cdefended Old Glory 201d by beating student antiwar demonstrators. The recent Federal law imposing a $1,000 fine and or a year in jail for those who  201cdesecrate 201d a flag which may have cost only a few dollars reflects a widespread scale of values.  Emotions always run high when an emblem epitomizing a group of people or a way of life seems threatened. In the 1870's France refused to accept the restoration of the monarchy be cause Charles V, the king 2010to 2010be, in sisted on replacing the Tricolor with the old Bourbon banner.  In our own country the last few years have borne witness to hundreds of  201cflag incidents. 201d A teacher in Flori da lost his job for refusing to lead the Pledge of Allegiance. In Illinois students were charged with flag des ecration when they displayed the  201cecology flag. 201d  What can be clone to end our na tional dispute over symbols? Is there hope for agreement in this country about the meaning and proper use of the flag? Emotional involvement often tends to distort our perception, but experience makes certain facts clear.  The flag is a symbol. An attack on It will not end a bad war, overturn an unjust ruling, alter a prejudiced at titude. Since a majority holds the flag to be above politics, to attack it is politically counterproductive. Flag burning may be offensive, but protect ing the flag as a physical object does nothing to protect the principles that flag represents.  Symbols are mutable. Over time our flag has stood for war as well as peace, slavery as well as freedom, authoritarian rule as well as democ racy, civil strife as well as harmony. Yet its meaning today and in the fu ture depends entirely on us, not on the past.  Symbols are respected when respect able, reviled when disrespectable. No law, fine or jail term will coerce a man into honoring a  2018flag he believes to have been dishonored by the nation it stands for.  Respect for a flag (or other symbol) is also correlated with its expression of the real aspirations and beliefs of a people. Men who feel themselves excluded from the symbolism of flag, or limited in their use of it, will be tempted to institute alternate badges of legitimacy.  These observations suggest a pro gram which might help us find again the high regard in which the Star Spangled Banncr has traditionally been held. First, we must repeal all flag 2010desecration laws if the courts do not have the wisdom to declare them unconstitutional. They are fundamen tally contrary to First Amendment civil liberties. Such laws attempt to coerce universal conformity with majority canons of taste, thereby negating the essential meaning of the flag.  Once recognized as a set of volun tary guidelines, our flag etiquette code must be revitalized. Much improper flag usage could be eliminated quite simply if the rules for flag display, written 50 years ago, were brought up to date.  Students, for example, would re spond more readily to a new version of the flag pledge proclaiming:  201cI salute the flag of the United States of America by committing myself to the principle that the nation for which it stands shall ever be indivisible and dedicated to liberty and justice for all. 201d  We should also consider readopting the original Stars and Stripes. This 13 2010star flag is esthetically superior to the 50 2010star model, as well as easier and less expensive to make. But more importantly, a ring of stars better symbolizes our harmony in diversity. Restoring this as our official flag would herald the continued commit ment of Americans from all parts of the political spectrum to our revolu tionary heritage.  The 13 2010star ring of unity design would be a flag for all Americans Citizens from the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the territories would no longer be excluded from the flag. Nor would those who feel a greater loyalty to race, religion, class, or local community than to a particular state.  Ultimately, attitudes toward Old Glory both at home and abroad would be determined by the policies and, leadership of the nation. But the pro gram outlined here could shift cur rent debate away from the flag to substantive issues, while reaffirming the principles the flag was originally adopted to represent.

But Keitel's co-star Tom Cruise is hanging in there.  Cruise admits that  it can be grueling  trying to please the perfectionist, airplane-hating director of  Dr. Strangelove  and  A Clockwork Orange.    He rehearses, we work on the scene, he rewrites, we work on the scene, then he rewrites again,  Cruise told us recently. But the  Jerry Maguire  star doesn't have a problem with the regimen on the hush-hush project now shooting in England.   As an actor, you have to support the director. It's his vision.   Cruise did have some apprehension about Kubrick's psychological thriller, in which the actor and his real-life wife, Nicole Kidman, play out all manner of sexual fantasies.   I wondered, `Is he going to let me work on the character give me room?' But he does all of that. He knows that we are working on very complex scenes and he builds in time to work on them.   Cruise discounted talk that Kubrick has made him dress up in women's clothing.   I've read a lot of stuff. No one's gotten it right. They're reaching.   It is a very, very challenging role. But [Kubrick] doesn't make any great demands on me. He's very sweet, and really patient. He's got a wonderful sense of humor. We sit around and laugh. But we're working our a off. ... He's one of the most intelligent people I've ever met.   Kidman has said that when  people see the film, they're going to have a field day analyzing our relationship.  Is the kinky project putting any stress on th e couple?  Cruise called their movie mind games  exciting.    Making movies is stressful. It's physically and emotionally demanding. Nic and I are very good to each other when we're doing it.  Judging by their ravenous public nuzzling at Vanity Fair's Oscar party, they're holding up fine.  We talked with Cruise before word came that Keitel had been replaced by Sydney Pollack on the film. (Keitel's publicist told New York magazine that he left simply because he had another movie commitment.) But Cruise observed that you never know who'll be left the next morning on the set when Kubrick sets about trimming his budget:  We'll have a crew of 35 people and I'll say, `What happened to Tony?' I'm told, `He got cut loose.'    RANGERS RUB SPIKE THE WRONG WAY  Ever wonder why rabid Knicks fan Spike Lee isn't rinkside at Ranger games? The director writes in  The Best Seat in the House  (Crown) that he gave hockey the cold shoulder after former Ranger coach Emile Francis rubbed his head as a boy.   It was an insulting tradition among some people, rubbing a pickaninny's head for luck,  writes Lee.  Never been a Ranger fan since that incident.   Lee interviews fans and players in the book, including former Sen. Bill Bradley, who reveals that he refused all offers of commercial endorsements when he played for the Knicks.  I failed badly my first year.... I was too slow to play guard,  Bradley told Lee.  At the same time, I was receiving these rather sizable offers. The Dairy Association wanted me to be a spokesperson for milk. Olivetti wanted me to be its national spokesperson. I felt these things were coming to me not because I was the best player on the team, which I wasn't, but because I was white. So I just decided, I'm not going to do it, and I never did.   Rita Jenrette, who made headlines when she revealed she had sex with her then-husband, Congressman John Jenrette, on the Capitol steps, claims she's being stalked by an ex-boyfriend who allegedly bilked her of her savings.  Now a Manhattan real estate broker, Jenrette says her ex-lover  has harassed me and terrorized me for two years.... I obviously have bad judgment in men.   The boyfriend wouldn't comment on Jenrette's charges. Meanwhile, Jenrette, who once posed for Playboy, confesses that she recently had her breast implants removed.  I was always very tired,  she explained.  It was chronic fatigue from an allergic response to seeping silicone. But don't worry, I'm still a size D.   Fred and Kim Goldman, Robert De Niro, Christopher Reeve, Mira Sorvino, Yaphet Kotto and Ron Silver are among those being courted by major media to sit at their tables at the April 26 White House Correspondents dinner.

This was something done last year,  said Terry Hunt, White House Correspondents Association president.  We are accommodating anyone who requests a special meal.  ...  Yonkers is doubling for Dublin in  Nora,  the movie that Christopher Walken is making with director Michael Almereyda. Walken told us at the Patroon party for  Paradise Road  that he loved Kevin Spacey's imitation of him at the Oscars:  I laughed my head off.  ...

Band members will repair to Chaos, the cushy Watts St. lounge, for an afterparty to benefit the AIDS charity LIFEbeat ...

It was Teddy Roosevelt who was very much in the news today. President Obama gave a speech in Kansas trying to emulate Roosevelt 2019s populism and nationalism 100 years after Roosevelt left the Republican Party to run for president in 1912 as a Progressive. Read more about Obama 2019s speech here.  Gingrich was on the other side of Teddy Roosevelt in history during a spirited radio interview with conservative Glenn Beck today. Gingrich was played a 2003 quote of himself in which he endorsed the idea of a mandate that Americans buy health insurance because a previous Republican, Teddy Roosevelt, who went on to become founder of the Progressive Party, endorsed it.  But it 2019s actually Franklin D. Roosevelt, who enlarged the government more than any other president, that Gingrich most admires.  Gingrich reached the heights of Washington power in 1995 when he became speaker of the House, the first Republican to hold the position in 40 years. In a speech to the House of Representatives, he outlined the need for spending cuts to balance the budget, which he thought should exempt Social Security. But he said Washington should not be afraid of cuts elsewhere. And to make that point he invoked F.D.R..   201cBut let me say about everything else, whether it is Medicare, or it is agricultural subsidies, or it is defense or anything that I think the greatest Democratic president of the 20th century, and in my judgment the greatest president of the 20th century, said it right. On March 4,1933, he stood in braces as a man who had polio at a time when nobody who had that kind of disability could be anything in public life. He was president of the United States, and he stood in front of this Capitol on a rainy March day and he said, `We have nothing to fear but fear itself.` 201d  Elsewhere in that speech, Gingrich gave praise to Franklin Roosevelt for the style of his leadership, not his policies.   201cThe fact is that it was Franklin Delano Roosevelt who gave hope to a nation that was in distress and could have slid into dictatorship. Every Republican has much to learn from studying what the Democrats did right, 201d Gingrich told the House of Representatives in 1995.  Listen to Gingrich 2019s 1995 speech here.  Gingrich 2019s view of FDR 2019s being the greatest 20th century president has not changed in the intervening years. Asked by Jake Tapper last month who the fifth president n Mt. Rushmore should be, Gingrich said he 2019d  201cgo for five and six: F.D.R. and Reagan. 201d Read Tapper 2019s Interview with Gingrich.  On the radio, Gingrich was taking fire from conservative Glenn Beck for endorsing Teddy Roosevelt 2019s view on health reform.   201cI were going to characterize my  2013 on health where I come from, I 2019m a Theodore Roosevelt Republican and I believe government can lean in the regulatory leaning is okay, 201d he said in 2003.  It 2019s a view some conservatives find distressing. Beck told Gingrich that the idea of government regulation  201dscares the crap out of me. 201d  Gingrich sought to distinguish between early Roosevelt, the Republican president, and later Roosevelt, the progressive.   201cWell, that depends on which phase of Roosevelt you 2019re talking about. The 1912, he 2019s become a big government, centralized power advocate running an a third party candidate, 201d Gingrich said.

            "input": "text:WASHINGTON, Sept. 27 - An Army captain who reported new allegations of detainee abuse in Iraq said Tuesday that Army investigators seemed more concerned about tracking down young soldiers who reported misconduct than in following up the accusations and investigating whether higher-ranking officers knew of the abuses.  The officer, Capt. Ian Fishback, said investigators from the Criminal Investigation Command and the 18th Airborne Corps inspector general had pressed him to divulge the names of two sergeants from his former battalion who also gave accounts of abuse, which were made public in a report last Friday by the group Human Rights Watch.  Captain Fishback, speaking publicly on the matter for first time, said the investigators who have questioned him in the past 10 days seemed to be less interested in individuals he identified in his chain of command who allegedly committed the abuses.   I'm convinced this is going in a direction that's not consistent with why we came forward,  Captain Fishback said in a telephone interview from Fort Bragg, N.C., where he is going through Army Special Forces training.  We came forward because of the larger issue that prisoner abuse is systemic in the Army. I'm concerned this will take a new twist, and they'll try to scapegoat some of the younger soldiers. This is a leadership problem.   In separate statements to the human rights organization, Captain Fishback and the two sergeants described abuses by soldiers in the 82nd Airborne Division, including beatings of Iraqi prisoners, exposing them to extremes of hot and cold, stacking prisoners in human pyramids, and depriving them of sleep at Camp Mercury, a forward operating base near Falluja. The abuses reportedly took place between September 2003 and April 2004, before and during the abuses at the Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad.  After fruitlessly trying for 17 months to get his superiors to take action on his complaints, Captain Fishback said, he finally took his concerns this month to aides to two senior Republicans on the Senate Armed Services Committee, John W. Warner of Virginia, the committee chairman, and John McCain of Arizona. When the Army learned he was talking to Senate aides, Captain Fishback said that Army investigators suddenly intensified their interest in his complaints.  Senior Pentagon and Army officials said Tuesday that the new allegations, which focus on the division's First Battalion, 504th Parachute Infantry, were being pursued vigorously.  All I know is that the Army is taking it seriously,  Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said at a Pentagon news conference.  To the extent somebody's done something that they shouldn't have done, they'll be punished for it.   Col. Joseph Curtin, an Army spokesman, added:  But it will take time, given the period of time that's elapsed since when these allegations took place.   Captain Fishback,26, a West Point graduate from Michigan and son of a Vietnam War veteran, said he was troubled by the Army's response to his concerns, starting in the spring of 2004 after the abuses at Abu Ghraib became known, about the treatment of detainees that he believed violated the Geneva Conventions.  In the months before, Captain Fishback said he had seen at least one interrogation where prisoners were being abused and was told about other ill treatment of detainees by his sergeants. But he said his commanders left the impression that the United States did not have to follow the Geneva Conventions when dealing with prisoners in Iraq, so he did not report the incidents.  That changed, he said, after he heard Mr. Rumsfeld testify to Congress after the Abu Ghraib abuses became public that the Conventions did apply in Iraq. But when he took his complaints to his immediate superiors, Captain Fishback said his company commander cautioned him to  remember the honor of the unit is at stake.  He said his battalion commander expressed no particular alarm.  As he moved up his chain of command, he said no one could give him clear guidance on how the Geneva Conventions applied in Iraq.   We did not set the conditions for our soldiers to succeed,  said Captain Fishback, who has served combat tours in Afghanistan and Iraq.  We failed to set clear standards, communicate those standards and enforce those standards. For us to get to that point now, however, we have to come to grips with whether it's acceptable to use coercion to obtain information from detainees.   By this summer, Captain Fishback had met with Human Rights Watch researchers several times. He gave the organization the names of other members of his unit who could support his allegations.  Captain Fishback said that when his command learned about 10 days ago that he was preparing to speak to Senate aides about his concerns, they directed him to talk to criminal investigators, which he said he did for 90 minutes on Sept. 19. But when he refused to divulge the sergeants' names, he said, investigators told him there wasn't much they could do immediately.  But last Thursday, a day after Human Rights Watch notified the 82nd Airborne that it would be releasing a copy of its report outlining the allegations, Captain Fishback said he was summoned back to Fort Bragg from field training for six hours of questioning by investigators.  The report was made public last Friday, and Captain Fishback said investigators had questioned him for about an hour on Monday and again on Tuesday.  They're asking the same questions over and over again,  he said.  They want the names of the sergeants, and they keep asking about my relationship with Human Rights Watch.   Captain Fishback said he has refused to disclose the names of the two sergeants - one who has left the Army and another who has been reassigned - because he promised not to disclose their identities if they came forward. But he said his command told him Tuesday that he could face criminal prosecution if disobeyed its  lawful order  to disclose.  Captain Fishback said he had no regrets about coming forward, adding,  It's the right thing to do.  Summary: An Army captain said the investigation appeared to be focusing on those bringing the allegations, and not on the officers who may have shared responsibility.",

I love Ron Paul,  Clarkson tweeted.  I liked him a lot during the last republican nomination and no one gave him a chance. If he wins the nomination for the Republican party in 2012 he's got my vote. Too bad he probably won't.   The pop idol's Twitter followers blasted Clarkson for backing the Libertarian-leaning Texan, who finds himself on the defensive amid revelations that he published a series of racist and homophobic newsletters under his name in the 1980s and 1990s.   I have never heard that Ron Paul is a racist or a homophobe,  tweeted Clarkson, who said she backs Paul because he believes in less government.  Clarkson, who has previously addressed rumors of her own sexuality, later apologized if her endorsement offended anyone.  I do not support racism,  she tweeted.  I support gay rights, straight rights, women's rights, men's rights, white black purple orange rights.   Paul, who would return America to the gold standard, bring home U.S. troops from overseas, and defund the federal government, is statistically tied for the lead with former Massachusetts Gov.

            "input": "text:Natalie took a marker pen and on the shop window wrote  201cALL YOU CAN EAT. PAY AS YOU WISH. 201d   201cI liked the idea because it had a funny side and it was easy. The response was good from the start, so we thought okay we can keep going until further notice. 201d  They never had to stop.  More than eight years later, the restaurant, Der Wiener Deewan, still lets customers set their own price; those who insist on a number are directed to a take-away menu with prices ranging from 4.5 to 9.5 euro ($6.12 to $12.92).  The three-room, 75-seat restaurant serves five curry dishes, rice, salad and dessert. When customers are ready to go, they pay the cashier, stating what they had to drink (alcoholic beverages and packaged soft drinks are a fixed price) and what they want to pay for the food. The philosophy is simple, Natalie explained:  201cThey should choose based on how much they ate, how much they liked the food and how much money they have. 201d  Der Wiener Deewan is one of a growing number of restaurants that allow customers to choose their own price. Among them: Pay As You Please in Ireland, Lentil as Anything 2019s four restaurants in Australia, the Seva Cafe in India, Annalakshmi 2019s two restaurants in Singapore, and five Panera Cares cafes in the United States.  It might seem like a recipe for financial disaster. Why pay if you don 2019t have to? But the vast majority of customers do pay  2014 a study of the restaurant by economists Gerhard Riener of the University of Dusseldorf and Christian Traxler of the Hertie School of Governance, both in Germany, found that only 0.5% of patrons didn 2019t pay anything for their meal.  With an average payment of 5 to 6 euro ($6.84 to $8.21) per person for food, the Deewans aren 2019t getting rich, but they are serving a packed house of about 500 customers a day, enabling the owners to meet their expenses, pay their 15 employees and realise an annual profit of 30,000 to 40,000 euros ($41,043 to $54,724).   201cSince we have a lot of customers who are quite regular they somehow choose a fair price that keeps us running, 201d said Natalie.  That 2019s a common theme. Pay 2013as-you-wish restaurants rely on their customers 2019 sense of goodwill and fair play to remain financially afloat. Some are successful, while others end in disappointment.  In December, the owners of the pay-what-you-wish Five Loaves and Two Fish in Fuzhou, China, announced that the venue has lost the equivalent of $41,000 since it opened last August, with an estimated 20% of customers eating for free. Several US pay-what-you-wish restaurants have shut their doors in recent years, including Terra Bite Lounge in Seattle and Santorini Grill in New York. Panera Bread has had success with its non-profit Panera Cares cafes, but the for-profit Panera Bread restaurants recently suspended a pay-what-you-wish offer on turkey chili, after a disappointing response from customers. The program, though self-sustaining, was mostly ignored by patrons.  Ayelet Gneezy, associate marketing professor at the University of California San Diego in the US, believes that cultural factors may influence a pay-what-you-wish restaurant 2019s success, noting that the model appears to do well in countries with high taxes and strong social welfare systems. The culture of an individual shop is also important. That may be why Panera 2019s chili offer failed even as the non-profit cafes have done well, she said.   201cIf you go into a Panera Cares cafe, you know what it 2019s about. When you go to a regular [Panera Bread] cafe in a mall, you don 2019t know what it means, 201d said Gneezy.  201cIt 2019s not in keeping with the identity of the store, so maybe you don 2019t pay attention to it. 201d  Appealing to a higher cause is one way that many such restaurants encourage generosity. In addition to Panera Cares, the United States has several independent non-profit restaurants that employ the pay-as-you-wish model.  In Melbourne, Australia, Lentil as Anything restaurants also operate as not-for-profit enterprises that are staffed by volunteers and a smaller number modestly paid employees. There, better-off patrons are encouraged to pay a little more so that customers of lesser means can have a meal more cheaply  2014 and the restaurant can still stay afloat. Payments are anonymous, slipped into a black box at the front of the restaurant.  Founder Shanaka Fernando said the 14-year-old establishment is self-sustaining and all of the profits go toward building more restaurants  2014 there are now four, all in the Melbourne, Australia, metro area. The busiest Lentil As Anything, located in a former 1850s convent, serves 1,500 meals day. In addition to the chain 2019s 120 volunteers, the restaurants are staffed by 40 employees, though their pay (from $65 to $120 a day) is often more a stipend than a salary.  But sterling intentions don 2019t always guarantee success. A Lentil as Anything restaurant in a primary and secondary school canteen closed after 18 months because students didn 2019t respect the system; a take-away restaurant also failed to inspire generosity.   201cWe found that they have to feel the experience, 201d of sitting in the restaurant said Fernando.  The same goes for Killarney, Ireland, Pay as You Please owners Rob O 2019Reilly and Barry McBride, who see their share of free riders. Teenagers, in particular, can be a headache.   201cThey don 2019t know any better about the hard work that goes on in the background, so they pay 20 cents or something for loads of stuff, 201d said O 2019Reilly.  The owners responded such antics by displaying a small sign saying that customers 18 and under must be accompanied by an adult, though O 2019Reilly stresses that most of their teenage customers do not abuse the system and are very welcome in the restaurant.  As with Der Wiener Deewan, Pay As You Please makes up for the occasional freeloader with volume. In Killarney, a tourist town with more than 100 restaurants, media attention, word of mouth and sheer curiosity keep Pay As You Please bustling during the summer, when outdoor seating enables them to serve as many as 120 meals a day (the restaurant itself seats 25). The restaurant makes enough to provide salaries for themselves and six employees, as well as pay all the restaurant 2019s bills.  The restaurant gives customers a list of suggested prices and a tin can at their table in which to deposit the payment of their choice.  The loose system, O 2019Reilly hopes, creates a more relaxing experience for the customer, who won 2019t have to stress about adding extras.   201cNormally, you want more cake or more coffee you 2019re thinking  2018All of this is going to add up to a lot. 2019 We wanted it to feel more like you were in someone 2019s house.

            "input": "text:Recently the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games announced that they had completed their  food vision . I won't dwell on what this was, but it was final proof that the word  vision  has suffered drastic devaluation. Once it applied to the experiences of exalted saints and prophets, which inspired dazzling paintings and books of the Bible. Now it means something slightly stronger than  memo .  The suburban borough of Croydon has also been subject to repeated  visions  over the past two decades, namely Croydon: The Future; Vision 20:20 and Will Alsop's Third City. Famous architects have zipped in and flourished brightly coloured images that turn Croydon's pervasive grey into flashes of neon, and striven to find an inner Manhattan in its array of towers.  There have been TV shows and articles, mostly with same shtick: Croydon is sexy, really. Yet, as Emma Peters, head of planning, regeneration and conservation, pithily remarks:  Every time we have another vision we've declined economically.  From 1995 to 2005, when employment in London grew by 18%, in Croydon it grew not at all.  The borough hasn't given up, however, which is why I find myself sitting with a group of planners who are trying to make the place better. Opposite me is Finn Williams, pale and delicate as a consumptive poet, who looks a decade younger than his 27 years. To one side is Vincent Lacovara,31, and to the other Tom Sweeney, aged 35. They are describing the deals they are making with heavyweight developers, and their efforts to steer many millions of pounds of investment to beneficial effect.  Planners aren't supposed to look like this. Normally you expect them to be worn and middle-aged, and to have turned the colour of manila through blending with their environment, as certain moths come to resemble tree bark. Williams, Lacovara and Sweeney are signs of the borough's intent to do things differently. It is a long-standing ambition, given new impetus by the arrival in 2007 of Jon Rouse as the borough's chief executive. Rouse, a former chief excutive of both the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment and the Housing Corporation, is one of the country's more effective civil servants.  The selection of this young band of planners could just be another doomed attempt to sex up Croydon, but what is striking is their determination not to do another  vision .  Every plan for Croydon,  says Williams,  has always been desperate to undo the mistakes of the previous plan.  Lacovara adds:  The first question people ask when we consult them is: 'Is anything going to happen this time?'   They embody the attitude of many young architects, which is to take things as you find them rather than impose a grand plan, and to find the spirit of the place, even if that place is not particularly charming. In the 18th century, Capability Brown talked of genius loci in the design of landscapes. These contemporary architects apply the same attitude to office blocks, rather than hills and woods. They also think there's something good about suburbs, in contrast with older architects such as Lord Rogers, for whom dense, Barcelona-like cities are everything.  In the case of Croydon the place was once delightful enough for the Archbishop of Canterbury to build his holiday home there, and it keeps fragments of its ancient past. It was then a stolid Victorian town, before the spread of London's semi-detached suburbia absorbed it into the metropolis. In the 1960s, thanks to a quirk of official policy, it boomed. The government wanted to push new office development out of the centre of London, with the result that it migrated to Croydon.  Its distinctive skyline of stubby towers was created, but when policy was reversed, so was the boom. Croydon has struggled ever since, with BT the latest business to move out. It has resumed its status as a place that prompts faint sniggers among metropolitan types, despite being the location of the world's first international airport, and the town where Malcolm McLaren pioneered punk. It may have given the world Kate Moss, but she now lives elsewhere. Terry Major-Ball, the gnome-selling brother of John Major, was the Croydon resident who stayed.  Yet it is only 15 minutes by train from central London, and the borough's mixture of suburban semis, detached houses and terraced streets mean that there are homes for every stage of life ( nursery to nursing home  as Lacovara puts it). And given the desperate hunger for homes in southern England, it can't be impossible to make it into a place where people want to live. Much of it already is, but the centre remains problematic.  Williams and co don't want to make it into something it is not, but a better version of what it is now. Their proposals are mostly quite obvious, like building a bridge across dividing railway tracks, planting trees, removing the most destructive 1960s road systems, and making it possible to access public places now cut off by roads. But they also get developers to think about what's good and  or distinctive about Croydon, such as its tendency to place little and large buildings, and ancient and modern ones, side by side.  Above all, although they stress that previous visions left behind ideas of value, like opening up the buried river Wandle, they want something to happen this time. In this they are not just a bunch of young turks, but part of a collective effort that includes more experienced officers such as Emma Peters. This effort includes the creation of delivery vehicles and joint ventures and other devices too technical to be digested over Sunday breakfast, but none the less important. If they succeed, they could finally make Croydon an example that other towns will follow.  There are some things to like about the designs for the new US embassy, unveiled last week. That it is moving from posh Mayfair to tattier Battersea is good for both places, as the residents of one hated the effects of security barriers, while the other could do with the investment.  It claims to be exceptionally green, and its architects KieranTimberlake have a record that makes this believable. The design deals with the immense security measures by trying to disguise them as landscaping, which is at least tactful, while the intricate surfaces shown in the images give an air of quality.  Yet it is a lump. A green, well-dressed, diplomatic lump, but still an ungainly, dominating object that makes minimal attempt to relate to its surroundings. There is no sense that it will join with its existing and future neighbours in creating a cohesive piece of city. It will be a singular object that will loom awkwardly over what is already a disjointed area of London.  For this blame does not only attach to the state department or the architects, but also to the inability of London's planners, from the mayor down, to plan in three dimensions. Battersea was identified as a place of opportunity under Ken Livingstone, meaning that it would be a place where office towers could flourish, yet there has been minimal investment in designing what kind of places this new development might create.  What will make this area succeed or fail is not the artistry of individual facades, but the kind of places that will be made by several buildings working together. And, yes, as many have pointed out, the embassy does look like a Norman keep, complete with moat. We all know it has to be exceptionally bomb-proof, but was it really necessary to rub this point in? Summary: Croydon gave the world Kate Moss, but can it ever be sexy? An exciting team of young planners are set to revive the south London suburb and blaze a trail for all British towns, writes Rowan Moore",

A young woman who seems to be of east European extraction answers the door. She asks me to follow her into Lord Snowdon's office. The house is grand and dark. It's a funny hybrid - part English castle, part hacienda. We go through the kitchen and past a row of his lordship's hats and caps, through an alley of iconic framed photographs (Marlene Dietrich, Noel Coward), past a pristine studio and a toiletful of honorary doctorates, and finally on to his study. There in the corner, sitting on a swivel chair with castors, handsome and shrunken, is Antony Armstrong-Jones, aka Lord Snowdon.  He has had an amazing life, and has so many stories to tell, it's difficult to know where to start: Eton; childhood polio; the failed architecture student who became the establishment's photographer; marriage to Princess Margaret; their tempestuous relationship; their children, Viscount David Linley and Lady Sarah Chatto; the affairs; his second marriage (five months after divorcing Margaret) to Lucy Lindsay-Hogg, and his daughter by her, Lady Frances; the suicide of long-term mistress Ann Hills; photography; his design of the aviary at London zoo; the affair with Country Life features editor Melanie Cable-Alexander, which resulted in the collapse of his second marriage and the birth of  secret love child  Jasper in 1998.  But there is also his famous discretion. So many people have said the marvellous thing about him is that despite everything, he has remained wonderfully discreet through the years.  Snowdon,75, looks me up and down when I shake his hand.  Are you English?  he says. I have a slight tan. Do I not look English? I ask.   No, no, no,  says a tall man with Victorian sideburns and a Welsh accent.  I don't think Lord Snowdon means it like that. He means as opposed to Welsh or Scottish or whatever.  This pleasant, conciliatory chap is Rhodri Ellis Owen, a publicist promoting Snowdon's appeal to raise  00a32.2m for the construction of a new  00a39m building on top of Snowdon (the mountain, not the man). Ellis Owen has offered the Guardian this interview. But Snowdon doesn't know why I'm here. More alarming, he doesn't know why Ellis Owen is here.  I tell him I'm here to interview him. He nods silently. When did he realise he was a good photographer?  I haven't yet.  He smiles and his blue eyes twinkle. It's a lovely, mischievous smile that gives just a hint of the charm he has employed on so many women over the years.  Can he remember the first photograph he took?  No.  The smile has gone. He makes no effort to think it through. I sense he is waiting to be amused, and I'm already failing.  Can he remember, roughly, when he started to enjoy taking photographs?  I always liked taking photographs. I should think I was seven or eight.  What camera did he use?  There's one over there on the shelf.  He sends me out of the room into the gloomy hallway to look for it. I pick up an old camera and bring it back.   There's an earlier one as well. A box camera.  I return with another, but it's the wrong one. Snowdon is getting irritated.  A little tiny one. No , not that one. A tiny little box. Sammy Davis Jr gave it to me.   Eventually, I find the right camera.  It's lovely, isn't it?  he says.  Blimey, I say, Sammy Davis Jr just dropped in to give you a camera? How come?  He just gave it to me.   What was he doing at your house?  I can't remember. He just sent it to me. I never met him.   Have you never been curious how you got a camera from Sammy Davis Jr without having met him?  No, I can't remember. I really can't remember.   It was his uncle, theatre designer Oliver Messel, who knew all the stars. He worshipped Messel. He tells me how, when he was in hospital with polio as a boy, Noel Coward and Marlene Dietrich would visit him and sing songs. They sang to you?, I say, amazed.  Yeassss. Yeassssss .  He is transported - momentarily.  Did he call her Auntie Marlene?  No, I didn't. I still call her Miss Dietrich.  What did she sing?  Boys in the Backroom.  He sings a line.  Do you remember that one?  he says nostalgically, looking at Eamonn the photographer.  Hospital, he says, taught him so much. In what way?  By seeing people and being with people who were much worse off than I was.  Perhaps, I suggest, this is what gave him an interest in taking pictures of patients in mental hospitals and people with spina bifida.  Well, my grandfather was a doctor,  he says, keen to contradict me.  How old was he when he was in hospital?  God knows! I should think 16, what!  Was he in a children's ward?  No.  With adults?  No. I was on my own most of the time.   In front of Snowdon is a desk full of photographs, some taken by him, some not. They tell his life story. There is Margaret, bare-shouldered and lovely, her half-moon face fading to black, his astonishingly beautiful mother Anne-Armstrong-Jones in Cleopatra headgear, his grandmother looking like Peggy Ashcroft, his children, the Queen in her majesty, Prince Charles in hysterics, Diana of course, even the Duke of Edinburgh looking unusually civil. Snowdon's critics say that as a photographer he doesn't have a distinctive style. Others have suggested that his skill, whether witting or unwitting, lies in showing the carapace of royal life - there are no inner depths, all is surface. Snowdon likes the idea that he doesn't have a style. That's how it should be, he says, otherwise the photographer becomes more prominent than the subject.  He seems rather lonely here, surrounded by his photographs and doctorates and nameplates.  After Eton, he went to Cambridge to study architecture. He gave up two years into his course to pursue photography. Was that because it was easier?  Yeassss. You see, photography isn't an art.  What are photographers if not artists?  Snappers.  For the first time in a while, the boyish smile resurfaces.  I tell him that I read he wouldn't get out of bed for less than four figures.  Oh, bollocks!  he says.  Try working for Vogue. Yah ... no money at all. Fifty pounds a page, which was maximum. I didn't make much money when I designed the aviary either.  Snowdon's aviary at London zoo is probably his proudest creation.  I got paid  00a3143, and it took me three years.  Lucky you had the family around to subsidise you, I say.  Well, yes.   In 1960, when he was 30, he married Princess Margaret. It was a controversial wedding - not only were there suggestions that Margaret was on the rebound (she had been told she couldn't marry Group Captain Peter Townsend because he was a divorcee), but Tony Armstrong-Jones was a commoner. There's not much common about you, I say.  Oh, I don't know.  He smiles. It's amazing that they dismissed you as a down-at-heel tradesman when you had lived such a privileged life, I say. The smile disappears.  What a snob you are,  he says sniffily.  Dylan, his assistant-cum-servant, lifts him out of his chair and half-carries him into another room to have his photo taken. Suddenly he looks so slight, so vulnerable, like a rag doll. His polio has left him with an increasingly painful lameness. While he is away, I look at a photograph he took of Damien Hirst - Hirst has been elevated to a work of art, surrounded by fish in one of his shark tanks.  Dylan returns Snowdon to the room and lifts him into his seat. I tell him I like the Hirst picture.  Oh God! Yah,  he says. Did he not get on with Hirst?  I don't really know him. The thing is, when you take photographs, you meet a lot of people but you don't actually know anybody. It is very quick, in and out, in a concentrated way.   Perhaps that's what appeals to him about photography. So how does he create instant intimacy?  It's being as straight as you can.  Honest?  Yes. And it's not always flattery.  Though it has to be said he has flattered a good many people over the decades.  Does he have a favourite portrait here?  No,  he says brusquely. Anyway, he doesn't like the word portrait.  Too pompous.   What does he think of when he looks at his famous snap of Princess Margaret?  She was incredibly beautiful. Incredibly beautiful.  He trails off.  I don't like photographs anyway. There aren't any in the house except here. I don't like them in the house. I would rather have paintings.  Despite his insistence that he is lucky and has had a wonderful life, behind the smile and twinkling eyes, there seems to be a bitterness, even self-loathing.  I'm staring at the photograph of Margaret. She looks so mellow, I say, it's hard to believe she was so fiery. Snowdon asks me what I mean. Well, I say, their relationship was famously intense - didn't Lord Lichfield say that when they argued, it was like an exchange of gunfire? Snowdon explodes.  Well, Lichfield would know fuck all about it, so you can tell him to piss orf.   I get the feeling I'm running out of time. So I look at the signed picture of Diana, say it is beautiful and that she was obviously very fond of him. He doesn't respond. So I read him a quote from Diana on the back of Brian Hoey's biography of Snowdon.  Tony is one of the warmest people I know, but like me, he knows what he wants out of life and is determined to get it. He's nobody's fool and his gentle exterior hides a toughness that he has had to learn, again like me.    I wouldn't go by too many quotes. Now we must go on. Dylan!   Dylan arrives.   Are we going to be late?  he says to Dylan, beseechingly.  Dylan gives him a look.  Ah yes,  he improvises,  we're going to be very late, yes ...    He is showing me the way out. Rhodri is panicking because we've not yet talked about the Snowdon building. Meanwhile, I'm desperately trying to stop myself being chucked out. Snowdon has invented quirkly little things through his life. Has he got any here?  Oh yes,  he says. All hostilities cease.  They're not inventions,  he says.  I've done a few optical things. That's one.  He passes me a trompe-l'oeil object - a glass ball.  You're holding it the wrong way,  he says with a grin.  You're still holding it the wrong way.  I turn it again.  Be inquisitive,  he says.  Within seconds, the humour has turned to anger.   No!   he bawls. I ask him if it has been designed to make people feel stupid.  No, most people do it quicker than you. What is it?   I tell him I can see the world upside down?  Now you're vereh stupid.   Please tell me, I say. I feel like an idiot.   Well, it's a clock, isn't it?   Why is it a clock?  Well you're incredibleh stupid.   I feel humiliated. He calls Eamonn to look at the ball. Eamonn spots the clock instantly. And still Snowdon is rubbing it in.  You took longer than anybody else. See how stupid you were.   Please, I say, perhaps there's another optical thing I can look at to show I'm not quite so stupid.  No, not really,  he says.  Now I must go. Are we going to be late?    We're going to be very late, yes,  Dylan says.  Somehow, Dylan has ushered me to the back door without me even saying goodbye. He then leaves to uncork a bottle of wine.  I'm sure you'll be wanting a glass of wine after that, Lord Snowdon,  he calls out. It's almost 11.30am.  I return to the study to fetch my bag and shake hands with Lord Snowdon.   Lovely meeting you,  he says, flashing the smile and the eyes.   00b7 The Snowdonia Society is a charitable organisation.

            "input": "text:Duty is never a good reason for doing anything. It is certainly not a good reason to look at art. Looking at the list of the photographers in Cruel and Tender: The Real in the Twentieth Century Photograph, about to open at Tate Modern, the burden of duty, in the end, is all I felt. So many, I would have to look at so many.  Even reading to the end of the exhibition's title feels like a chore. I would have to be troubled by Diane Arbus, moved by Walker Evans, aware of the immense contemporary influence of Stephen Shore, shocked and embarrassed by Boris Mikhailov. I can't face it; I'm not going.  To be bored in advance seems rude. But recently I've had to admit something to myself. I find photography in art galleries, framed and hung on the wall, almost entirely unrewarding. It was never my favourite, but I always thought it was, you know, modern and progressive, something to be taken seriously. The rot set in while looking at an exhibition of classic photographs of New York at the city's Jewish Museum. Here was a great Weegee image of people at the beach at Coney Island in the 1940s. A wonderful picture that I first saw in a magazine or somewhere years ago, and always loved. Here it was, a silvery print, on the wall. It was disappointing.  In frames on the wall is the opposite of the way we experience photographs in real life. In real life, there are photos everywhere. Their significance is unflagged. You read the paper, a picture on page eight catches your eye. You look at someone's holiday photos, one seems touching. Perhaps none of the many photos you see each day means anything to you at all: nobody is saying they have to.  Many would agree that photography is wonderful precisely in its ordinariness, its availability, its functional honesty, and that those who want to set it up as art are the snobs, the enemies of photography. But photography's  democracy  is an illusion. Photography lends itself to pretension of all kinds. Ever since it was invented, photography, the child of science, has been experiencing an  artistic  adolescence.  Even William Henry Fox Talbot couldn't resist giving his account of his discoveries the sub-poetic title The Pencil of Nature. Before you could finish holding the pose for a Victorian photograph, middle-class dilettantes were making sickly sweet religious art and taking pictures of children in the nude. Then came Alfred Stieglitz, the father of American modern art and photography's most pompous prophet: for Stieglitz, there was a fixed gulf between the banality of everyday photography and the preoccupation with light shadow and form of the photographer-artist.  Today, that modernist idea of high art made with the camera has vanished, and the old forms of lens-snobbery along with it. Photography is praised precisely for its lack of distinction, its ease of access, its universality. And yet the pretensions are grander than ever. There is a widespread belief that photography has an apocalyptic destiny in the history of art.  When the camera was invented, the old forms of art - those hallowed hand-made arts of painting and sculpture - were exposed as relics of privilege and stale tradition, dead, ritualised, essentially class- and faith-bound practices, doomed to be displaced by the mass medium of photography. The German Marxist Walter Benjamin argued something like this in the early 20th century.  Today it has become the small change of conversation, an id 00e9e re 00e7ue, a truth universally acknowledged. We now accept that photography  ended  the cults of painting and sculpture and, I suppose, medals and engraving, and brought about a new, more democratic, more truthful art, one that is appropriate to our culture, that speaks to us. Routinely, people will say that paintings of modern warfare by Dix, Beckmann or Picasso are feeble and deceitful compared to the immediacy of a photograph - even though we have copious evidence going back to the American civil war that war photographs are not unmediated truths but manipulated visual statements.  It bothers me that even after photography has marginalised every other kind of image, even when our culture is saturated by unquantifiable varieties of photographic information, we feel we ought to be speaking up for the photograph, for its invincible superiority to other media. There is a bullying, unquestioning crassness to today's hegemony of the photograph, expressed in a constant need to declare the camera's unique art-historical mission to eradicate all previous art forms. Even when it comes to the great modern exponents of high art, we want to reduce them to photographers. Thus exhibitions have been dedicated to the photography of Degas and Picasso. Neither Degas nor Picasso believed that their photography was high art. Not even Warhol believed his photos were his real art - when he talked about  my art , including giving it up, he meant his paintings. Warhol was the last modernist. That is, he was the last great exponent of a type of 20th-century art profoundly hostile to the photograph. Modernism hated photography. It wanted to be the opposite of photography. The cult of photography today may even be the reason it is currently impossible to make modern art.  Today we can scarcely even grasp what modernism was in visual art- how ambitious, revolutionary, high, how beyond old and new. We want to make modernism more like us, and we do this by reinventing it as photography. Jackson Pollock allowed his neighbour Hans Namuth to photograph him at work in 1950. Namuth's photos have become 20th-century classics, an interpretation, an iconic remaking, of Pollock as artist. In a disturbing way, these photographs have displaced Pollock's paintings: we can't think about Pollock without thinking about the photographs. And yet, they were never more than a record at best, a footnote, with very slight explanatory power. They tell us almost nothing about Pollock the painter. Looking at One or Autumn Rhythm is not made any easier by the existence of these photographs; nor would anyone at the time have expected it to be.  Modernist artists were good at posing for the camera. There are wonderful pictures of Picasso in his old age, like the funny one by Robert Doisneau where he poses at lunch with bread rolls arranged to look like giant hands. This is a nice sub-cubist joke - but you cannot replicate the complexity and richness of a Picasso in a photo. No photograph has ever been made that is as modern, as revolutionary, as the cubist paintings Picasso made almost 100 years ago. Nor will there ever be such a photograph.  Those stumbling attempts at abstract photography, the Rayograms, the photomontages, look so strained. Our art history, corrupted by the lens, gives far too much credence to the flimsy and naive attempts by 20th-century photographers to reproduce the innovations of 20th-century painting. That woman with a cat's face, that other woman who looks like a violin - would anyone really trade any avant-garde snapshot for the least work of Matisse, the most tentative Pollock?  Modern art was not, as we kid ourselves, empathetic with photography. On the contrary, the artists who assimilated and imitated photography were 19th-century academics; G 00e9r 00f4me's paintings of ancient Rome with their chilly verisimilitude are flatly photographic; Bouguereau's titillating nudes have the pallor of the photographer's studio. Banally reproducing appearances while indulging lazy fantasies,  contemporary  in its tackiness while deeply conservative in its emulation of what it thought was Renaissance pictorialism, this is the art that modernism set out to destroy.  Modernism - Seurat's perforated classicism, C 00e9zanne's broken essays - began in the 19th century as an attack on appearances, the received, the apparent. On the photographic.  Photography cannot rival the visual and intellectual fullness of high modernist painting and sculpture. It ends up looking silly. Modernist photography is a curio at best. In truth, photography's great seduction is its verisimilitude, its power of imitation - that is, it does, better than painting, the most conservative thing that painting can do. It is this aspect of photography, I suppose, that Tate Modern means by  the real in the 20th-century photograph . The instant sublimity of Andreas Gursky, the frank exploitation of Boris Mikhailov. What we want from a photograph is what we used to get from painting: a plausible picture of the world. This is great, but modernism denied that it was the function of high art. The dominance of camera-based art today is a confession of our inability to continue, or to face, the revolutionary art of modernism.  It is photography that has reduced our expectations of art to a few stock, one-dimensional reactions: shock and horror, or pity, or lust. In the end, photographs don't deliver more than information - here's something grotesque, here's something funny, here's something austerely impressive. The mysterious and utopian possibilities of Picasso or Pollock are nowhere to be found as you walk through a photography exhibition.   00b7 Cruel and Tender is at Tate Modern, Bankside, London SE1 from June 5.

They could show up to vote. Or not, which has been their historical pattern in midterm elections.  Millennials are also crucial to this election. In 2012, they helped Obama nudge his way to the top; their votes flipped four key states to his favor 2014including Florida. By 2016, they 2019re expected to make up a third of all voters.

When it 2019s so crazy, it 2019s nice to see old friends. 201d  The two first met when both had minor roles in 2008 2019s  201cThe Other Boleyn Girl. 201d In true six degrees fashion, Cumberbatch played Hawking in a 2004 BBC-TV movie (Redmayne elected not to see it so it wouldn 2019t influence his own performance). It was directed by Philip Martin, who directed Redmayne in the BBC miniseries  201cBirdsong 201d (2012).  Redmayne 2019s oeuvre  2014 he won a Tony for the 2010 play  201cRed, 201d starred opposite Michelle Williams in 2011 2019s  201cMy Week With Marilyn, 201d and didn 2019t embarrass himself singing as heartthrob Marius in 2012 2019s  201cLes Miserables 201d  2014 has earned him praise and a teen following (Redmayniacs, in Internet parlance). Still, it didn 2019t indicate he 2019d be able to deliver a tour de force performance as Hawking, which recalls Daniel Day-Lewis in  201cMy Left Foot. 201d Redmayne plays Hawking from his days as a Cambridge grad student who woos and marries Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones). It 2019s a portrait that changes dramatically, of course, when Hawking develops motor neuron disease due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) that leaves him paralyzed and unable to speak. And eventually that portrait includes triumph, with the publishing of Hawking 2019s landmark book,  201cA Brief History of Time, 201d which leads to international acclaim.  Redmayne studied art history at Cambridge, and recalls glimpsing professor Hawking there.   201cI was lucky enough to go to Cambridge so I 2019d actually seen Stephen from a distance  2014 the silhouette in a wheelchair  2014 and I 2019d heard his voice, 201d he says.  201cBut I gave up science when I was 12 or 13. Then I read this script, about this extraordinary woman [Wilde] and an unconventional love story behind the icon. Every page was a revelation, so I fought hard to get the part. It was a privilege; I mean, a real privilege. 201d   201cThe Theory of Everything 201d is based on Jane (Wilde) Hawking 2019s 2008 memoir  201cTravelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen, 201d which details the joys and complexities of their 25-year marriage.  201cI didn 2019t audition, 201d says Redmayne.  201cBut I had many conversations with [director James Marsh] on the phone. Finally we met for lunch in a pub. I had several pints and I got the part. When Felicity auditioned, he wanted me to be there and I knew all the executives were going to see it. So even though he said I had the part, the audition with Felicity felt like an audition for me. 201d  Liam Daniel   Focus Features  Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones in  201cTheory of Everything. 201d  When did panic set in?  201cIt was a millisecond of euphoria followed by nine months of fear, 201d says Redmayne.  201cThe stakes were high. 201d  He prepared for five months, working with a team that included a vocal coach, choreographer, makeup artist, and Dr. Katie Sidle, an ALS specialist. Without film footage of young Hawking, who was stricken at 21, Redmayne brought vintage photos to Dr. Sidle and she explained the pace of Hawking 2019s deterioration.   201cThere 2019s both wilting and rigidity with ALS, and it varies from person to person, 201d Redmayne says.  201cSo she would look at the photos and ascertain where [Hawking] was by the way he was holding his hand or his foot. I charted my way through, and I also met others suffering from the disease and saw the reality of their day-to-day lives. ... Stephen has the most expressive face, even though there 2019s loss of muscle. I spent a lot of time in front of the mirror next to the iPad trying to access muscles I haven 2019t used before. So the memory of Stephen is now in my face. 201d  Marsh, director of the Oscar-winning documentary  201cMan on Wire, 201d says he never considered making a Hawking documentary.   201cThis isn 2019t a biopic of Stephen Hawking; it 2019s actually about a marriage. Jane gets the same amount of screen time and a point of view. It 2019s a portrait of two people and an interesting relationship, that 2019s the focus. I was intrigued by the emotional lives of the characters. Most of us think we know Hawking  2014 the iconic image of the man in the wheelchair with the strange, robotic voice. But I didn 2019t know anything. I didn 2019t know he had children. That 2019s rich territory for drama. 201d  For both director and star, one of the most daunting moments of the shoot came when Hawking,72, visited the set in England.  201cWe sought his approval before we started and, tacitly but not effusively, he wasn 2019t going to get in our way. But it was conditional, 201d says Marsh.  201cHe came to the set on day two, which raised the stakes for Eddie. He was already dealing with difficult stuff and then Stephen shows up like a spaceship coming down to land, his face lit by this strong LED monitor. But I think [Hawking] enjoyed the spectacle of it and when we showed him [footage], I know he was moved. He may say he wasn 2019t, but you could see it had an impact. And he let us use his [computer-generated] voice. He said the film was  2018broadly true. 2019 I 2019ll take that. 201d  For Redmayne,  201cThe Theory of Everything 201d remains, above all, a love story.   201cIt 2019s about passionate love, love of science, love of family, but at same time the cost, the foibles, the complications of love. It 2019s uplifting but it 2019s not glossed over. That was important to me, 201d he says.  201cWhen Jane and Stephen saw it and approved and were so generous to us, that meant the world. 201d  - An emotionally satisfying experience in Toronto  - In Toronto, what they 2019re talking about at the festival  - Fall movies aim high Summary: Eddie Redmayne is generating early Oscar buzz for his first leading-man role as iconic astrophysicist Stephen Hawking in  201cThe Theory of Everything. 201d",

Big data, Syn bio, sensors,  2026all can be combined   2014 Vivek Wadhwa (@wadhwa) October 16, 2014  To which I immediately thought: Wait a minute. Didn 2019t venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins try to do this very same thing in 2006, when it raised $200 million for what it called the Pandemic and Bio Defense Fund? According to a press release, its goal was to  201caccelerate innovations for worldwide pandemic preparedness and global health over the next three years, with a focus on surveillance and detection, diagnostics, vaccines and drugs. 201d  The fund launched with the announcement of an investment in publicly-held BioCryst BCRX , which later had an emergency-use swine flu drug approved in 2009, and also has been working on an Ebola vaccine. It later would back such companies as flu-focused NovaVax NVAX , which also has an Ebola drug in the pipeline, and Trius Therapeutics, a developer of superbug antibiotics that was acquired for more than $700 million by Cubist Pharmaceuticals CBST .  But that three-year investment period is long past, and Kleiner Perkins never raised a follow-on fund. So what happened? Is this stuff just too hard and or unprofitable for Silicon Valley venture capitalists to pursue? Must they instead occupy themselves with the bits side of these problems, and leave the molecules to someone else?  To get some insights, I spoke with Beth Seidenberg, a healthcare-focused partner with Kleiner Perkins who helped to manage the Pandemic and Bio Defense fund. Here were some takeaways:  Seidenberg says that she has not backed a pandemic-type company in the past couple of years, as some of her focus has shifted toward healthcare IT, but adds that any future deals would follow the same investment strategy as was used for the Pandemic and Bio Defense fund.  201cTo focus an entire company around a single pandemic is just too risky, even from a venture capital perspective. They are too dependent not only on the pandemic occurring, but also on governments for choosing to purchase their product. They key is still finding a great company that can help fight a pandemic is it occurs but, if it doesn 2019t, will still do fine. 201d  Sign up for Dan 2019s daily newsletter on deals & dealmakers: www.GetTermSheet.com Summary: Back in 2006, venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins set out to help fight pandemics.",

We are not on their list. 201d  He affirmed what I had already suspected, so I got the bank 2019s contact information from him.  The lender 2019s response was the standard  201cYou are not on our approved-attorney list. 201d When I asked to be added, I was told,  201cNo, our list is closed. 201d   201cYou cannot do the closing since you have no relationship with the bank. 201d  Mindful of the law on this subject, I explained to her that since the customer was paying the bank charges, it was my understanding that I could do the closing because he requested my office. I told her of our relationship and that my office was going to do the closing for free (I still like the guy). She wouldn 2019t budge. She did, however, explain that we could review the documents. No kidding.  I 2019m still annoyed by this, so I wanted to delve into it for you. If you have an experienced real estate attorney, I don 2019t see why he or she could not do a closing for you regardless of whether that person is on the list. It is my understanding that if you are paying the bank fees, you can chose your own provider of service. In Massachusetts, a loan file must be supervised and closed by a licensed practicing attorney.  Brian Koss, executive vice president at Mortgage Network Inc. in Danvers, said his firm allows one-time approvals if the customer is requesting a particular attorney to close a loan.  But what if your lender denies this request? You have two choices: You can ask for its list of approved attorneys and pick one, or you can find another lender.  If you chose the former, I would call all of the providers, within reason, and ask about their pricing. Although there is some standardization, usually a set fee, I would probably use the provider whose price was right in the middle. I would also inquire about the location of the closing; do they provide in-home service?  In short, if you have an experienced attorney, tell the lender you want to use that office. If the bank denies the request, I would strongly consider taking your business somewhere else. Summary: Lenders sometimes have lists of approved attorneys.

            "input": "text:Ever since fast-food workers walked off their jobs in New York City in November 2012 to demand $15 per hour, that dollar figure has been the rallying cry of the low-wage worker movement.  The campaign has had some notable wins lately, as Wal-Mart, Target, T.J.Maxx, and McDonald 2019s announced increases to their minimum wages.  Despite of all the talk about $15 per hour, there hasn 2019t been a lot of conversation about who precisely earns less than that figure.  The National Employment Law Project, an organization that supports raising the minimum wage and the unionization of workers, aims to change that on Monday, with the release of a new study that paints a more detailed picture of the worker who takes home less than $15 per hour 2014or $31,000 annually for full-time work. Here 2019s what NELP discovered:  1. They 2019re more common than you might think  It 2019s easy to assume that workers earning less than $15 is a small subset of the workforce. But, in fact, 42% of all workers in the United States fit this bill. Just over half of all African Americans earn less than $15 an hour, and nearly 60% of Latinos make that hourly sum.  2. They are disproportionately female, African American, or Latino  Even though women make up less than half of the overall U.S. workforce, they constitute 55% of all sub-$15 per hour wage earners. You find a similar misalignment for African American workers, who constitute almost 12% of the workforce but 15% of earners who make less than $15. Latino Americans are overrepresented in the sub-$15 category as well; they account for 23% of sub-$15 per hour earners in the U.S. but only 17% of all workers.  Workers who earn less than $15 per hour are also older than you might expect: 46.3% of them are 35 or older.  3. They likely work in a service industry  Fast-food and retail sales reps have led the push for a $15 per hour minimum wage, and for good reason. A combined 7.7 million workers in retail sales and food preparation jobs earn less than $15 per hour. The occupations that are flush with sub-$15 per hour earners may not be all that surprising, but it 2019s worth noting that six of the 10 largest occupations with median wages less than $15 are also among the jobs projected to grow the most by 2022: retail salespersons, combined food preparation and serving workers, laborers and freight movers, janitors and cleaners (except maids and housekeeping cleaners), stock clerks and order fillers, nursing assistants, and personal care aides.  The results of NELP 2019s report 2014that nearly half of all U.S. workers are making less than $15 2014 201dchallenge us to think about the future of this country, 201d says Irene Tung, a senior policy researcher for NELP.

Even though it costs 15 percent or more to borrow in the commercialpaper market and a prime-rate bank loan costs 18 1 2 to 19 percent, many corporate treasurers prefer to borrow short-term money and wait for long-term interest rates to decline before selling bonds or debentures.  Consequently, less than $400 million of new corporate issues are scheduled for sale this week. Interest rates for long-term corporate issues are at or near their highest levels ever, and so are Treasury issues that come due in more than five years. Yields on long-term corporate issues are scaled upward from the 13.04 percent yield on outstanding 30-year Treasury bonds.  After a month of heavy Treasury borrowing, which helped increase interest rates for intermediate and long-term maturities, analysts expect the Treasury to confine its financing to the bill market until late in March when two-year and four-year notes will be sold.  Today the Treasury will sell $8.6 billion of bills, evenly divided between three- and six-month maturities. On Wednesday it plans to sell $3 billion of cash management bills due in 38 days. These short-term bills, which are intended to carry the Treasury through its low cash period before the March 15 and April 15 tax payment dates, are sold in minimum denominations of $1 million.  Agency financing this week includes a $500 million issue of fouryear Federal National Mortgage Association debentures, to be priced tomorrow.  In the tax-exempt market, analysts note that last week's new issues sold well, though record high yields were required to attract investors. For example, Aaa-rated Illinois bonds carried yields ranging from 7 percent in 1982 to 8.45 percent in 1991, 9.7 percent in 2001 and 9.85 percent in 2004-06. Analysts say Illinois bonds typically trade with yields that are about the same as New Jersey bonds, or a shade lower for longer-term maturities.  Curiously, while yields increase with longer maturities in the taxexempt market, exactly the opposite is true for Treasury securities. Yields there decline as maturities lengthen. For example, three-month Treasury bills at a discount rate of 14.4 percent have a bond equivalent yield of nearly 15.1 percent, compared with 14.07 percent for two-year Treasury notes and 13.04 percent for 30-year Treasury bonds.  Buyers of short term tax-exempt paper will have a good supply tomorrow, when the Department of Housing and Urban Development sells $1.5 billion of Government-guaranteed local housing project notes. On Friday, according to analysts at Smith Barney, outstanding sixmonth H.U.D. notes were yielding about 7.1 percent.  The following new fixed-income securities are scheduled this week: TAXABLE TUESDAY  Pacific Power and Light, $100 million of first mortgage bonds, due 1991, rated Baa by Moody's.

He made two of his four points and then came to the third. ''Next to lastly,'' he began, and then stopped. ''There must be a better way to say that,'' he said.  ''Penultimately!'' the puzzlers seated in the grand ballroom shouted at once. And with its usual exacting humor, the contest got under way.  This weekend, with some new additions, they were back for the fourth annual tournament, the nation's largest public competition in what is, for most of them, a private obsession with the witty and pedantic possibilities of the English language. At least, most of them were back.  Daniel Pratt, who won first place last year, did not return to defend his championship. He was said to be at a Scrabble contest, a report of disloyalty that produced mixed emotions.  ''To me, that's hilarious,'' said B. J. Krintzman, who had come from Massachusetts, where she is managing director of the Boston Shakespeare Company. She was having a drink with some others in the hotel bar. Revered for Her Puns  ''To me, that's insulting,'' said Maura Jacobson, smiling thinly. A constructor of puzzles for New York magazine and an author of puzzle books, Mrs. Jacobson is revered among puzzle devotees for her puns. She constructs puzzles for this national contest and is still remembered for one in which there was this clue: ''post-Watergate Nixon.''  Answer: ''Mopy Dick.'' Mrs. Jacobson is one of only five or fewer people in the whole country who successfully make a living from the construction of their favorite hobby, the crossword puzzle. This fact emerged at lunch yesterday, between rounds of competition, when someone asked how many people were able to make puzzling their vocation. ''Don't you mean their livelihood?'' she said. ''There's a difference, you know.'' Mrs. Jacobson and such puzzluminaries as Will Shortz, who persuaded Indiana University to let him construct a major in, and take a degree in, Enigmatology - the study of puzzles - like to mention a Gallup Poll in 1974 that found that more than 40 million Americans work at least an occasional crossword puzzle.  According to Doug Heller, a puzzle magazine editor, crossword and other word puzzles published in newspapers, magazines and books are constructed by a volunteer assortment of perhaps 600 people of various interests, ranging from a state judge in Arkansas through convicts in various prisons to at least some atomic scientists.  Many of them do it free, just for the satisfaction, an ardor that tends to cool the commercial possibilites of puzzle-making. The eight puzzles by which the creme de la creme was separated here this weekend were commissioned for a total of just $490. A Challenge for Most  And even among people who claim to solve The New York Times Sunday crossword puzzle in from five to 35 minutes - and who came from as far as California to compete - some of these puzzles were a challenge.  The tournament took place at 48 green-clothed tables in the ballroom in a competitive atmosphere so intense that only the noiseless rush of the air-conditioning could be heard along with the rub of erasers from those who are accustomed to penciling in their words. But there are some who sniff at pencils, spurning them for the glide and challenge of a pen.  ''I find that I can't maintain my interest when I use a pencil,'' said Joel Darrow, a Westchester County resident who works as a money manager and computer programmer in New York. ''With an eraser, it's like working with a net.''  And so Mr. Darrow, who wears large-framed glasses with his hair in an explosion of cloud gray curls, searches out particular pens for their ''speed, clarity of line, and ability to write legible letters with small hand movements.'' Some Caught by the Clock  On the fifth puzzle, a 20-minute stumper ridged with vague clues and obscure terms, Mr. Darrow had been finished for seven full minutes and was comfortably propped up with a book of science fiction when Mr. Shortz, the moderator, called out, ''Time's up.'' But Herbert Norman, of Cedarhurst, L.I., and Vicki Scher, of Flushing, Queens, were caught.  ''Ooohhh,'' the crowd groaned when Mr. Shortz called time. ''That was brutal,'' said Mr. Norman. ''What happens is you think you're so bright and then you come here, and everyone else is so bright you begin to wonder about yourself.'' He had not thought of ''alsike'' for ''pink clover'' and he couldn't figure what five letters should have gone in 13 Down, for ''kind of martini.''  ''I put 'olive,' '' Mr. Norman said to Miss Scher. ''I don't know,'' he sighed. ''Very dry? What did you put?'' ''Vodka,'' she said. Vodka it was. There was another puzzler yesterday afternoon, one of Mrs. Jacobson's. It was 24 Across, ''squeaky-voiced czar,'' for which the answer was ''Ivan the treble.'' Field Narrowed to Three  And then, after the last general elimination puzzle this morning, there were just three of them left competing for the championship: Mr. Darrow; John V. Chervokas, the executive vice president of a Park Avenue advertising agency, and Phillip M. Cohen, of Aliquippa, Pa., a computer consultant and devotee of British cryptic word games.  Working on transparent plastic sheets projected onto screens for the audience's benefit, the three strained silently through ''tuque,'' ''xenia,'' ''swab'' and ''houyhnhnms'' (''the horses in 'Gulliver's Travels' '') and on into ''CDVI,'' for which the clue was simply ''a fifth-century date.''  Mr. Cohen, who said he did not work American puzzles and had never entered a tournament before, could not get that last one. But he got most of the rest, and won. Mr. Darrow was second and Mr. Chervokas third.  Margaret Farrar, who for decades was the first crossword editor of The New York Times and who maintains a working eminence in the field, gave out the awards, and this closing comment, based on something another old hand had told her: ''Norton Rhoades is in his 70's, and he said he thinks puzzles are nutrifying. Well, so do I, because I'm way ahead of him. I'm going to be 84, any minute.''  Illustrations: Photo of Phillip M.

            "input": "text:PRINCETON, N.J. 2014 Clyde Woody, who has lived in the historic black neighborhood here for 36 years, was chatting recently about the latest offer for his two-and-a-half-story house.  ''A white man came by the other day and offered something in the 60's for it,'' recalled Mr. Woody, a retired auto worker, as he sat on the narrow portico of the white clapboard house at 13 Green Street. ''I told him I wasn't interested. He asked would I be interested if the offer was in the 70s. I told him no because, I've got nowhere else to go.''  Mr. Woody is one of a number of black homeowners in the area known as Witherspoon-Jackson who in recent years have been offered sizable sums for their homes by whites.  At least 15 white families have purchased homes in the area in recent years. And some in Princeton, both black and white, fear this will mean irreversible changes in the neighborhood, which was home to Paul Robeson, and the disappearance of a black presence in Princeton that dates to the Colonial era. Search for Middle-Income Homes  Unlike ''gentrification'' efforts by those who restore deteriorating buildings in their search for inexpensive housing, the white influx into Witherspoon-Jackson, with its small, neat homes, stems from a desire for affordable middle-class housing in this increasingly expensive university center, about 50 miles from New York City.  Those concerned with the change emphasized that they had no desire to keep whites out of Witherspoon-Jackson, since there has always been a minority of white homeowners in the neighborhood.  They also say they have no evidence of a concerted effort to remove blacks from the area. But they fear that as the number of elderly black homeowners decreases by death and as more sell to the highest bidders - who, most often, are white - the neighborhood will lose its character.  ''It is really a matter of economics,'' said Joan Hill, a Princeton native who is president of the Witherspoon-Jackson Development Corporation, which is helping blacks finance the purchase of homes in the neighborhood. ''People want single-family homes, and this neighborhood has the lowest-priced housing in Princeton.'' Community Viewed as Magnet  Princeton, which is within relatively easy commuting distance of New York and Philadelphia, ''is a magnet community that draws many affluent people,'' said James Floyd, a former Township Committeeman who in the early 1970's became Princeton's first black Mayor and also its first Democratic Mayor.  ''Unfortunately,'' he went on, ''few of those affluent people are black.'' The demand for homes in Witherspoon-Jackson (named for two of its original boundary streets) developed in the mid-1970's as the pace of business development in Princeton accelerated and as the average price of homes in other parts of the borough and township soared past $125,000.  Offers for homes in the black community, which are primarily of the two-story wood clapboard or stucco style, have been between $50,000 and $70,0, according to Mrs. Hill and several real estate agents.  Adding to the demand is the fact that the neighborhood is just north of the Nassau Street business district and Princeton University.  Blacks constitute about 10 percent of Princeton's combined population of 26,000. Princeton is made up of Princeton Borough, a 1.7-square-mile area that includes the Nassau Street business district and the university, and Princeton Township, a larger and more suburban surrounding area.  In a recent article, The Princeton Packet, a weekly newspaper that has reported extensively on the changes in town, noted that the 1980 census had shown an increase in blacks in the total Princeton area but a decline of 32 percent in Witherspoon-Jackson.  ''The cost of housing here has gone up tremendously,'' said Ellen Clark, an agent of the Henderson Realty Company in Princeton. ''The demand is for the central borough area, and that demand is going to change neighborhoods.''  Mrs. Clark, who lives in a moderate-income apartment development in Princeton Township, added, ''I don't want to see the black community disappear, but anybody who has the money has the right to buy.'' A Sale to White Family  Myrna and Peter Bearse, who are white, bought their home in Witherspoon-Jackson, at 110 Leigh Avenue, for $36,900 six years ago. Most of the longtime homeowners on Leigh Avenue are black, but there are several white families that have lived there for years. The Bearses bought from a white family.  Mrs. Bearse is an advertising copywriter for a local advertising agency. Mr. Bearse is director of economic development for a Philadelphia corporation. They have two girls, aged 7 and 10.  Asked why they had chosen the home, Mrs. Bearse said that after considering its price and proximity to the center of Princeton, ''we had positive feelings about the community and the people.''  ''It seemed like a good place to raise our children,'' she said. ''Our positive feelings have proven to be correct. ''We knew were moving into a predominantly black community, but it wasn't anything we saw as a problem. The people who sold us our home said they had had a fine relationship with their neighbors, and so have we. We're all neighbors here.'' Summary: Clyde Woody, who has lived in the historic black neighborhood here for 36 years, was chatting recently about the latest offer for his two-and-a-half-story house.   ''A white man came by the other day and offered something in the 60's for it,'' recalled Mr. Woody, a retired auto worker, as he sat on the narrow portico of the white clapboard house at 13 Green Street. ''I told him I wasn't interested. He asked would I be interested if the offer was in the 70s. I told him no because, I've got nowhere else to go.''   Mr. Woody is one of a number of black homeowners in the area known as Witherspoon-Jackson who in recent years have been offered sizable sums for their homes by whites.",

''I WAS playing a game with my three sisters in the living room when we heard a loud bang.'' This is an 8-year-old boy telling us how his father shot himself at the age of 29. He is one of about 20 children Jill Krementz photographed and interviewed for ''How It Feels When a Parent Dies.''  The boy, whose name is Jack, said that his father must have known he was going to shoot himself because he had paid all the bills the day before. Jack's family thinks his father is in heaven, but he's not sure. His grandmother and his aunt say that his father shot himself for their sake, because he was sick, but again Jack is not convinced.  For three months, he didn't talk to anyone, and then one day he said to himself, ''Jack, you might just as well relax and don't think about him and just live your life.'' He does keep his father's colognes in his room, though, because he liked the way he used to smell. Heartbreaking Things  Miss Krementz has a way of inducing, or allowing children to say heartbreaking things. One girl of 15 did all of her crying secretly, on horseback. A boy of 8 went around the house turning out all the lights after his father died. A girl of 6 says that, after she lost her mother, she didn't like going to the bathroom all by herself in restaurants or museums.  ''I know what you must be going through - here, have some brownies'': This is what adult friends said to an 8-year-old girl whose father was killed in a car crash. She believes it would have been easier if he had had a long sickness so that they could have grown used to the idea of his dying. A 13-year-old girl whose mother died when she was 6 admits that she resents people who keep telling her how well they knew her mother, as if it were a competition. Once, this girl says, she dreamed that her mother was lying at the bottom of a closet. A 15-year-old boy thinks it's worse to have a parent who hates you than to lose one.  Many of the children interviewed by Miss Krementz feel ashamed in the face of bereavement, as if it were a personal deformity. They talk about being teased or stared at and they have a sense of embarrassing their friends. A common complaint is that friends don't seem to be able to act natural with a child who has lost a parent. Surrounding by silence and constraint, the child feels doubly isolated in the world.  A boy of 16 whose mother died asks his father to stop smoking, observing that ''there's no one else after you.'' A 15-year-old boy who lost his mother says, ''Now I know I can take just about anything.'' A 16-year-old girl remembers that when she was 11, her paralyzed mother was so thin that she would go with her mother to stores and try on dresses intended for her. Differing Attitudes  Some parents protect their children against the last stages of terminal illness by not letting them go to the hospital. Some even keep children away from the funeral. Families seem to differ widely in their attitudes toward cemeteries. One girl feels that the cemetery is not a fair representation of her mother. She would rather recall happy scenes. Another family finds the cemetery a lovely place and picnics there.  A common complaint of these children is that the surviving parent doesn't talk enough about feelings. It seems that death almost always leaves children groping for words. In ''How It Feels When a Parent Dies,'' Miss Krementz has helped them to find and pronounce the words. Reading them, we are reminded once again how much children know and how well they can tell it if we will listen.

            "input": "text:WASHINGTON, April 25 2014 Richard Richards, the Republican national chairman, wants his party to start changing the mechanics of Presidential campaigns, especially to shorten them and to curb ''independent expenditures'' by anyone other than candidates or parties.  Mr. Richards said in an interview that he would soon appoint a special committee to look into several problems with the existing system and to consider some possible solutions. The panel would report to the Republican National Committee later this year, he added.  Mr. Richards indicated that his efforts were aimed not only at making specific changes in the political process but also at ending the Democrats' near monopoly on changes in the system.  Either through changes in their own party rules or through their control of Congress, Democrats have been almost entirely responsible for the ways in which the Presidential election system has changed in recent years. Republicans have generally gone along without significant protest, sometimes turning the Democratic-inspired changes to their advantage. Independent Expenditures Opposed  One of the changes that has helped his party's candidates was singled out by Mr. Richards for criticism when he attacked the ''damned independent expenditure system.''  According to preliminary figures of the Federal Election Commission, independent groups and individuals spent about $15 million on the 1980 elections, most of it on the Presidential campaign and nearly all of it in support of Republicans.  ''Sure, we benefited more than the Democrats did,'' he said. ''But if it's not a good system then you can't justify it by who benefits.''  Mr. Richards said that the system, under which such groups as the National Conservative Political Action Committee spent more than $3 million last year, was ''fraught with mischief'' and contended that candidates could be hurt when uncoordinated spending designed to help them was overdone or done badly.  Moreover, he said the independent groups did not make it clear enough that they were not formally associated with the candidate. ''I think candidates and parties ought to be responsible for running their own campaigns,'' he added. Shorter Campaigns Favored  The party chairman said he had no particular ideas about how to curb such expenditures, which have mushroomed since recent Supreme Court decisions treated them as constitutionally protected free speech.  But on another complaint, the duration of the Presidential campaign, he said the special committee should consider such alternatives to the prolonged primary system as regional primaries and the greater use of state party conventions to pick delegates for national Presidential nominating conventions.  He contended the current system was ''just a killing pace for candidates and for everyone else.'' Among the other topics he identified as worth a hard look by Republicans were open primaries, in which voters of any party and independents can vote in any party's Presidential primary that they prefer; the $1,000 limit on individual campaign contributions, which has not been changed since 1974 despite rising inflation rates, and the practice by television networks of ''forecasting results before the polls have closed.'' Summary: Richard Richards, the Republican national chairman, wants his party to start changing the mechanics of Presidential campaigns, especially to shorten them and to curb ''independent expenditures'' by anyone other than candidates or parties.

            "input": "text:CANTON, Nov. 6 2014 There is a huge amusement park here, with half a dozen outdoor theaters, a roller-skating rink, shooting gallery, Ferris wheel, aquarium, and in the trees hang gaudy lanterns. Young lovers can be seen kissing in the dark and groups of men kibbitz excitedly around players of Chinese chess.  People are trying to have fun again in China. Canton is special, practically a border town touched by all kinds of foreign influences not yet felt in the interior. But the scene is a startling show of how much things have turned around in a couple of years.  It is still almost impossible to grasp the enormity of what the Cultural Revolution and the preceding fits and starts of radicalism alternating with a little relaxation did to this country. Yet that is the background against which the attempt is now being made to stabilize the nation and focus on producing, with a minimum of ideology.  No one knows for sure, but some experts say that 3 million people died in the Cultural Revolution, including suicides as well as killings. Even worse in terms of national ability to move forward is the loss of human skills and training - older people rejected and incapacitated, youths who learned nothing but shouting and abuse.  ''All the old cliches are gone,'' said a Western veteran of Peking. There are flies again, though not many; there is crime; there is unemployment, becoming particularly worrisome in this society where a person's whole life is regulated and administered by his or her place of work.  One sight is unchanged, though. The children still look wonderful, healthy, well-tended. I never saw a ragamuffin anywhere, nor a child with sores. That is extraordinary in a poor country, even in the poorer parts of rich countries. Fathers coddle their offspring in public as never before. The injunction against more than one child per couple seems to be taking hold, at least in the cities, and it is changing emotional habits.  Families can be seen taking their ease. They go sightseeing. Thousands of foreigners plod through palaces and gardens daily, but now they are hugely outnumbered by Chinese on outings to admire old monuments and famous scenic views. You have to leave Peking at dawn to get to the Great Wall without being stopped in a day-long traffic jam. The past gives pride again.  Many Chinese have acquired cameras and they pose stiffly for one another alongside a latticed window or a stone lion. Damaged sculptures and crudely defaced ancient inscriptions bear witness to how recently all that was old, refined and cultured was anathema. But there is so much, and now it is cherished.  At the Historical Museum in Peking, a guide apologized that the only catalog available in English was ''obsolete'' and has to be rewritten. It was published in 1976 and the text is largely a diatribe against Confucius throughout the ages. He hasn't been rehabilitated yet, but much else has, including foreigners, whose role in China has described as much of a zigzag as that of Confucius.  It is amusing to find pale-faced, long-nosed figurines from the early medieval T'ang Dynasty in the delightful provincial museum of Xian, alongside the superbly modeled courtiers, maidens, horses and camels. They represent merchants from Asia Minor who plied the Silk Road, and one curly-haired fellow looked remarkably Greek. The Chinese-Western relationship goes back very far, and it has been stormy.  Invariably, Western visitors are addressed as ''friends'' now. But in the classic Chinese opera, which has been fully revived, the makeup for heroes and heroines is rosy, for villains stark white, and for clumsy ne'er-do-wells a patch of white around the nose and mouth shading into darker tones at the edge of the face. Tradition dictates the meaning of color.  The handful of Americans and other Westerners who were early sympathizers with the Communists and stayed to live through it all seem a sad vestige of sour illusions now. One couple, Sol and Pat Adler, who established themselves in Peking during the Joe McCarthy witch-hunts in the United States, still seemed hard-put to grasp their experience.  Said he, with a toss of his long yellow-gray hair, ''It was easier to know from outside. We knew nothing.'' Her large, round blue eyes shining, she said, ''Well, partly one wanted to believe. It was progressive.''  There are no more ready absolutes in or about China for those with a yen for certainties. On the day news of Ronald Reagan's victory reached Peking, a Chinese newspaperwoman asked, with bewilderment in her voice, ''But if he is so much against Soviet expansion, why doesn't he care more for the alliance with China?''  She was reminded that there is no U.S.-China alliance. That was taking things too far. She persisted, ''Good relations, that is.'' It seemed to her that Americans had to choose, and their dislike of any style of Communism could only be secondary.  The sights and sounds of China are extremely varied once again. The monolithic veneer has cracked. Summary: There is a huge amusement park here, with half a dozen outdoor theaters, a roller-skating rink, shooting gallery, Ferris wheel, aquarium, and in the trees hang gaudy lanterns. Young lovers can be seen kissing in the dark and groups of men kibbitz excitedly around players of Chinese chess.   People are trying to have fun again in China.

We modestly suggest a more telling barometer: what we 2019ll call  201cThe Steakhouse Index. 201d That 2019s our take on how those great, extremely pricey, expense-account-sensitive purveyors of prime aged beef and creamed spinach are faring a half-decade after the onset of the financial crisis.  This writer 2019s survey is more atmospheric than scientific, as it consists of witnessing the traffic and ambience while dining in late August at three renowned Midtown steakhouses and interviewing their owners and ma 00eetre d 2019s. The institutions, ranking among the top-grossing restaurants in America, are Del Frisco 2019s DFRG Double Eagle Steak House, the ultimate hangout for financial power-players across from Rockefeller Center; Porter House New York, a virtual neighborhood canteen for the corporate elite in the Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle; and Smith & Wollensky, a bastion of tradition in a turn-of-the-last-century, white-and-green lattice home at the nexus of the ad industry on Third Avenue.  The managers and owners of all three steakhouses agree that business still hasn 2019t returned to the heady levels of the mid-2000s and perhaps never will.  201cWe 2019ve just seen too many controls on spending by companies to get back to the heyday, 201d says Scott Gould, regional manager for Del Frisco 2019s Restaurant Group. Still, the spending at these culinary landmarks has rebounded strongly since the financial crisis  2014 retracing at least half the distance from the bottom  2014 and they 2019re thriving even though Midtown now supports several more steakhouses than during the boom times.  MORE: Energy 2019s unexpected jobs boom  The sizzle is back for two reasons. First, big banks, ad agencies, and law firms are finally, though judiciously, re-loosening their wallets for entertaining. Second, hordes of affluent foreign tourists, lured by the weak dollar, are filling tables on weekends and late at night following an evening at a Broadway show.  Among Manhattan business folk, the steak dinner is as much a staple for entertaining clients as the power breakfast. And tourists have long prized a visit to the Palm or Smith & Wollensky as a must-dine experience. But in the bubble years, the extravagance buried all tradition.  201cGroups of four investment bankers would order five bottles of sparkling water, and six appetizers, along with $250 bottles of Bordeaux, 201d recalls Gould. Servings of Del Frisco 2019s Royal Ossetra caviar flew off the menu.  201cIt was a time for huge shellfish bouquets, colossal stone crab claws, and oversized steaks, 201d marvels Michael Stillman, president of Fourth Wall Restaurants, manager of Smith & Wollensky.  In late 2008, the unbridled revelry stopped.  201cIt happened really quickly, over a couple of months, and business dropped around 20%, 201d says Stillman. At Del Frisco 2019s, it wasn 2019t that the number of customers dropped, it was what they spent.  201cThe difference was in the drop in orders for high-end luxury items, 201d recalls Gould.  201cDiners would get glasses of water instead of bottles, and three appetizers instead of five. 201d It was clear that companies were getting frugal, imposing tight limits on what they 2019d pay for each person for an expense-account dinner. For Del Frisco 2019s, the problems plaguing the banks weren 2019t entirely bad for business, since the law firms handling their new regulatory problems started spending more freely than ever on its prime strip steaks and crispy Shanghai calamari.  MORE: The death of private equity 2019s fee hogs  Porter House opened at the height of the party, in late 2006.  201cDiners would be looking out through our big windows at 15 Central Park West, one of the world 2019s most expensive residences, being built. The new owners would come in to celebrate the closings, 201d says Michael Lomonaco, the restaurant 2019s executive chef and managing partner. Then, the world changed, and so did the menu. Steakhouses sell lots of expensive red wines. In the downturn, says Lomonaco,  201cwe dug deep to find more value in wines. 201d He introduced an array of Argentinian, Spanish, and Italian offerings at far lower prices than the traditional Bordeaux.  201cMalbec became the grape of the day, 201d he says. Porter House even appealed to newly budget-conscious patrons by adding tasty-but-plebian hanger steak and skirt steak to the menu.  At Smith & Wollensky, Stillman 2019s biggest worry was that the whole celebratory appeal of the steakhouse experience had disappeared.  201cWe 2019re not a health food restaurant, 201d he says,  201cpeople come in for small celebrations, like closing deals. 201d He refers to the steakhouse  00e9lan with the Italian term  201cabbondanza, 201d for abundance or extravagance.  201cPart of steakhouse lore took a hit, 201d Stillman continues.  201cPeople felt uncomfortable indulging, they had a new sense of propriety because of troubles in the economy. It 2019s a meal to let loose, and letting loose felt uncomfortable. That takes the edge off the classic steakhouse devil-may-care atmosphere. 201d  Today, the  00e9lan is back. At 6:30 on a recent Tuesday evening at Del Frisco 2019s, the place was packed, with most diners in suits and ties, and surely on expense accounts. Gould notes that though business clients still aren 2019t spending as much per person as at the peak, the tourists from nearby hotels fill the tables on weekends and after Broadway performances.  MORE: KKR vets get more time to raise new fund  At Porter House, the clientele is less business folk entertaining clients and more the affluent who live nearby. On an evening there late last year, this writer spotted Goldman Sachs GS chief Lloyd Blankfein, former Citigroup C chairman Dick Parsons, ex-Barclays BCS CEO Bob Diamond, and political pundit Dick Morris circulating among fellow luminaries.  201cBusiness really picked up in the fourth quarter of 2012, 201d says Lomonaco.  201cIt was a double-digit improvement over the bottom. 201d Foreign visitors who shop their way to the Time Warner Center 2019s fourth floor discover the Porter House and walk in sans reservations.  201cI 2019ve never seen this level of foreign diners, especially steak lovers from Brazil and Argentina, 201d says Director of Operations Anthony Mardach. Lomonaco has even dropped the bargain hanger steak and added a $53 boneless strip.  Stillman says Smith & Wollensky is holding more corporate parties for the thirtysomething set who work for private equity firms and tech companies that recently arrived in Midtown. And individual diners are spending a lot more than three years ago  2014 a tribute to the durability of steakhouse allure.  201cThey 2019re more sophisticated diners, 201d he says.  201cThey want to know about how long the steaks have been aged. They want to know about high-end Spanish wines, and wines from Oregon. They 2019re a lot more savvy about how they spend their money. They want to know whether we 2019re using local ingredients. 201d It wasn 2019t the same sense of whirlwind, shared experience when folks were settling for a small Caesar salad, he says.  That old steakhouse spirit, and most of the spending, is back. The steakhouse splurge means New York is back. And if the Big Apple is back, well, that 2019s got to be good for the whole steak-and-potatoes country.

Our family motto is we never attack but we retaliate,  says Ice,57, making that message to the competition clear: Watch your backs next week. Just like in the hard-edged rap lyrics that made him famous, the  star even name-checks a few of his. It's only fair that Ice and Coco feel like they've earned their stripes for a little constructive trash-talk  2013 they had to attend daytime boot camp before getting the greenlight for the Fox series.  Below, the couple  2013 who announced Monday that they are   2013 reveal what goes on in talk-show basic training, plus how their dog's and of course Coco's formidable derri 00e8re will play into the new show.  I was really anti-reality [before  ], so they were like,  Let's do a talk show.  Then before we got to do the talk show, they talked me into doing a pilot for the reality show, and it came out so good that I was like, 'As long as we don't have to be mean and do dumb stuff, we'll do it.' The reality show was good and at the end of three seasons, I was like, 'Okay, enough, let's get back to our real life,' and they were like, 'Look, you're so hot on television, let's do ... a talk show.' Everybody believes that Coco and I can really pull this off. We went to talk-show boot camp out in L.A. where they gave us some pointers and stuff, and we're just going to take a swing at it. We're just going to take a go. It's really, a lot of people believe we can pull this off, so now they got me believin' it. [  They kind of sit you down like a school, and you have to run through all the talk shows that are on TV. You run down everything from cue cards to teleprompters. I didn't know how detail-oriented talk shows were. You think you just go up there and you just ramble and you just talk, but it's a little more than that. They had us actually in front of a camera doing our thing. We had fun!  I've been on hundreds of talk shows, I've just never hosted 'em. So you do learn there's a lot of stuff that goes into it. Once again, we just went there and did our thing, and they were like, 'You did incredible, it was amazing.' Okay? Cool.  I'm glad you think so!  I think it's funky just because of who we are you know like we're not a normal couple. It's more like a rock n' roll marriage, you know. It's a lot of flavor, it's a lot of coolness that you might pick up from the show that you don't get from  or one of your normal talk show hosts. I think it's gonna be a little more interesting especially with me because I'm off the chain, nobody knows what I'm going to say say next.  We compare ourselves to Sharon and Ozzy Osbourne a lot.  Yeah, that's one of my idols, Sharon. She does it all, she's a very powerful woman, you know she doesn't do what I do, but she does the business side of it, which I like to do. And I model myself after her, you know she has a crazy husband that's totally off the wall, and she just sticks by him no matter what  2013 that's me too.  Ozzy's the illest guy in rock n' roll, you know. I'm on the top 10 of the craziest people in hip-hop, so we got a very similar type edge going there. But I don't watch daytime television, I have a job, I work and, you know, I think daytime television is really for women. I've never seen a guy in the audience, for somebody like Wendy [Williams] or something, so I'm gonna try to bring a male edge to it. I watch Steve Harvey, he does his thing and stuff, so I think it's good to have a counterpoint now with a married couple just going out there having fun, and I think the key with Coco and I is our chemistry.  I'm pretty open book, I'm also the kind of person that will say, 'That's none of your business,' too, you know. What we're going to do is we're going to continue some of the stuff that you didn't see in reality show  2013 we're gonna take you in and let you see the house now that it's complete. We're going to let you see Coco's shoe closet 2013  That no one has seen before, I've been keeping that a secret.  Our second bulldog Maximus is now huge, he has a daughter. You're going to see a lot of people from the reality show you'll see Soulgee, you'll see the dogs, you'll see Coco's sister, little Ice. The reality show still had one level of separation, we're going to drop that level so now you're not only watching   2013 you're talking to them.  Oh it could be a whole episode, I could tell you that.  They're going to be roaming around on the set. You'll see them as we tape. We wanted to make the same vibe as the reality show and transfer it to a talk-show vibe. You're going to see the dogs and Maximus' daughter is Marco Andretti's dog, which is a good friend of ours, so he's going to be on the show. [It's] very family-oriented, anybody can watch the show.  The cool thing about it is the people that are actually helping us do the show actually come from   2013 imagine that. They're really trying to break the walls and do something totally different and something that's crazy and fun with us. The dogs are just going to roam and do what they do because you can't control a dog. If you're guesting and a dog gets into your lap, we're going to see how you handle that.

Applications to purchase a home 2014a closely watched indicator of the housing recovery 2014fell 4 percent on the week and are 17 percent below year-ago volumes. This does not bode well for home sales as the market moves from the traditionally robust spring season to the slower summer months.   The lack of movement on mortgage applications even with a significant drop in rates confirms what we have seen for much of the past five years. Namely, that lower rates alone are not enough to generate home purchase activity,  said Guy Cecala of Inside Mortgage Finance.  Home prices, mortgage underwriting, employment, and a basic belief that it is a good time to buy home are major factors that seem to influence home buying more than rates.

It begs the question, why are more Americans not taking advantage of lower rates to buy homes?  The answer may be that many people are struggling with their personal finances. A new survey from the MacArthur Foundation, conducted by Hart Research Associates, found that while the public may believe the housing crisis is improving, many respondents do not feel personal relief with their monthly housing costs: seven in 10 believe the U.S. housing market is still in the middle of the crisis or that the worst is yet to come.

Under the new policy, for example, a firm that invests in China through companies in Hong Kong or Singapore to take advantage of tax benefits that do not exist between China and its home country could find itself on the wrong side of Beijing tax authorities if it cannot prove it has substantial business operations there or employees on the ground.  Apple's success in China can teach US firms a lot   Companies are increasingly putting substance in their holding companies,  Chang said.  Andrew Choy, Greater China International Tax Services Leader at Ernst & Young, said the GAAR rules are a signal that companies need to pay attention to tax planning.   In general, people will be more conservative,  Choy said.  Chinese regulators hit Microsoft with about $140 million in back taxes last November, an early case of what could be a wave of  targeted actions  to stop profits going overseas, according officials at China's State Administration of Taxation.  With a slowing economy likely to reduce 2015 fiscal revenue growth to a three-decade low of just 1 percent, according to a Deutsche Bank report, it makes sense for Beijing to try to boost its coffers.  Tax specialists say companies need to be aware that China's tax regime is evolving, albeit as part of a global trend to curb tax avoidance.  At a meeting of G-20 leaders in Australia in November, Chinese President Xi Jinping endorsed a global effort to crack down on international tax avoidance.   Compared to the U.S. or the UK, China's tax rules are still simpler. But China doesn't want to be seen as an undeveloped country with tax rules. It wants to catch up to other international players,  Chang, of Hogan Lovells said.  At the forefront of evolving international tax policy is the debate about whether the right to tax should be tilted towards industrialized, capital exporting countries where firms reside, or so-called source countries such as China, where many generate significant profit.   There is a large element from a government policy perspective that has to do with whether China is going to tax particular profits or some other country,  said Jon Eichelberger, a tax expert and partner at Baker & McKenzie's Beijing office.  Chinese state media has said tax evasion and avoidance by foreign companies costs the world's second largest economy at least 30 billion yuan ($4.8 billion) in tax revenues each year.  Larry Sussman, managing partner at O'Melveny & Myers' Beijing office, said the scope of the scrutiny could also reach private equity firms and M&A activity.   Anything cross-border coming in and coming out, for that matter, which could implicate Chinese investors,  Sussman said.  Despite the elaboration to the GAAR rules, they remain loosely defined, giving tax authorities discretion on whether companies meet the demands for economic substance.  James Zimmerman, Chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said Chamber members welcomed an upgrade to the tax regime, so long as the policies were consistent with China's World Trade Organization obligations.   AmCham-China is hopeful that the Chinese government will apply the tax laws and regulations in a fair, uniform, and transparent manner, and we will be monitoring China's enforcement record going forward on behalf of our member companies,  Zimmerman said. Summary: China's vow to increase tax scrutiny of foreign companies has sent firms rushing to tax advisers ahead of the implementation of new rules.",

            "input": "text:* Wing part from missing MH370 in hands of French judiciary  * Civil investigators fear safety work could be compromised  * Tensions emerged after Germanwings disaster  PARIS, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Air crash investigators risk being sidelined in a tussle to unlock the secrets of lost flight MH370, fuelling concerns that their role in making flying safer could be diminished.  By drifting on to Reunion Island, the barnacled remains of a Boeing wing part from the Malaysia Airlines jet have given the upper hand to a French judicial investigation, exposing for the second time this year how civil crash investigations struggle to compete with police-led probes.  For decades, reconstructions of disasters by specialist safety investigators have been seen as crucial to making aviation safer, with accident rates at historically low levels.  But in dozens of countries, notably France, they exist in uneasy co-habitation with separate criminal inquiries.  Simmering tensions over the sharing of evidence between civil and judicial investigators came into the open after the crash of a Germanwings jet into the French Alps in March.  They are under scrutiny again after Indian Ocean currents deposited the  flaperon  from the missing Malaysia Airlines flight into the hands of judges investigating the suspected manslaughter of four French citizens out of 239 people on board.  How France handles both cases could have a wider impact given its influence over aviation safety worldwide and the similarity between its civil-law system and most other jurisdictions.  Its BEA safety investigation board is regularly called in to look at incidents because France is home to Airbus, which makes up 42 percent of the world jetliner fleet.   Criminal investigation should not compromise the important role that air accident investigation plays in keeping flying safe,  said Kevin Hiatt, safety chief at the International Air Transport Association, the trade association for airlines.  Supporters of the French system of parallel investigations say it prevents cover-ups, supports families and benefits from stronger powers of discovery.  Concerns about judicial interference may cut little ice with MH370 families who have been frustrated at the apparent lack of results from the civil investigation into the disappearance of the Kuala Lumpur to Beijing flight.   This kind of closed, unjust, and totally inefficient investigation is really hard for me to understand,  said Jiang Hui, a Chinese man whose mother was aboard Flight MH370.  Civil crash investigators follow United Nations guidelines from the International Civil Aviation Organization. Their sole aim is to help prevent future accidents by finding out causes.   The idea has never been to establish who is the bad guy, for the simple reason that it does no good when it comes to improving safety,  said Paul-Louis Arslanian, former director of France's BEA air safety investigation agency.   It is better to understand why errors were committed and what prevented this being identified.   It is a rare example of an industry being granted a global remit to ensure its safe development. But the 70-year-old system must reckon with modern demands for stricter corporate liability and the social media storm generated by every crash.  Add to this the fact that human factors have become a priority as technology reduces mechanical vulnerabilities, and experts say the pressure to cast blame is greater than ever.  While families wait for clues about the missing jet, 17 months after MH370 mysteriously vanished, the flaperon risks being submerged once again by jurisdictional in-fighting.  It was recovered by the gendarmerie on the French island, a military force accountable to French judges leading the criminal probe and not to the BEA or its Malaysian counterparts.  Relations between the gendarmerie and BEA have been prickly for years and hit a new low hours after the Germanwings crash that killed 150 people.  In an unprecedented move, the BEA's current director was summoned to police offices to face questions about the speed at which it had shared just-deciphered cockpit recordings, according to several people familiar with the incident.  Those tensions are fresh in the minds of those now handling the MH370 investigation. While prosecutors have pledged to share their findings in due course, a judicial source stressed the flaperon would remain under judicial control.  Experts from several international agencies were allowed to witness its inspection but only after a delay of several days and under a judge's supervision, and not on BEA premises.   However you paint it, it gives the impression that the BEA and other investigators are working for the judiciary,  said another former air crash investigator.   It is a power struggle and in the long term it may be damaging for credibility of crash investigators generally.   Malaysia played down any conflict between the judicial probe and its own civil investigation, of which the BEA is part.   They will go hand in hand. There's no clear distinction between their report and our report. Whatever they find they will add onto our investigation later,  Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai told Reuters.  But experts say it is a further setback for the Southeast Asian nation which struggled to establish an independent investigation in the face of criticism, only to see the first physical piece of evidence fall into the possession of French judges who have been asserting primacy over air accidents.  That may in turn heap pressure on a landmark EU law designed to preserve a  balance  between judicial and civil probes.   I get worried when I see that we are not advancing as quickly as we should, that we are going backwards or trampling on the confidence that should exist between different parties,  said Arslanian, one of the architects of the 2010 regulation.   For now the trust between national and international partners is there, but you have to keep building it every day.   The debate about the blurring of judicial and civil roles could complicate efforts to improve safety by openly discussing problems in everyday operations.   A lot of aviation professionals are fearful that by being frank to technical investigators they could end up in court,  said Andreas Matteou, an Airbus A320 training captain.   The risk is that they will just fly on autopilot and share as little as possible.

Sylvia Allegretto, an economist with Berkeley's Center for Labor Research and Education and one of the report's authors, said workers in the restaurant industry are especially likely to be enrolled in one or more government program.  But, she said, the findings are indicative of the broader challenges many low-wage workers are facing in trying to make ends meet without extra help. She noted that most recipients of the major government programs they looked at are in a household in which at least one person is working.

You can't deny what's happened to real median household incomes, but the question beyond that is well, what do you do about that? Are we advocating rolling back globalization and raising trade barriers and making the U.S. more isolationist, where you can only buy American-made products?  Ashworth said.

They focused on nonmanagerial fast-food workers who had worked at least 11 hours a week for 27 or more weeks per year.  Many people think of fast-food work as a job for teenagers, but the report found that many people holding those jobs were adults. About 23 percent of the workers were teens ages 16 to 18, compared to about 26 percent of front-line fast-food workers who were adults with children of their own. About half were adults with no children.   2014By CNBC's Allison Linn. Follow her on Twitter @allisondlinn and Google or send her an email.

            "input": "text:are still  Hung Up  in court in a transatlantic custody squabble over 15-year-old son Rocco.  While the teen was traveling with his mom on her Rebel Heart tour for three months in the fall, a Ritchie source told PEOPLE he  in the U.K. in an act of rebellion. When he refused to return to the U.S. for the holidays, Madonna,57, appeared in a New York City courtroom on Dec. 23, where a judge reportedly  to sort out his living situation.  Despite the judge's order, sources have alleged Rocco hasn't returned home yet, that he  since moving in with his dad in December, and that  between Madonna and Ritchie, 47.  The exes are due in court for a second hearing in New York on Feb. 3, and PEOPLE spoke to a divorce and family law expert who is not involved in their case to weigh in on what's next.   The courts know how difficult it is to get a teenager to do what he wants to do, which as a practical matter gives the child a louder voice than maybe he should have,  Michael Stutman  2013 head of the family group at Mischon de Reya New York  2013 tells PEOPLE.  Sometimes you're creating more problems than you solve by trying to force a teenager to do what they don't want to.   And if the two parents are not united with respect to the child, the child will exploit those differences and get what he wants.   Below, Stutman answers the big questions regarding this international custody battle as it heats up.  I would be surprised if the judge's order did not say,  You are to return the child by such and such date.  I doubt that the order was that open-ended because otherwise it's difficult to exploit it.  I would be asking if Mr. Ritchie bought Rocco a plane ticket. I wonder what he has communicated to Madonna to let her know he's trying his best to get Rocco back to New York. If he can't show he is making a significant effort, he has a long road ahead of him.  If there are procedures in England similar to a U.S. writ of habeas corpus, Madonna could petition for the courts to recognize the New York court order and force Guy Ritchie to produce the boy. Should she choose to do so and prevail, Rocco could be on the next flight back to New York.  Madonna and son Rocco Ritchie  That puts Mr. Richie in a very poor situation vis-a-vis the New York proceeding, and it puts him in  . Assuming that the judge's order is a valid and enforceable court order and the court has jurisdiction  2013 and it seems as though it does  2013 Guy Richie would have to bring the child into a courthouse in the U.K. or be arrested for his failure to do so.  But, you have a 15-year-old who apparently has some wherewithal and apparently a mind of his own. So judges can be extremely persuasive and probably can still impress upon a 15-year-old what that 15-year-old needs to do. I would suspect that when the judge would tell Rocco,  you are leaving now with your mom  that would happen, but what happens when Rocco gets home with his mom? That's anybody's guess.  To be clear, Rocco isn't a party in this case. The court ordered Guy Ritchie to return Rocco to his mother. Rocco's refusal to come home is merely a demonstration of the fact that he is still a teenager and will be treated as such by the courts.  Rocco missing school certainly doesn't help Guy Ritchie's case, but it doesn't necessarily help Madonna's. To the extent that Mr. Ritchie is responsible for Rocco's truancy, it reflects poorly on him as a parent.  The judge has mentioned that a lawyer will be appointed for Rocco, so I would suspect that that appointment has already been made or will be made sufficiently in advance of this Feb. 3 court appearance so that when the court appearance occurs, the judge can look at Rocco's lawyer and say:  What does your client think and why?   He  2013 the lawyer for Rocco  2013 is there to advocate for Rocco's desires, so the lawyer is not some sort of a neutral who sprinkles the fairy dust of the child's best interest on the proceedings. And so to the extent that Rocco's interests are adverse to one of his parents, that's why he gets his own lawyer because there's a conflict of interest otherwise. And so the judge will begin the process of trying to determine what is in Rocco's best interest.  Guy Ritchie and Madonna in 2008  As most children are when the parents become adverse to each other, the children know how to manipulate that for their own personal gain. Children are very adept to this, and the older they get, the more precocious they are, the more able they are to manipulate it, so his legal posture may be as a subordinate but as a practical matter and as a represented party of the proceedings, he's kind of got the keys to the car. And I think his voice will be heard and given some significant weight and that is after there has been some level of inquiry as to the motivation for his position.  If he says,  I want to be with Daddy,  and that's because it turns out that Daddy is a Good Time Charlie while Mommy makes him go to bed all the time or makes sure he does his homework, the bonafides of the child's expressed preferences may be questioned, and the kid may not get what he wants. If it becomes more along the lines of a kid saying,  Listen, I relate more to my dad; his interests are more like mine; he understands my issues with dating or with my friends or stuff like that and mom just doesn't  ... Depending on how sophisticated the child is in voicing his concerns, his voice will be given a lot of weight.  His court-appointed attorney would just speak for him. It would be very unusual for a child to testify. I don't know if Rocco will be personally present in the proceeding, ordinarily the child, even though he's represented, would not be in open court. He might be available to his lawyer by the phone somewhere, but there's no need to have the child because, again, the disputes between parents are between the parents. It's a matter for his parents to sort out: He's more than a bystander, but he's not a full-blown party.  It's not going to go on past Rocco's 18th birthday  2013 we know that. And I don't imagine the judge would let this drag on because it's so contrary to the lives of all three of the people involved, and there are siblings and stuff, so it's kind of misery. So I would suspect [the judge] will find a way to put an end to this feud reasonably soon. Summary: The exes are due in court for a second hearing in New York on Feb. 3",

He set the next meeting for 17 March. 00c2 Both delegations, which made their diametrically opposed ambitions clear before they came to Vienna, presented their positions for several hours on issues of how much power should be devolved locally in health care, education and police to municipalities, especially to areas where Serbs form a majority.  Rohan said the talks were not aimed at reaching a specific agreement but rather to listening to both sides and trying to find common ground on issues not directly linked to Kosovo's status.   We want to identify the maximum of common ground, of partial agreements, all this knowing that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed,  Rohan said.  Leon Kojen, a Serb delegate, said the talks were  useful  but that the two sides remained opposed on Kosovo's future status.

Mass graves unearthed in Kosovobear testimony to ethnic hatred  Lutfi Haziri, the head of the Kosovo delegation, said the province should become independent  as soon as possible. If it is possible tomorrow, we would be happy , he said. 00c2 Rohan said UN mediators were tackling practical issues in the hope of reaching a final agreement by the end of 2006.   Discussions on status could have ended in two hours,  Rohan said. 00c2 Ethnic Albanians, who comprise about 90% of the province's population of two million, want independence.  Serbia insists on retaining some control over the region, which it considers an integral part of the nation and the birthplace of its national identity centuries ago.  The UN has administered the province since 1999, after Nato launched air attacks to stop a crackdown on independence-minded ethnic Albanians by Slobodan Milosevic's Serb forces.

We want to identify the maximum of common ground, of partial agreements, all this knowing that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed Albert Rohan,UN's deputy envoy  Rohan conceded that it might take a generation to bring the two sides to live together in harmony after the bloodshed of the 1990s. For now the best hope for them is if they cohabit, Rohan said.  The overall process is being mediated by Martti Ahtisaari, the 00c2 former Finnish president.  Diplomats from the so-called Contact Group - the US, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Russia - have already agreed on a set of guidelines for Kosovo's future. 00c2 Status stipulations  Those rules say the province cannot return to its previous status under direct Serb rule, nor can it be partitioned along ethnic lines or be joined to another country in the region, such as Albania.  They also stipulate that any agreement should be acceptable to the province's ethnic Albanians.  The two sides have disagreed over how much power should be held locally, with the province's minority Serbs insisting they be allowed to run affairs in their communities, link up with other Serb areas and have special ties to Belgrade. 00c2 Kosovo's ethnic Albanians say such a solution is a recipe for ethnic partition.

It said the category two cyclone, with wind gusts of up to 130 kilometres an hour, was gathering strength, prompting extreme weather warnings across the nation.  Heavy rain from the weather system has already caused flash flooding on Viti Levu, with police confirming a 70-year-man had been killed and a 13-year old girl was missing after swollen rivers burst their banks.

Maduro blames  201cforeign threats, 201d the U.S., and  201cthe bourgeoisie 201d for Venezuela 2019s troubles. But the real problem is low oil prices in a market-hostile, centrally directed economy. Like most dictators, Maduro is doubling down rather than unshackling the forces that could stop the disaster. Analysts wonder how much longer he 2019ll stay in power.  -A raft of Chinese economic statistics over the weekend came in below expectations and below last year 2019s results. President Xi Jinping and other top leaders, whose instinct is to make things happen rather than let things happen, are apparently divided over what to do. Articles in the official People 2019s Daily last week featured Xi and an unnamed  201cauthoritative person 201d criticizing China 2019s current policy of monetary and fiscal stimulus. But if there 2019s disarray at the top, there 2019s also agreement on at least one policy: intimidating researchers, stock brokers, and journalists into reporting only upbeat economic news by threatening them with prison or fines for doing otherwise. This also is classic. Dictators may be the only ones who don 2019t realize that squelching accurate information makes the problem worse, not better.  -And yes, a system of all-powerful rulers can give way gracefully to democracy over time. Exhibit A will be on view Wednesday, when Queen Elizabeth II opens Parliament. She will enter the House of Lords chamber, and an official will be sent to the House of Commons chamber, where the door will be slammed in his face, a reminder that since 1642 the monarch has been barred from entering the Commons while it 2019s meeting. The members will eventually walk down to the Lords to hear Her Majesty read the Queen 2019s Speech. But she only reads it; the government writes it. The people have all the power, the monarch virtually none. But she 2019s still called the queen, and the people love her.  Of course you 2019re not a dictator. But business leaders who are perceived by their followers to be gathering power to themselves, or blaming implausible sinister forces for problems, or punishing unwelcome accurate news in favor of happy talk, are heading down a well-worn path that leads nowhere good. Summary: Despite its remarkably poor record, dictatorship has staying power in politics and business.",

            "input": "text:Over the last year this newspaper has shone the bright light of hindsight on decisions that led the United States into Iraq. We have examined the failings of American and allied intelligence, especially on the issue of Iraq's weapons and possible Iraqi connections to international terrorists. We have studied the allegations of official gullibility and hype. It is past time we turned the same light on ourselves.  In doing so -- reviewing hundreds of articles written during the prelude to war and into the early stages of the occupation -- we found an enormous amount of journalism that we are proud of. In most cases, what we reported was an accurate reflection of the state of our knowledge at the time, much of it painstakingly extracted from intelligence agencies that were themselves dependent on sketchy information. And where those articles included incomplete information or pointed in a wrong direction, they were later overtaken by more and stronger information. That is how news coverage normally unfolds.  But we have found a number of instances of coverage that was not as rigorous as it should have been. In some cases, information that was controversial then, and seems questionable now, was insufficiently qualified or allowed to stand unchallenged. Looking back, we wish we had been more aggressive in re-examining the claims as new evidence emerged -- or failed to emerge.  The problematic articles varied in authorship and subject matter, but many shared a common feature. They depended at least in part on information from a circle of Iraqi informants, defectors and exiles bent on ''regime change'' in Iraq, people whose credibility has come under increasing public debate in recent weeks. (The most prominent of the anti-Saddam campaigners, Ahmad Chalabi, has been named as an occasional source in Times articles since at least 1991, and has introduced reporters to other exiles. He became a favorite of hard-liners within the Bush administration and a paid broker of information from Iraqi exiles, until his payments were cut off last week.) Complicating matters for journalists, the accounts of these exiles were often eagerly confirmed by United States officials convinced of the need to intervene in Iraq. Administration officials now acknowledge that they sometimes fell for misinformation from these exile sources. So did many news organizations -- in particular, this one.  Some critics of our coverage during that time have focused blame on individual reporters. Our examination, however, indicates that the problem was more complicated. Editors at several levels who should have been challenging reporters and pressing for more skepticism were perhaps too intent on rushing scoops into the paper. Accounts of Iraqi defectors were not always weighed against their strong desire to have Saddam Hussein ousted. Articles based on dire claims about Iraq tended to get prominent display, while follow-up articles that called the original ones into question were sometimes buried. In some cases, there was no follow-up at all.  On Oct. 26 and Nov. 8,2001, for example, Page 1 articles cited Iraqi defectors who described a secret Iraqi camp where Islamic terrorists were trained and biological weapons produced. These accounts have never been independently verified.  On Dec. 20,2001, another front-page article began, ''An Iraqi defector who described himself as a civil engineer said he personally worked on renovations of secret facilities for biological, chemical and nuclear weapons in underground wells, private villas and under the Saddam Hussein Hospital in Baghdad as recently as a year ago.'' Knight Ridder Newspapers reported last week that American officials took that defector -- his name is Adnan Ihsan Saeed al-Haideri -- to Iraq earlier this year to point out the sites where he claimed to have worked, and that the officials failed to find evidence of their use for weapons programs. It is still possible that chemical or biological weapons will be unearthed in Iraq, but in this case it looks as if we, along with the administration, were taken in. And until now we have not reported that to our readers. Summary: New York Times editors say review of hundreds of articles written during prelude to war in Iraq and into early stages of occupation found much solid journalism and number of cases in which controversial data was insufficiently qualified or allowed to stand unchallenged; note many problematic articles depended in part on data from circle of Iraqi informants, defectors and exiles bent on 'regime change,' whose credibility has come under increasing public debate; hold exile accounts were often eagerly confirmed by United States officials convinced of need to invade Iraq; say editors at several levels share responsibility with reporters; cite specific articles (M)",

            "input": "text:As a child, Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos spent his summers fixing windmills and repairing equipment on his grandparents 2019 ranch in Texas. Though these experiences might have seemed insignificant at the time, today Bezos credits his summers tinkering with ranch equipment for his penchant for experimentation. And it 2019s his drive to push the boundaries of what 2019s possible that have helped Amazon AMZN gain  2014 and maintain  2014 its reign as the largest and most successful Internet retail company in the world.  Last month 2019s New York Times feature on Amazon 2019s culture  2014 and the ensuing media frenzy  2014 has raised many critical questions about the price people pay when working for a company committed to perpetual reinvention. While I don 2019t have deep inside knowledge about the average working experience at Amazon (and it 2019s most likely somewhere in between the worst and best case scenarios), I have occasionally crossed paths with Bezos through my research for The Innovator 2019s DNA (co-authored with Jeff Dyer at BYU and Clayton Christensen at Harvard Business School). I believe that Bezos 2019 start-up story offers one of the strongest cases for how to build a new or better business through experimentation.  In our research interviews for The Innovator 2019s DNA, we asked Bezos about the crucial role experimentation plays at Amazon.  201cExperiments are key to innovation because they rarely turn out as you expect and you learn so much, 201d he told us.  201cWe 2019ve tried to reduce the cost of doing experiments so that we can do more of them. If you can increase the number of experiments you try from a hundred to a thousand, you dramatically increase the number of innovations you produce. 201d  Innovators like Bezos see the world as a laboratory. They continually seek to answer those  201cwhat-if 201d questions as they search for new solutions. Our research of other high-impact leaders shows that experimentation is the discovery skill that most commonly differentiates innovators from non-innovators. Becoming a master experimenter requires consciously approaching work and life with a hypothesis-testing mind-set. Here are three ways to do this:  Take on new, unique experiences  Discovery-driven leaders embrace new experiences as a means to engage in interactive learning. Bezos probably never expected that taking apart his grandfather 2019s Caterpillar tractor would lay the foundation for his disruptive thinking later in life. Similarly, the late Apple CEO Steve Jobs likely didn 2019t think taking a calligraphy class in college would provide the inspiration for the typography on Apple AAPL computers years later.  Diverse experiences allow for divergent thinking and increase the capacity for innovation. It 2019s important to approach new activities with an open mind. Try taking time out of your day to learn a new skill, like acting or photography. When you 2019re working with a variety of people, processes and products or solving new, complex problems, you 2019ll see a big boost in creative thinking and you 2019ll gain new perspectives on the world around you.  Deconstruct products, processes and ideas  In 1994, before the Internet was truly valued, Bezos came across an article stating the Internet was growing 2,300% a year. Instead of shrugging the statistic off, he asked,  201cWhat kind of business opportunity might this new-fangled thing called the Internet represent? 201d Bezos deconstructed a traditional business process for delivering goods and  201cThe Earth 2019s Biggest Bookstore 201d was born. Just as Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his team took apart a brand new Mercedes Benz to better understand how it worked before building their own, experimenters seize opportunities to learn more about the world (and items) around them.  You may not have a brand new car that you 2019re willing to part with, but there may be items laying around your house or at a local market that no longer work. They offer opportunities for learning something you 2019ve always been interested in but have never taken the time to explore. In the process of taking things apart, you 2019ll inevitably ask questions and trigger new ideas for how to make things work better.  Focus on process, not failure  Experimenting is the ultimate way to transform an idea into reality  2013 it 2019s the mechanism by which great new insights translate into new markets. When Amazon became profitable beyond bookselling, Bezos made a risky bet to build a number of large warehouses throughout the country, a decision which initially sank stock prices but later helped the company become the leading online discount store.  True innovators have an experiential approach to business and go out of their way to enable others to do the same. They understand testing new ideas will rarely bring instant success, but see each experiment as an opportunity to gather data to improve for the next time. In fact, the value of experimenting most often comes through the process.  201cThe only way to know how a complex system will behave  2014 after you modify it  2014 is to modify it and see how it behaves, 201d said George Box, former president of the American Statistical Association. Do the same by reinforcing the power of the experimental process, instead of obsessing over instant outcomes. Embed  201ctry and learn 201d as the operating mantra of your own organization.  Innovators must have the courage to fail and learn from failures. So whether you 2019re reconstructing a product like Bezos did on his grandfather 2019s farm, or testing a new idea after getting a little inspiration at work, remember that it is the spirit and action of experimentation that can lead you to unexpected places and great new ideas. The more experiments you conduct, the closer you 2019ll get to powerful, positive results.

Drone sales are expected to grow from 2.5 million this year to 7 million in 2020, according to report released this week by the Federal Aviation Administration.  Hobbyist sales will more than double from 1.9 million drones in 2016 to 4.3 million in 2020, the agency said. Meanwhile, business sales will triple over the period from 600,000 to 2.7 million.

The FAA believes that 2017 will be the big turning point in drone adoption by businesses, which use them for everything from scanning power lines to inspecting rooftops for insurance companies. Commercial sales are expected to reach 2.5 million, after which sales will increase only slightly for the next few years.  Currently, companies must obtain FAA certification to fly drones for business purposes. Some businesses and drone lobbying groups have grumbled that the regulation is partly to blame for preventing the drone industry from taking off in the United States.  New rules are in the works that are aimed at streamlining the process for businesses. They are expected to be completed by the later this Spring, the FAA report said.  As of March, the FAA has granted over 3,000 drone-related certifications to businesses.

The couple, whose names have not been released, were pressured from extended family members who noticed the children did not look alike, Le Dinh Luong, president of the Genetic Association of Vietnam  According to the news outlet, one child has thick and wavy hair and the other has thin and straight hair.  While this is reportedly the first case of bi-paternal twins in Vietnam, a woman in New Jersey had the same revelation in May 2015.  When the mother was in the process of applying for benefits from the man she claimed was the father of the babies, a paternity test was ordered after she revealed that she had sex with another man that same week,  Results from the test revealed that he was the father  2013 but only for one of the twins.  While it's rare, Dr. Keith Eddleman, director of obstetrics at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York told CNN that it's definitely possible.  A woman's egg has a life span of 12 to 48 hours, and a sperm is viable for seven to 10 days.

            "input": "text:Chang W. Lee The New York Times   Back then, we believed the party was great and graceful and correct, and you were obedient to the party. NIE YUANZI  A four-hour television series and interactive web site by The Times, The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the ZDF network of Germany.  Hans Rudolf Oeser for The New York Times   I was transported to the time the Nazis took power. WANG RONGFEN  NIE YUANZI was an ambitious college professor whose  big character poster,  displayed on the grounds of Beijing University, was said to have ignited the Cultural Revolution, a prairie fire of violent purges and denunciations that quickly spread across the nation.  Wang Rongfen was a student of German at Beijing's elite Foreign Language Institute who was imprisoned after writing a bold letter to Mao challenging his judgment in unleashing the self-destructive frenzy of his young vigilantes, the Red Guards.  Even today, the history of that time has been shunted into a dark corner. There have been no news reports or public memorials of the catastrophe, in which hundreds of thousands of people were killed and China's economy was devastated. Yet four decades after the start of the Cultural Revolution in May 1966, there remains a compelling symmetry to the experiences and reflections of the two women who played such prominent roles at the outset of this disastrous era, and had their lives tragically derailed as a result.  However different, they were both, in the phrase of Ms. Wang,  bold and straightforward  women.  After the publication of an article criticizing Mao's political rivals, Ms. Nie, then Communist Party secretary of Beijing University's philosophy department, put up a poster that claimed the university was under the control of the bourgeoisie. Mao had the poster read over the radio, giving it his stamp of approval and encouraging attacks on authority figures.  Vaulted into the leadership of the Red Guard, she was detained only a year later after becoming disenchanted with its excesses, and was jailed for 17 years.  Now, she is an 85-year-old who survives on the charity of friends. Looking back, she insists that she had no idea that the poster she made would have such terrible consequences.  I didn't know we were heading toward disaster,  she said, describing herself as a party loyalist who executed orders.  Once I understood, I stopped following them. I opposed them, and for that I was punished.   Ms. Wang, then 20, was selected to attend one of the earliest mass rallies of the period at Tiananmen Square, when the Maoist personality cult was being whipped into a frenzy.  The speeches she heard there reminded her of the language of the Third Reich, and she watched, horrified, over the ensuing weeks as teachers committed suicide, students denounced one another and her own mother was assigned to forced labor.  I was transported to the time the Nazis took power,  she said.  Ms. Wang gathered her courage to write a fateful document of her own, a signed letter to Chairman Mao asking:  What are you doing? Where are you leading China?  It concluded with a judgment that the country's leaders shy from even now.  The Cultural Revolution is not a mass movement,  she wrote.  It is one man with a gun manipulating the people.   The letter, which has never been published, earned her a life sentence, which was lifted after 12 00bd years, following Mao's death in 1976, which also spelled the end of the Cultural Revolution.  THOUGH frail, Ms. Nie remains feisty. She recently published a book in Hong Kong about her experiences. She greets visitors with a bright red business card that bears her portrait. And she takes calls on a tiny cellphone every few minutes during days spent at her writing desk.   The lessons,  she said, when asked what she drew from her experience.  Democracy should be really promoted so that each person can express their opinions about state affairs and the work of others. Even if an opinion is not correct, it must be allowed, and allowed to be contradicted. Even today, posters should be allowed.   Ms. Nie readily acknowledges helping to visit suffering on others, like officials of Beijing University, the target of her poster. They were paraded around the grounds of the university in a dunce cap and signboard. Others, labeled reactionaries, were beaten or tortured by the Red Guards.  The greater culprit, now as then, she said, is the country's system.  Back then, we believed the party was great and graceful and correct, and you were obedient to the party,  she said.  You went wherever it pointed you.   Once the chaos set in, though, Ms. Nie came to regret her role. At a meeting of party leaders in August 1967, she tried to quit the leadership of the Red Guard, but was refused by Mao's powerful wife, Jiang Qing. A few months later, she helped avert a gun battle at the university between rival groups and was arrested soon afterward. Summary: Four decades after the start of the Cultural Revolution, there remains a compelling symmetry to the experiences and reflections of Nie Yuanzi and Wang Rongfen.",

            "input": "text:IN 1984, Isabele Carmichael of New York, a top road racer, qualified for the first Olympic marathon trial for women. Later that year she developed recurring tightness in her right leg that caused her foot to grow numb. Forced to cut her high-level training to mere jogging, she desperately sought a medical solution to her problem.  ''I saw a lot of different doctors, including one who gave me injections in the lower back,'' Carmichael said. ''Nothing helped.''  It was not until this past summer that Carmichael, 38 years old, began to find relief. Dr. Garry Sherman, an Englewood, N.J., podiatrist who has treated other runners successfully, found that Carmichael had a leg-length discrepancy - her left leg is about a half-inch shorter than her right - and prescribed orthotic inserts to be placed in her shoes.  Carmichael wears the inserts not only while running but at all other times as well. ''I would not be comfortable running without them,'' she said. ''The symptoms have diminished. They are less intense and they appear less often.''  While Carmichael's recovery is far from complete, she is yet another example of a runner frustrated by pain who seems to have been ''saved'' by orthotics. What was once a hit or miss art practiced by a handful of specialists, orthotics use is standard practice in podiatric sports medicine. Its design and application are being refined by increasingly sophisticated methods, including computer technology.  In evaluating Carmichael, Sherman used electrodynography, in which sensors are placed on the foot, a microprocessor is attached to the back and information is fed into a computer. The resulting data provided a biomechanical profile of Carmichael to be considered in treatment. This process has been called an E.K.G. of the foot.  With orthotics, says Sherman, the doctor errs if he deals exclusively with the foot. ''The whole body must be taken into account,'' he said. ''The hips, the back. All systems are interrelated.''  This recognition has led to some fancy footwork on the part of researchers and orthotics specialists. Peter R. Cavanagh, Ph.D., director of the Center for Locomotion Studies at Penn State University, recently opened a running injury clinic at which high-speed film of patients and other instruments pinpoint the subtleties of running form. ''The computer measurements reduce the modifications in orthotics, bringing us closer to perfection faster,'' Cavanagh said.  Most doctors rely on outside labs to make orthotics. The doctor will send the lab a cast of the runner's feet, along with specifications based on an examination and the nature of the injury. Orthotics are made of leather, fiberglass, polypropylene, graphite and other substances and weigh only a couple of ounces.  Doctors have found that a variety of ailments, from runner's knee to shin splints, can be treated effectively with orthotics. These so-called foot appliances correct biomechanical weakness that causes pain under the stress of running. For example, an orthotic will prevent a high-arched foot from flattening, resulting in knee strain.  While some runners do experience immediate success, ''orthotics do not perform miracles,'' said Dr. Justin Wernick, a podiatrist and co-founder of Langer Biomechanics in Deer Park, L.I., the nation's largest orthotics supplier. ''The runner has to give it time, and accept some responsibility.''  Wernick says running shoes must have heel counters that are deep enough and strong enough to accommodate an orthotic. Matching the shoe to the orthotic is as critical as the orthotic itself, and runners sometimes end up switching from preferred brands.  What's left of the guesswork in orthotics may be further reduced by a new computer scanner developed by Dr. John Bergman, a Northfield, Ill., podiatrist, and the Ammon Corporation of Mesa, Ariz. The scanner, says Bergman, produces a topographical image of the foot and allows for more precise construction and fine-tuning. Also, instead of the traditional plaster cast, Bergman uses a wax cast which, he said, permits greater variety in the use of materials.  These bells and whistles come at no extra cost, insists Bergman. The steep price of orthotics has kept runners on guard, however. Langer and Bergman declined to say what they charge doctors but, according to Dr. Paul Taylor, of Silver Spring, Md., president of the American Academy of Podiatric Sports Medicine, lab fees range from $60 to more than $100. For an initial visit, casting, the orthotics and follow-up work, the cost to the runner-patient can come to several hundred dollars.  Is it worth it? ''Definitely,'' said Taylor, who pays fees in the $200 to $300 range. ''For many patients, surgery or cessation of activity are the alternatives. We have found 90 percent success in restoring runners to full activity.''  Many leading sports podiatrists are former students of Dr. Richard Schuster, professor emeritus of biomechanics at the New York College of Podiatric Medicine. In the 1970's, Schuster pioneered the use of orthotics for running injuries, making orthotics like an old world cobbler in a garage in College Point, Queens. He remains the conscience of the industry.  Currently based in Merritt Island, Fla., Schuster questions high-tech methods that remove the human touch. ''I would never make orthotics without looking at the worn shoes of a runner,'' he said.  One Manhattan podiatrist who uses Schuster's orthotics, among others, and claims an 80 percent success rate, is Dr. Murray Weisenfeld, author of ''The Runner's Repair Manual.'' He says runners used to consider orthotics to be a status symbol but have outgrown that.  Even so, a runner and his orthotics are rarely apart. Like Greg Louganis and his teddy bear. Dr. Richard Schuster on Running and Orthotics The type of pain that begins after about a mile or so can almost certainly be cured by orthotics.  While pain may strike in the leg, knee or hip, typically it emanates from a structural imbalance in the foot.  Vulnerable runners tend to develop pain when their training reaches 30 to 35 miles a week.  Properly made orthotics extend to the forefoot, as opposed to ending before the ball of the foot.  Orthotics must be flexible but not compress under the weight of a runner's foot.  The edges of orthotics must be smooth so as not to irritate the foot, causing further damage.  Running shoes must provide a stable foundation for orthotics.  Shoes should be shaped like a runner's functioning foot; avoid models that are severely curved at the arch.  Generally, remove the insole before putting orthotics in your shoes.  Orthotics use should be one remedy among many to promote pain-free running. Others include: change in running shoes, stretching exercises, reduction in running intensity, change in running surface, avoidance of hills.

            "input": "text:Some photos go viral. Others are chronic. Such images not only spread rapidly through the bloodstream of social media like an acute infection, they crop up again and again in the popular imagination after lying dormant for months or even years. This is the case with a photo whose recurring poignancy flared up again last week, having done so unpredictably ever since it was first captured nearly a decade ago. The raw message that the image communicates is one of archetypal sadness: an elderly retired soldier knuckling away tears from his eye as he marches, alone, down a doleful street in a municipal parade.  Clocking up over a million likes on Facebook, the photo by Alexander Petrosyan has resonated globally in spite of the fact (or, more likely, because) the precise identity of the man, his nationality and allegiances, were unknown, if not unknowable. Untethered to the prejudices of time and place  2013 to the biases of victory or defeat  2013 the man 2019s grief-stricken countenance has propelled itself to the level of symbol, perennially resurfacing as a universal emblem of human heartache.  But will the photo continue to have such power? Recent investigations into the origin of the image have managed to pin down the decorated soldier 2019s location to St Petersburg in 2007 and to a parade celebrating the defeat of Nazi Germany. More photos have emerged of the veteran receiving flowers and the photographer has recounted that the unidentified man  201cwas upset that he was behind the column with other veterans and could not catch up with them 201d.  Whether widespread knowledge of such specificity will rupture the image 2019s sweeping appeal remains to be seen. How, one wonders, might the image look if it were stripped utterly of its worldly signifiers  2013 the military medals pinned to the soldier 2019s chest, the swoosh of the Nike logo emblazoned on his windbreaker, and the flags fastened to the streetlamp behind him  2013 leaving behind nothing more than the irreducible contours of his deep interior suffering?  What would such an isolation of sadness look like? It would look like Vincent Van Gogh 2019s affecting portrait Sorrowing Old Man (At Eternity 2019s Gate). More so than other notable depictions of tearful subjects (from Il Guercino 2019s St Peter Weeping Before the Virgin (1647) to Picasso 2019s serially weeping women), Van Gogh 2019s painting resists the burden of religious and stylistic encroachment.  Painted just two months before the troubled artist 2019s death in July 1890, the portrayal of a mournful old man wringing his eyes in intolerable despair finds Van Gogh returning to a subject he 2019d first approached eight years earlier as a drawing entitled Worn Out. Like the photo circulating in social media last week, Sorrowing Old Man captures the unguarded moment when an anonymous soldier is overcome with emotion (the artist 2019s model was the Dutch war veteran Adrianus Jacobus Zuyderland).  Undertaken while Van Gogh was recuperating in an asylum to which he 2019d committed himself in spring 1890, Sorrowing Old Man is not just autobiographical in its encapsulation of the artist 2019s own tormented state. It offers itself as an universal emblem of sadness  2013 a lonely tune to which all of us have found ourselves marching.  100 Works of Art That Will Define Our Age by Kelly Grovier is published by Thames & Hudson.

            "input": "text:George W. Bush has quipped several times during his political career that it would be so much easier to govern in a dictatorship. Apparently he never told his vice president that this was a joke.  Virtually from the time he chose himself to be Mr. Bush's running mate in 2000, Dick Cheney has spearheaded an extraordinary expansion of the powers of the presidency -- from writing energy policy behind closed doors with oil executives to abrogating longstanding treaties and using the 9 11 attacks as a pretext to invade Iraq, scrap the Geneva Conventions and spy on American citizens.  It was a chance Mr. Cheney seems to have been dreaming about for decades. Most Americans looked at wrenching events like the Vietnam War, the Watergate scandal and the Iran-contra debacle and worried that the presidency had become too powerful, secretive and dismissive. Mr. Cheney looked at the same events and fretted that the presidency was not powerful enough, and too vulnerable to inspection and calls for accountability.  The president  needs to have his constitutional powers unimpaired, if you will, in terms of the conduct of national security policy,  Mr. Cheney said this week as he tried to stifle the outcry over a domestic spying program that Mr. Bush authorized after the 9 11 attacks.  Before 9 11, Mr. Cheney was trying to undermine the institutional and legal structure of multilateral foreign policy: he championed the abrogation of the Antiballistic Missile Treaty with Moscow in order to build an antimissile shield that doesn't work but makes military contactors rich. Early in his tenure, Mr. Cheney, who quit as chief executive of Halliburton to run with Mr. Bush in 2000, gathered his energy industry cronies at secret meetings in Washington to rewrite energy policy to their specifications. Mr. Cheney offered the usual excuses about the need to get candid advice on important matters, and the courts, sadly, bought it. But the task force was not an exercise in diverse views. Mr. Cheney gathered people who agreed with him, and allowed them to write national policy for an industry in which he had recently amassed a fortune.  The effort to expand presidential power accelerated after 9 11, taking advantage of a national consensus that the president should have additional powers to use judiciously against terrorists.  Mr. Cheney started agitating for an attack on Iraq immediately, pushing the intelligence community to come up with evidence about a link between Iraq and Al Qaeda that never existed. His team was central to writing the legal briefs justifying the abuse and torture of prisoners, the idea that the president can designate people to be  unlawful enemy combatants  and detain them indefinitely, and a secret program allowing the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on American citizens without warrants. And when Senator John McCain introduced a measure to reinstate the rule of law at American military prisons, Mr. Cheney not only led the effort to stop the amendment, but also tried to revise it to actually legalize torture at C.I.A. prisons.  There are finally signs that the democratic system is trying to rein in the imperial presidency. Republicans in the Senate and House forced Mr. Bush to back the McCain amendment, and Mr. Cheney's plan to legalize torture by intelligence agents was rebuffed. Congress also agreed to extend the Patriot Act for five weeks rather than doing the administration's bidding and rushing to make it permanent.  On Wednesday, a federal appeals court refused to allow the administration to transfer Jose Padilla, an American citizen who has been held by the military for more than three years on suspicion of plotting terrorist attacks, from military to civilian custody. After winning the same court's approval in September to hold Mr. Padilla as an unlawful combatant, the administration abruptly reversed course in November and charged him with civil crimes unrelated to his arrest. That decision was an obvious attempt to avoid having the Supreme Court review the legality of the detention powers that Mr. Bush gave himself, and the appeals judges refused to go along.  Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney have insisted that the secret eavesdropping program is legal, but The Washington Post reported yesterday that the court created to supervise this sort of activity is not so sure. It said that the presiding judge was arranging a classified briefing for her fellow judges and that several judges on the court wanted to know why the administration believed eavesdropping on American citizens without warrants was legal when the law specifically required such warrants.  Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney are tenacious. They still control both houses of Congress and are determined to pack the judiciary with like-minded ideologues. Still, the recent developments are encouraging, especially since the court ruling on Mr. Padilla was written by a staunch conservative considered by President Bush for the Supreme Court. Summary: Editorial on Vice Pres Dick Cheney's efforts to expand presidential powers since he and Pres Bush came into office; cites using 9 11 attacks as pretext to invade Iraq, scrap Geneva Conventions, spy on American citizens and other issues; praises signs that Congress is finally taking independent stance, thwarting efforts to legalize torture by intelligence agents and forcing Bush to back McCain anti-torture amendment; also notes federal court decision rebuking administration for trying to transfer Jose Padilla from military to civilian custody; warns that Bush and Cheney still control Congress and are determined to pack judiciary with like-minded ideologues",

Moobella raised another $18 million in venture funding in September.  See the Moobella video here.  Emo Labs, Waltham, Mass. Emo figured out a way to embed .02-inch-thick-speakers into the edges of televisions and computer screens. Instead of the cones, magnets and voice coils that move sound through traditional speakers, the speakers create sound using small movements and a voltage. The company is still securing partnerships with manufacturers. Target date in stores: end of 2010.  See the Emo Labs video here.  Activeion, Rogers, Minn. Faced with the holiday-party aftermath and out of cleaning fluids? Just fill up a bottle with plain old tap water and spray it on the stain. When you press the trigger, Activeion 0092s bottles move tap water through a small electrical charge that separates the molecules into positive and negative charges and creates bubbles. This bubbly water lifts dirt and bacteria from any surface like a magnet, making it easy to wipe away dirt and grease. Originally aimed at professional cleaning companies, Activeion recently released a home version, retailing for $169 for a 12-oz. bottle.  See the Activeion video here.  IdeaPaint, Cambridge, Mass. Want to spur innovation? Turn every wall, no matter the surface, into a whiteboard. Three recent Babson College graduates created a paint that dries to create a surface that does just that, and any dry-erase marker wipes it completely clean. The paint sells for $3.50 to $4.00 per square foot of coating. After closing a $5 million venture round in December 2009 (following a $5 million round in November 2008), the founders plan to have it in at least one big-box store in early 2010.

            "input": "text:Q. My teen son has been playing soccer since he was 6, and he 2019s become pretty good, making the high school team. But he wasn 2019t a starter last fall, and now he 2019s talking about quitting. Meanwhile, his little sister is deep into gymnastics and swimming, and she 2019s talking about giving up piano. I feel like if I let them walk away, they 2019ll regret it later. What do you think?  JEFF: It sure can bring out the despot in a parent when a kid wants to quit, right? The only time I feel justified in my authoritarian tendencies, though, is when my children try to weasel out of their household duties. ( 201cNo, Rebecca, you can 2019t quit setting the table when it 2019s your night . . . if you want to eat dinner! 201d) But when we 2019re talking extracurricular activities, not chores, I try to resist putting my foot down. I 2019ll feel better about myself afterward if I take a step back and look at the big picture. And breathe.  How much is going on in the child 2019s life? Is homework eating up her free time? Is the activity he wants to quit the only one of its kind in his weekly routine? I 2019d be less bothered if the questioner 2019s daughter wanted to drop either gymnastics or swimming, because they 2019re both physical activities. My wife and I like our kids to maintain some balance of exercise and arts. So if the girl no longer wants to play piano, might she prefer picking up another instrument rather than letting the music die?  When my son tired of classical violin, for instance, we got another year out of him by switching to fiddle lessons. Eventually he went,  201cHey, wait a second, 201d but even then we just persuaded him to move on to a different section of the orchestra. Now he 2019s a trumpeter, he 2019s loving it, and my wife and I are thrilled he still has music in his life. (The neighbors? They 2019re adjusting.)  KATHY: Oh, how I 2019ve fiddled around on the subject of quitting! At first, when my kids quit something, it made me uncomfortable, because am I not supposed to teach them perseverance? My daughter really had quite the quits for a while  2014 short stints with basketball, softball, piano, and dance, which made my husband and I fret she had an inherent lack of stick-to-it-tivenesss.  We had firm rules here: We never let her quit before the season was over (since that was letting down her teammates) and we insisted she had to do an after-school activity. We also considered the big picture? She wasn 2019t a  201cquitter 201d by nature; she 2019s a stickler on grades and homework, for instance.  Finally, when she turned 11, she found her passion  2014 acting and improv  2014 and I realized that  201cquitting 201d hadn 2019t been the right lens. It was more like she was trying on clothing until she found the right fit. I 2019ll get to the questioner 2019s son (hey, we all gotta ride the bench). But as to the daughter, might she be telling you she 2019s tried on something and would like to put it back on the rack?  JEFF: Yeah, well, in the Life Lesson Boutique, our job is to be the salesperson helping our kid button the garment all the way. I mean, there 2019s trying on and there 2019s trying on. Activities don 2019t always seem like a perfect fit right away. Some need to be lived in for a while. Some require stretching  2014 but our kids usually can use a good stretch.  The parental sweet spot, I think, is somewhere between insisting that our kids take on an activity more stimulating than texting their friends, and insisting our kids take on an activity that stimulates us. I played soccer in college, and for years I pushed my kids into that sport over others. My wife the classical musician wasn 2019t too keen on folk guitar lessons. But gradually, reluctantly, we 2019ve let go of the puppet strings, and by some miracle these young humans we carved out of wood are standing on their own.  And doing stuff they love. And they don 2019t want to quit.  KATHY: Aren 2019t we such good therapists Jeff? Such eager empathizers, such vital validaters. But no more Mr. Nice Guy: I 2019m hard-core that the questioner 2019s son should not quit the soccer team. It 2019s a matter of nearing adulthood, really. Once you get to high school, it 2019s an honor to be chosen for the team, because so many kids don 2019t make it. You make it  2014 then you make the best of it.  Maybe the obstacle is a lack of imagination, so I 2019d spell out all the potential scenarios here. He works hard and becomes a starter. Or he shines when he 2019s subbed in. Or a spot opens up if another player has a slump, gets injured, or graduates.  But quit now, and you quit these opportunities. Brett Favre threw all of four passes in his first season in the NFL. Lou Gehrig batted only 42 times his first two years. In short, the world is full of great athletes who warmed the bench before they heated up the game. And so, young soccer player, I say that the only thing you should quit (and I mean this in the nicest way) is your whining. Summary: Parenting advice from Katharine Whittemore and Jeff Wagenheim.",

            "input": "text:Given the famous footprint that Milan will occupy, you wonder whether thought was given to naming the place after the site's previous occupant. As it turns out, that idea briefly crossed the mind of Victor Elmaleh, chairman of World Wide Holdings, the company that is developing Milan.  We considered it,  said Mr. Elmaleh, who by coincidence is of Moroccan but not Arab birth.  But remember the climate when we started two years ago. We did not want any connection to terrorism, and Morocco was constantly mentioned in connection with 9 11.   The name may be gone, and perhaps soon the zebra stripes on the pavement, but one artifact that will help keep alive the memory of El Morocco is an extraordinary book, a rare, privately published album of vintage photographs. The book,  El Morocco Family Album,  was published by Mr. Perona as a gift for El Morocco regulars. It was acquired by Lisa Linden, chief executive officer of Linden, Alschuler & Kaplan, the public relations firm that until recently represented Milan. Ms. Linden bought the album this year from David Cohen, a rare books dealer in Greenwich Village. She paid $1,000; other copies have been sold for thousands more.  The outsized, 62-page album, covered with now fading blue fabric, contained some 340 images by the great photographer Jerome Zerbe, who produced the signature images of the club. They are introduced by an ornate foreword by Lucius Beebe, the New York Herald Tribune columnist who documented cafe society in This New York and whose words have a witchy effect that can propel a susceptible reader back to the year of the book's private publication.   Given the entire antecedent social background of New York,  Beebe wrote,  it would still have been impossible to foresee the usurpation of the glitter scene of the most glittering city in the land by a single, and in itself, not overly resplendent hideaway in an entirely anonymous side street.   Ten years ago, no seer or prophet could have read in the conjunctions of the spheres the sudden and deafening explosion of Morocco. The New York scene was suddenly and in its social entirety taken over by people whose names made news.   Pictures of attractive people doing things like eating, drinking and giving each other a good goose supplanted the accustomed cabinet shots of debutantes who had either forgotten to put in their teeth or else were definitely giving the photographer the bird. Editors screamed in relief when there became available shots of young and fascinating people lapping up carboys of Champagne and dressed in the after dark attire of gentle-folk, and it at once became apparent that one way to become a professional celebrity was to be snapped by Mr. Zerbe. This book is a parade of People Who Count.   Beebe ends with an almost Thucydides-like conclusion:  They are true martyrs to magnums, the children of the night, and leaner and hungrier generations will look at their likeness in these pages with unthinkable envy.   Zerbe, who is thanked for not printing snapshots of beauties with  your eyes closed, your mouth open, and flies going in and out,  pointed out in an interview with Studs Terkel that he was one of the people who helped create the concept of celebrity; thanks to him, people began to go to El Morocco to be photographed.  And so we see stars like Ginger Rogers, Rosalind Russell and Loretta Young, but also the leading socialites, with quaint captions that would be sexist if they were not so antiquated:  Gary Cooper with his wife, who was socialite Barbara Balfe,  past tense being the proper form for a woman who had married.  Divorced couples were described as those who have  agreed to disagree,  and the album is captioned with unintentional howlers: The star of  Tarzan,  for example is identified as Johnny ( Ape-Man ) Weissmuller; a veiled woman with a terrier is  The Ranee of Sarawak, wife of the only white Rajah in India ; Mrs. Wanamaker Munn is shown with  her pet monkey, Chula, whose presence always caused considerable excitement.   A manic energy glows on the blue duotone pages, in part because El Morocco was more than a club; it was a motif for life. Regulars are shown sporting zebra scarves, zebra pins, toy stuffed zebras. One photo shows a zebra-striped banner announcing  Gone, Dammit!  unfurled from a cruise ship porthole, as a guest sailed away. Those who departed El Morocco are said to have  deserted ; how could they bear to go to India or Hollywood, and miss hearing Ethel Merman sing  Pennies From Heaven.   One More 'Touch of Venus'  A single fragile connection links the old El Morocco and the new Milan. Sono Osato, the wife of Mr. Elmaleh, is rumored to have dined at the club in its heyday, when she was a teenage star.  Ms. Osato,85, who is half Japanese, was one of the baby ballerinas who toured with Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in the 1930's; she describes those days in her 1980 memoir,  Distant Dances.  In the couple's apartment a few blocks from the new building, photographs and news clippings on the walls are reminders that she later performed on Broadway in  One Touch of Venus  and starred as the first Miss Turnstiles in the Comden and Green musical  On the Town.   Ms. Osato has aged into adorable no-nonsense. She is still petite, has a pixie haircut, and in her black leggings and T-shirt she is every tiny inch the dancer she once was. Her husband calls her  sweets.   The other day, flipping through the pages of the blue album, she remembered the night she was there. Once. On the arm of an older man.  Everyone looked fantastic against that zebra background,  she recalled.  The lighting was gorgeous.   She recalled another detail:  Brenda Frazier, the debutante of the year, was there that night, and she was wearing the largest aquamarine I have ever seen.   Her eye is drawn to photographs she is seeing for the first time.  Oh, there is Tamara,  one of the Russian ballerinas. And David Lichine, the half-Jewish, half-Cossack dancer. Her husband, too, is noting acquaintances.  Oh, Kitty Carlisle, she's 94 now, and dating.  Told that she and other divas of her generation had uttered a collective  Oh, dear!  at the news of the club's final demise, Mr. Elmaleh pointed out:  But, you know, the club was dead when we acquired it. It was already gutted.   The zebra banquettes and much of the memorabilia were purchased by the former tennis star Frank Hunter, a devotee of the club who recreated it in the basement of his Victorian mansion in Southampton on Long Island. The mansion's present owner, the designer Lisa Jackson, reported that  without dehumidifiers, the zebra rotted.  But, she added:  I saved what I could -- menus, pictures -- and have what remained in a shrine in my upstairs powder room.   Ms. Jackson also resolved the old debate as to whether the zebra stripes were black or dark blue.  Blue,  she confirmed, pointing out that the mansion is called Blue Haven.  They just photographed black.   And what of those last zebra swirls in the pavement? Will they be jackhammered into oblivion?  At V Studio, the Greenwich Village headquarters of Jay Valgora, who is designing Milan's lobby and residences, there are rumors of a stay of execution for remnants of the old club. According to Mr. Valgora, Mr. Elmaleh had a change of heart and now favors some salvage of El Morocco. The photos from the album have worked their witchy magic; Mr. Valgora now plans to mount the dreamy interior shot of patrons under the white palms as a backdrop mural for the lobby and display a montage of celebrities,  a parade from the past,  he calls it, on the hand-rubbed Venetian plaster wall.  And the zebra tiles? Mr. Valgora plans to transplant them to the garden.  The ghosts of El Morocco are not banished; the  animalique  power of the past drew one visitor to stand for a final moment on those famous tiles before they were uprooted. In the mind of this visitor, the music still plays, and Gershwin's lyrics echo in the shimmer of the city night.   The way we danced till three.   The way you changed my life,   No, no, they can't take that away from me.

Summary: Laura Shaine Cunningham article recalls El Morocco, chic New York City nightclub whose heyday began in 1930's, which is being demolished to make way for high-rise luxury condominium; some artifacts remain--zebra striped pavement outside club that condo designer Jay Valgora plans to transplant to garden, photos of patrons that will be mounted in lobby and El Morocco Family Album, rare, privately published album of vintage photos published by club owner John Perona as gift for El Morocco regulars; photos (L)",

The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said some of the retailers were inadequately represented in the litigation, which began in 2005. It also decertified the case as a class action.  A Visa spokeswoman said the company is reviewing the decision. MasterCard had no immediate comment.  Thursday 2019s decision upends an accord resolving claims that the card networks overcharged merchants on interchange fees, or swipe fees, when shoppers used credit or debit cards, and banned them from nudging customers toward cheaper means of payment.  The settlement had been the largest all-cash antitrust accord in U.S. history.  One class of merchants that accepted Visa or MasterCard from January 2004 to November 2012 was to share in up to $7.25 billion, while a second class accepting the cards from then on was to get injunctive relief in the form of rule changes.  But many retailers, including Amazon.com Inc and Target, objected, saying the accord, among other things, forced members of the second class to give up their right to sue over various policies and practices.  Writing for the appeals court, Circuit Judge Dennis Jacobs said the two classes should not have been represented by the same lawyers, who were awarded $544.8 million of fees.  He said the lawyers suffered from a  201cfundamental conflict, 201d having been in position to negotiate terms that could simultaneously benefit one class and harm the other.   201cWe have reason to think that that occurred here, 201d and in the end  201csapped class counsel of the incentive to zealously represent 201d the class obtaining injunctive relief, Jacobs said.

And yet, as the story made clear, the whole thing worked:  What sets Jaws apart from most of the other ceiling busters and makes it a special case, like The Godfather, is that it is quite a good movie. For one thing, it is mercifully free of the padding 2014cosmic, comic, cultural 2014that so often mars  201cbig 201d pictures. In that sense, the movie is very like its subject. If the great white shark that terrorizes the beaches of an island summer colony is one of nature 2019s most efficient killing machines, Jaws is an efficient entertainment machine.  Partly this is due to a shrewd adaptation. Peter Benchley 2019s novel spent too much time on dry land, plodding around Irving Wallace country, reinvestigating such tired phenomena as the uneasy marriage, the adulterous wife, the snaky seducer. In the movie, most of this lallygagging is eliminated. Police Chief Brody (Roy Scheider) must still fight the town 2019s mayor, who is fearful that closing the beaches after the first shark attacks will ruin his resort 2019s economy. He still joins forces with Quint, the professional shark killer (Robert Shaw, employing an ornate accent of indeterminate origin), and a youthful ichthyologist named Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), all theory and wisecracks. Scheider is occasionally too recessive for his own good, while Shaw is too excessive for the good of the film. Dreyfuss, however, is perfect. With a cheeky charm he manages to humanize the picture while stealing it.  Read the full story here in the TIME Vault: Summer of the Shark Summary: The movie was released on June 20, 1975",

Their research has shown that low doses of ordinary tea extracts reduced the cholesterol levels in rats while also reducing the levels of fatty acids in the animal's blood stream.  A study by scientists in Japan, which is published this month in the journal of Nutrition, reveals that extracts from tea leaves inhibits the absorption of fat in the gut of rats being fed high fat diets.  These rats also had less fat tissue on their bodies and lower fat content in their livers.  Dr Hiroaki Yajima, a scientist with the Kirin Beverage Company in Japan who carried out the Japanese research, said:  201cBlack tea extracts may prevent diet-induced obesity by inhibiting intestinal lipid absorption. 201d  The fermentation process used to make  black  tea leaves, the most commonly drunk type of tea in the UK, has also been found to boost levels of these fat-fighting compounds compared to green tea, which is unfermented.  The research suggests that despite more attention being paid to the health benefits of green tea, black tea may have greater health-boosting properties which are masked by the tendency to drink it with milk.  British researchers have also found that the type of milk used in a cup of tea can impact on the level of the  healthy  compounds.  Dr Lisa Ryan, a senior lecturer in human nutrition at the Functional Food Centre at Oxford Brookes University, has discovered that skimmed milk decreases the levels of these active compounds far more than whole or semi-skimmed milk.  Her team looked at five different brands of black tea sold in the UK, measuring the activity of antioxidant and polyphenol compounds after adding different types of milk.  She said:  The fat content of milk seems to be buffering the antioxidants and polyphenols. Molecules called caseins bind to the polyphenols and lead to a decrease in their availability for the body and in skimmed milk this happens more.   Although adding milk does impact on the availability of polyphenols, tea is still a significant source of them.  Summary: Drinking tea could help you lose weight, new research has found &ndash; but the effects are cancelled out if you add milk.",

Serena Slam For the second time this year, Serena Williams will be trying to tie Steffi Graf 2019s record for most career Grand Slams, at 22. (Williams lost to Angelique Kerber in the finals of the Australian Open). Williams has played in only four events in 2016: at the Italian Open last week, she secured her first tournament win in nine months by ousting fellow American Madison Keys in the final. Last year, a nasty flu almost kept Williams out of the French final: playing sick, she won her third French Open. Roland Garros, however, is the only Grand Slam event Williams has failed to win in back-to-back years. Can she pull it off at 34?

Since the start of 2015, the Serbian owns a 119-9 match record. A French Open victory would give Djokovic a career Grand Slam, and his fourth straight major victory, dating back to last year 2019s Wimbledon. The last men 2019s player to win four straight was Rod Laver, who swept the Grand Slams in 1969. A Roland Garros victory would also give Djokovic a shot at Laver 2019s calendar-year Slam. The French has long eluded Djokovic  2014 he 2019d be the first player to ever win a title on his 12th try. Last year, he beat nine-time champ Rafael Nadal in the quarters, only to fall to Stan Wawrinka in a finals upset. Djokovic, who grew up playing on clay courts, has had mixed-results during French Open tuneups: massive underdog Jiri Vesely knocked him out of Monte Carlo in Djokovic 2019s opening match, and he fell to Andy Murray in the finals of the Italian Open. But he also beat Murray to win Madrid. So why not Roland Garros?  3. Dandy Andy? It 2019s been nearly three years since Andy Murray won a major; at Wimbledon in 2013, he ended Great Britain 2019s infamous 77-year title drought on that hallowed grass. Is the Scotsman due? He rounded into form at the Italian Open, beating Djokovic in the final. In early May, Murray and his coach, former world number-one Am 00e9lie Mauresmo, announced a mutual split: with Mauresmo 2019s family obligations, and duties as France 2019s Fed Cup captain, she couldn 2019t spend sufficient time with her student. Their two-year partnership broke new ground: Murray was the first high-profile men 2019s player to hire a woman as coach. Murray has hinted at a possible reunion with Ivan Lendl, who coached Murray during his two Grand Slam wins, Wimbledon and the 2012 U.S. Open. But there 2019s plenty of time for Murray to sort out the coaching drama. His most urgent task: crash continental Europe 2019s 12-year stranglehold on the men 2019s title (courtesy, for the most part, of Rafael Nadal, who 2019s won nine of them).  4. Keys To Success. After reaching last year 2019s Aussie Open semis, Madison Keys,21, became America 2019s next great hope for the post-Serena era, whenever that arrives. She 2019s never gotten past the third round of the French, the tournament that traditionally gives Americans, who mostly grow up competing on hard courts, the most trouble. But expectations will soar this year because Keys made a surprise run to the Italian Open finals, where she lost to Williams. It was the first time two American women made a clay-court final since Serena beat sister Venus at the 2002 French Open.  In the Italian semis, Keys took out a French Open title threat, Garbing Muguruza of Spain, who 2019s ranked fourth in the world (Keys in now 17th).  201cI mean, I can play on clay? Yes! 201d the New York Times quoted Keys as saying after she beat Muguruza  201cIt 2019s something I 2019m really proud of myself for, and hopefully I can take the experience and use it in the next couple of weeks. It 2019s definitely going to be something that I remind myself of going into every clay-court season:  2018Yeah, I made the final of a red-clay tournament. I can do this thing. 2019 201d  5. Remember Rafa. It 2019s almost sinful to preview the French Open without mentioning Rafael Nadal, despite mixed results in recent Slams. The 14-time Grand Slam champ is going for a tenth title at Roland Garros. In the open era, no player  2014 man or woman  2014 has ever won double digit trophies at a single Grand Slam event (Martina Navratalova has nine Wimbledon titles).  Nadal 2019s the greatest clay court player ever. His almost desperate slides and charges on the Roland Garros dirt have defined the French for more than a decade. In April, Nadal won clay tuneups in Monte Carlo and Barcelona back-to-back, beating names like Murray, Wawrinka and Kei Nishikori along the way. In May, he lost to Murray and Djokovic in Madrid and Rome, respectively; it was Djokovic who handed Nadal just his second loss ever at Roland Garros, when he knocked Nadal out of the quarterfinals a year ago. Tennis fans are pining for a rematch. Let the fun at the French begin. Summary: From Rafa to Novak to America's surprising hope, your guide to get smart fast",

            "input": "text:Rahat, Al-Hazeel - 00c2 SodaStream, the Israeli company that has drawn criticism for operating in the occupied West Bank, will be ending its operations there and is opening a new factory in southern Israel.  The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement (BDS) 00c2 - which uses economic pressure in its pursuit to end the Israeli occupation - has targeted SodaStream, which produces home soda-making machines, for its factory's location in Mishor Adumim, an illegal Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank.  Standing in a plush meeting room in the new SodaStream factory, CEO Daniel Birnbaum refuted criticism of the company.  There's no scandal,  Birnbaum told members of the media.  It's a legitimate factory [in the West Bank]. We're not breaking any international law, but in the meantime we decided to build a new factory here in the Negev.   He said the company had moved to the new factory as it was  cost effective , but admitted BDS had played some role in the move, though he claims it was  minimal .  OPINION: 00c2 Game changer: 10 years of BDS  Birnbaum 00c2 added that SodaStream's presence should have been encouraged in the occupied West Bank. 00c2 He has referred to the West Bank factory as  an island of peace  where Israelis and Palestinians worked  in harmony .  The West Bank factory officially closed last week, resulting in 470 Palestinian workers losing their jobs. The BDS movement claims the decision is a direct result of its pressure.   This closure is a clear-cut BDS victory against an odiously complicit Israeli company,  said Omar Barghouti, a Palestinian human rights activist and co-founder of the BDS movement. Barghouti added that the movement had succeeded in pressuring major retailers across North America and Europe, including Macy's in the US and John Lewis in the UK, to stop stocking SodaStream products. He said SodaStream also closed its flagship store in Brighton in the UK as a result of regular protests. Soros Fund Management, an investment management firm founded by billionaire investor George Soros, sold its stake in the company last year.   After pressure from Soros' partners in the region and the world, they dropped SodaStream and promised, in private letters so far, to issue guidelines similar to those adopted by the EU to prevent any investment into companies that sustain the Israeli occupation and settlements in particular,  Barghouti told the media last year. 00c2  Soros Fund Management did not respond to Al Jazeera's requests for comment.  UpFront - Debating the Israel boycott  But this new factory, too, is proving to be controversial. BDS activists say it is located on land that the Israeli government confiscated from Bedouins in the 1950s. The factory is surrounded by 34 Bedouin villages, which are unrecognised by the Israeli government and are threatened with eviction, but no final date of eviction has been set as the Israeli government's plans have been put on hold.  SodaStream sought to transfer all Palestinian workers to the new Israeli plant, but most were unable to do so because of the very long commute from the occupied West Bank and the difficulty obtaining work permits from the Israeli government, which regularly prevents Palestinians in the West Bank free movement across its checkpoints.  Israel granted the company 130 work permits, but only 37 of the Palestinian staff from the West Bank factory were able to meet the security requirements, which exclude single people and those aged 22 and younger.  Those 37 staff travel up to four hours each day to work in the new factory. Tahsin Hanadi,38, is the only woman among the group:  I leave home at 4:30am each day and I am home at 8:30pm,  she said, detailing a 16-hour ordeal that involves crossing an Israeli checkpoint and going through security checks. She was not angry about the factory's move, but admitted it was harder for her to travel so far each day for work.  The Israeli argument that boycotting the colonies [Jewish settlements] will hurt poor Palestinian workers is disingenuous and intended to divert attention from the illegality of all Israeli colonies in the occupied Palestinian territories.  Omar Barghouti, BDS movement leader  Palestinian Taqsim Mohsin,27, said he travelled to the factory each day from Abu Dis, a neighbourhood in East Jerusalem that was separated from the city when Israel built its illegal separation wall. He travels three-and-a-half hours a day and works 12 hours.   BDS is hurting us; many of us can't get work in the West Bank and wages are so low. We need this work,  Mohsin told Al Jazeera.  But Barghouti disagreed that BDS is to blame, and said high unemployment in the occupied West Bank was a direct result of settlement activity and the separation wall:  Israel's occupation has left hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in dire conditions of poverty. After losing their agricultural lands to settlements, thousands of Palestinians were compelled to work in Israeli projects, including in settlements to subsist,  Barghouti told Al Jazeera.  The Israeli argument that boycotting the colonies [Jewish settlements] will hurt poor Palestinian workers is disingenuous and intended to divert attention from the illegality of all Israeli colonies in the occupied Palestinian territories.   SodaStream's new $90m factory near Rahat, of which the Israeli government contributed $20m according to Birnbaum, was built in a new industrial zone touted by the Israeli government as a solution to sky-high unemployment rates among the Bedouin in the Negev. Forty-seven percent of Bedouin men are unemployed, and 87 percent of women are also unemployed, according to official Israeli government figures.  Human rights lawyer and PhD student Rawia abu Rabia said the origins of high levels of unemployment among Bedouin women began when Israel forced people off their lands:  Forcing women off their lands deprived them of their traditional roles ... and left them with no options - no training and often no education.   She said many Bedouin women simply had not attended school until recently.  Rahat was established by the Israeli government in 1971 as a planned urban township for Bedouins. This came after the government seized the territory, originally known as al-Hazeel, by evicting Bedouins, who previously led a nomadic lifestyle, from their homes. Many of the Bedouins were forced by the Israelis out of the Negev and became refugees inside what is today the occupied West Bank.  Rahat, like the Bedouin villages surrounding it, has some of the poorest living conditions in Israel.  Atiyeh al-A'sam, head of the regional council for the unrecognised Bedouin villages, said that while industrial zones providing employment were important, so was ensuring that Bedouins maintain and develop their agricultural skills.  He said Israel had been discouraging this, by restricting grazing and forcing Bedouins to keep livestock on tiny pockets of land. Industrial parks, like Idan Hanegev, where SodaStream is now located, were not the solution, A'sam told Al Jazeera.  Lawyer and Bedouin community leader Atwa al-Hag Abou Anzeh told a group of journalists that he was critical of the industrial zone, because of the Bedouins' forced removal from their homes to a more urban centre in Rahat:  It was clear when Rahat was established [that] the state wanted to concentrate us in one place and take our land.  Their attempts to help with employment are insults to our intelligence, and you cannot create a partnership like the industrial zone between rich and poor. You must provide the poor with the right conditions to leave the circle of poverty,  he argued.  OPINION: 00c2 I support the Israeli boycott - but which one?  Meanwhile, Barghouti said moving the factory inside Israel would not alleviate pressure from the BDS movement:  The BDS campaign against SodaStream will continue, as the company is moving to a location where it is directly colluding in the ethnic cleansing of Bedouin Palestinian citizens of Israel in the Naqab [Negev]. SodaStream's move is part of the Israeli government's plans to steal the traditional lands of Bedouin Palestinian communities in the Naqab, forcibly displacing them and concentrating them in 'urban' areas.   But Birnbaum defended the new factory's location.  There was nothing here when we laid the cornerstone a few years ago,  he said.  This was just desert. No one lived here, there was no water - nothing.   But historian and director of the Negev office of Adalah, the Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, Thabet Abu Rass confirmed to Al Jazeera that the land on which the industrial park had been built had been confiscated from the Bedouin by Israel in the 1950s. According to Abu Rass,70,000 Bedouin citizens were living in 34 villages that predated the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948:  The state of Israel considers the villages unrecognised and the inhabitants trespassers on state land.    Bedouin [Palestinians] are the most vulnerable community in Israel, and for over 60 years the indigenous Bedouins have faced a state policy of displacement, home demolitions and dispossession of ancestral land.  Summary: The BDS movement will continue its campaign against the Israeli company as it opens a new factory in Bedouin area.",

            "input": "text:Over three quarters (78.7pc) said that a lack of boundaries at home was the reason for challenging, disruptive and abusive behaviour by pupils.  ATL general secretary Dr Mary Bousted said: ''Regrettably teachers and support staff are suffering the backlash from deteriorating standards of behaviour. They are frequently on the receiving end of children's frustration and unhappiness, and have to deal with the fallout from parents failing to set boundaries and family breakdowns. And the huge funding cuts to local services mean that schools often have to deal with children's problems without any help.  ''Schools with firm, clear and consistently enforced behaviour policies create safe learning environments for children and staff, but problems occur when schools fail to enforce good discipline policies and when children know there are weak or non-existent sanctions.''  Overall, the vast majority of school and college staff (88.7pc) said they had dealt with challenging or disruptive behaviour this academic year.  Of these, more than two thirds (68.4pc) said they had dealt with bad behaviour directed at them.  More than half (55pc) of school staff said they had been forced to deal with verbally aggressive pupils, and 21pc had dealt with a child that was physically aggressive.  One primary teacher in West Sussex told researchers: ''I have a five-year old boy in the reception class who has recently been taken into care. His behaviour ranges from being very caring and wanting a lot of attention to swearing at staff, punching, kicking, hitting staff and other children, smashing up furniture and equipment.''  And a primary teacher from Salford said: ''I faced challenging behaviour from a three-year-old child in the first weeks of him entering the school. Being in our nursery has changed this child completely; he knows what is expected of him and where the limits are.''  A Department for Education spokesman said:  Disruptive or violent behaviour has no place whatsoever in the classroom. That is why we have strengthened teachers' powers to put them back in charge.   Teachers can now issue no notice detentions, search a pupil without consent when they suspect they may be in possession of a prohibited item and changes to the system mean a school's decision to exclude a pupil cannot be reversed by an appeals panel.   Our guidance also makes clear that teachers can use force to remove disruptive pupils from the classroom when necessary.   Making sure teachers are fully trained to deal with any sort of challenging or violent behaviour is a core part of teacher standards  2013 and teachers cannot qualify unless they can demonstrate that they can manage children's behaviour.  Summary: A lack of boundaries at home is fuelling naughty behaviour in the classroom,   teachers have warned.",

Syria's civil war: Rebels launch operation to break Aleppo siege  Raed Al Halabi, a fighter in the local Halab al-Shahba Brigades, said on Tuesday a coalition of armed groups will launch shells and car bomb attacks against Aleppo's government-held neighbourhoods with the hope of advancing and opening the government-besieged supply route into the city.  The coalition - Fateh Halab, or Aleppo Conquest - includes most armed rebel groups fighting in the city, including Ahrar al-Sham, Jaysh al-Islam and several factions aligned with the Free Syrian Army. 00c2   The shelling on regime military sites has already started and we will begin the advance soon,  he told Al Jazeera by telephone from the battle frontline in Aleppo.  SANA, the Syrian government's official news agency, reported that at least seven civilians were killed by rebel-launched shells in Aleppo on Tuesday afternoon. 00c2  Fighting has intensified in Aleppo in recent days as government forces target residential areas in the eastern, rebel-held parts of the city with air strikes. 00c2 Rebel groups, meanwhile, have killed at least 30 civilians since Monday in shell attacks on Aleppo's government-held areas.  In recent weeks, government forces have closed off a key supply route in Aleppo, prompting concerns about the lack of food, water, medicines and fuel in the northern city.  Government and Russian air strikes on Tuesday also targeted areas across the outskirts of the city and in the Aleppo countryside, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.  In eastern Aleppo, locals burned tyres en masse to create an impromptu no-fly zone, with the hope of preventing government air strikes from successfully hitting their intended targets.  Middle East analyst Firas Maksad said that while  Aleppo is key  for government efforts to keep supply lines open, for the opposition,  this is really their last stand.   If they lose Aleppo, which they've held a major portion of now for about four odd years, they might as well have lost all the battle for Syria,  the Washington DC-based analyst told Al Jazeera.  Ahmad Jalal, a fighter in Jaish al-Islam, confirmed the escalation of the efforts to drive back government forces, saying that rebels have attacked al-Ramosa neighbourhood, a stronghold of government forces and militias loyal to Assad.  Speaking to Al Jazeera, he claimed that rebel fighters, including those from the Ahrar al-Sham armed group, took control of several buildings throughout Ramosa.  Khalil Hajjar, a media activist at the Aleppo Media Centre, said opposition fighters were advancing in the western Aleppo countryside.  The battles are ongoing and the regime is losing ground,  he told Al Jazeera.  Rebels have intensified their efforts to break a government-imposed siege in parts of Aleppo [Zouhir Al Shimale Al Jazeera]  In Aleppo's Hamdania neighbourhood, a government-held area, Fatah Halab also launched shells and bomb attacks.  Smoke and fire has filled the whole area,  Hajjar said. 00c2  Earlier on Tuesday, the Syrian Civil Defence said helicopters 00c2 had dropped containers of chlorine gas 00c2 overnight on the rebel-controlled Saraqeb town in the Idlib province. The group said several people were hospitalised due to the effects of the gas. 00c2  A day earlier, the Russian defence ministry said five Russian soldiers were killed near Saraqeb when their helicopter was shot down. 00c2  Sharif Nashashibi, a London-based Middle East analyst and writer, described the opposition fighters' campaign as  their last-ditch attempt to keep Aleppo  as government forces attempt to further besiege rebel-held neighbourhoods.   But the effectiveness of the rebels' counteroffensive depends on the level of support their backers are willing to supply,  Nashashibi told Al Jazeera.  The Syrian conflict started as a largely unarmed uprising against Assad's government in March 2011, but it quickly escalated into a full-on civil war that has left at least 280,000 people dead, according to the Observatory. 00c2  Efforts to mediate a ceasefire have collapsed time and again. 00c2  Additional reporting from Aleppo by Zouhir Al Shimale: @ZouhirAlShimale  Inside Story - What's behind Russian humanitarian corridors in Aleppo?

The I.O.C. will award the bronze medal to the United States , which had finished fourth in the team event and had left the 2000 Olympics empty-handed.

Internet sports registries and other sources showed that those gymnasts were under-age. To compete at the Games, gymnasts must be at least 16 in an Olympic year.  In the end, the International Gymnastics Federation did not find any proof of wrongdoing. But in Dong 2019s case, the federation did have evidence.  The federation had been investigating Dong for possible age falsification since she filed paperwork to work as an official at the Beijing Games. The age on those documents would have made her 14 at the Sydney Olympics.  In February, after a lengthy investigation, the federation revoked Dong 2019s results from those Games, as well as from several other major competitions. It also asked the I.O.C. to strip the Chinese team of its medal. All of Dong 2019s results from the Sydney Games, including a sixth-place finish in the floor exercise and a seventh-place finish on the vault, were wiped from the record books.

On Sunday, thousands of churches across the country will take part in the fifth annual  Orphan Sunday  to bring attention to the cause of adoption. It's not just a matter of advocacy: Financial support for orphan-related matters has surged in recent years, becoming one of the top targets of evangelical giving, according to the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability.  In 2012, the Center for Philanthropy at Indiana University reports, charitable giving by Americans rose about 3.5% from the previous year. Meanwhile, Christians donating to adoption causes rose by 9.5% and to groups focused on orphan care by 17%.  Megan Hill, who lives with her husband in Jackson, Miss., is one of many evangelicals who have been drawn to the cause. When Ms. Hill and her husband adopted their son, Caleb, five years ago, the only other evangelical families she knew that had considered adoption were those who struggled with infertility. The Hills already had a biological son. But without maternity insurance and after listening to an appeal from a Bethany Christian Services representative at their church, they adopted locally.  Within three years of their first adoption, the Hills decided to adopt another son 2014this time from Ethiopia. Ms. Hill says she knows about 50 evangelical families with biological children in the Jackson area who have started the adoption process in the past few years.  There was an attitude of 'However many millions of orphans, we're going to solve this crisis,'   Ms. Hill says.  Jedd Medefind, president of the Christian Alliance for Orphans, notes that caring for orphans has been a hallmark of the religion for centuries. But he acknowledges a recent wave of interest and says it accompanied Christians' focus on the global AIDS crisis, encouraged by Rick Warren and other pastors.  Well-known members of the evangelical community have also played a role: Former Indianapolis Colts football coach Tony Dungy, retired megachurch Pastor John Piper and musician Steven Curtis Chapman are all adoptive parents. Then there's the fact that adoption is a natural extension of the pro-life movement.  But in the midst of its rapid growth, the evangelical adoption movement has experienced some growing pains.  Early on, there was adoption cheerleading: 'It's beautiful, we need this,'   Mr. Medefind says.  Now Christians are talking about ethical questions, like guarding against corruption.   International adoption is full of ethical and financial challenges, largely because adoptive children are coming from poor countries with opaque bureaucracies, and agencies stand to gain thousands of dollars per child.  The movement has ignored and minimized those challenges,  says David Smolin, director for the Center for Children, Law, and Ethics, at Cumberland School of Law in Birmingham, Ala.  Mr. Smolin, who describes himself as an evangelical, is the father of six biological children and two girls adopted from India. Fifteen years ago, he and his wife discovered that their adopted daughters had been stolen from their birth parents.  We went through a horrible learning experience,  Mr. Smolin says.  It's very frustrating to me that the movement arose while these problems still existed.  He thinks evangelical groups need to  emphasize other kinds of interventions,  including finding extended family to care for the child in his or her home country.  Some evangelical groups, in their fervor for adoption, have inflated the numbers of orphans globally to create the idea that there is an  orphan crisis,  according to journalist Kathryn Joyce, author of the recent book,  The Child Catchers: Rescue, Trafficking, and the New Gospel of Adoption.   To illustrate the complications of international adoption, Ms. Joyce points to the surge in American parents adopting children from Ethiopia. In 1997, 82 Ethiopian children were adopted. By 2010, there were 2,511. On the surface, this sounds like great news, but a Unicef study found that 75% of children in Ethiopian orphanages had parents or extended families. Some children in the orphanages had been stolen. In other cases, a parent couldn't afford to care for the child anymore.  Adoption efforts seemed incredibly well intentioned but complicated and easy to do wrong,  Ms. Joyce told me.  In Megan Hill's Mississippi community, she says, families who have traveled to the countries where their adoptive children were born begin thinking differently about adoption. Some families became more selective about the agencies they use, and others considered hiring private investigators to prevent possible trafficking.   Now the things that are discussed are not as much about solving the orphan crisis as it is about how we can help these countries,  Ms. Hill says.  It becomes a little more holistic than just 'Let's adopt children.'    Ms. Bailey is a national correspondent for Religion News Service. Summary: In The Wall Street Journal, Sarah Pulliam Bailey writes that evangelical Christians' laudable desire to rescue orphans should include concern about corruption.",

He's 0-for-2 with Television Academy voters.  These facts are not unrelated.  In fact, as the bellicose orange-hued bloviator goes after a much bigger prize, his Emmy history might provide a small clue as to what could happen if he doesn't actually end up in the Oval Office. Just as he's upended traditional campaign etiquette, he trashed awards-show decorum when the show he hosted and executive produced,  The Apprentice,  lost to  The Amazing Race  in 2004 and 2005.  Also Read: Wall Street Journal Rips Donald Trump: 'Behave' Like You Want to Be President  Making matters worse, it wasn't even nominated for Outstanding Reality Competition Program for the next 10 years when it and its successor,  The Celebrity Apprentice,  were on the air.   The Amazing Race,  said Trump at one point, is  irrelevant.  It's  a piece of crap,  he added later. The CBS show's 10 wins over 13 years are  a total joke,  he tweeted.  And on Twitter in 2012, he summed up the whole mess like this:  The Emmys have no credibility  2014 no wonder the ratings are at record lows ...   [Note: They weren't.]  The Emmys are all politics, that's why, despite nominations, 'The Apprentice' never won  2014 even though it should have many times over.   Also Read: Donald Trump Goes on Twitter Rampage Against 'Corrupt, 'Dishonest' Media  As entertaining as it would have been to see Kevin Spacey call Jon Hamm a pathetic, boring lightweight after Hamm took home the Emmy last year, that's not the way it usually works at awards shows. But that's how it works with Trump, who even shared this sparkling anecdote on  The Celebrity Apprentice  in 2014, yet another year in which his show wasn't nominated for anything:   I got screwed out of an Emmy,  he said, thinking back to his first time as a nominee.  Everybody thought I was gonna win it. In fact, when they announced the winner, I stood up before the winner was announced, and I started walking for the Emmy. And then they announced the most boring show on television, 'The Amazing Race.'   Still, you have to give The Donald this: The man provided us with one of the most deliciously jaw-dropping moments in recent Emmy history. It came in 2006, when he and  Will and Grace  star Megan Mullally took the stage to  sing,  if that's the right word  2014 and no, it really isn't  2014 the theme from  Green Acres.   Also Read: Emmys Hot List: 50 Shows, Actors and Trends to Watch (Photos)  If it wasn't much of a song before he got hold of it, it was a quivering wreck when he was finished.  Trump, by the way, is a member of the Television Academy, and has been since the first season of  The Apprentice.   So really, there's no reason he couldn't come back and make the Emmys great again.

            "input": "text:Battling a horde of zombies may sound like your average commute to work, but for some it 2019s how they 2019ll be getting to know their managers this summer.  If you 2019re faced with zombies coming at you you 2019re relying on your team mates and it 2019s survival of the fittest  That 2019s right, fighting off a zombie apocalypse in an abandoned shopping centre is one of the latest popular choices for a team away day in Britain.  Philippe Bell is the Adventure Category Manager at events provider Buyagift.com. He says the zombie adventures they offer to clients typically cost around  00a3100 ($130) and are particularly popular with office-based employees such as banks and call centres.   201cThe key thing is the adrenalin rush especially when workers are sitting at their desks all day. Battling zombies is a great way of building relationships within companies. If you 2019re faced with zombies coming at you you 2019re relying on your team mates and it 2019s survival of the fittest, it 2019s like a war and whoever is victorious will carry on living. 201d  While some can 2019t wait to hurl themselves round an assault course or get stuck in to raft building, others can think of nothing worse than bonding over paintballing.  Fan or not, you 2019ll probably end up taking part in a team-building event at some point in your working life, so what can you expect?  For one firm average spend on a team-building-event has increased by 32% in just 3 years, from  00a31,970 ($2,588) in 2013 to  00a32,592 ($3,405) in 2016 according to Team Challenge Company, one of the UK 2019s biggest providers of corporate team building. It works with big corporations from publishers to oil companies.  One year we went to Las Vegas, got picked up by helicopters and landed in the Grand Canyon for a picnic  Cathy Israel, chief operating officer at Best Corporate Events, one of the biggest firms in the US, says per company average annual spend is difficult to pinpoint, but the average spend per event is around $9,000. One company purchased an event for 6,571 participants  201cthat totalled nearly $400,0,  she adds.  As budgets become more extravagant so have the activities involved. Once upon a time bowling and a pizza might have covered it but things have gone off-piste to include everything from training to be a stunt person or gum-boot dancing in a bid to get employees talking.  The one that will forever stick in my mind involved everyone being told to karate chop a piece of wood in half  At the luxury end, at $100,000 a week for up to eight people, firms like Valdez Heli Ski Guides in Alaska clients can take a helicopter to the top of a mountain and shoot back down on skis, staying at a private lodge with private dining, according to founder Scott Raynor.   201cWe 2019ve had teams from investment bank Merrill Lynch, Apple, Google and big law firms, 201d Raynor says.  201cThey 2019ve mastered their skills and are looking for new challenges. 201d  But does an expensive week of hair-raising heli-skiing genuinely improve working relationships?  Raynor has no doubt it does:  201cIt definitely builds team unity because you need to create mutual a sense of trust and more importantly, be yourself and drop any facade. 201d  But your firm doesn 2019t need to spend a fortune. Less expensive at  00a388 ($115) per person but no less adrenalin-fuelled are the Hunger Games team-building events organised by UK company Rabble. Teams are split into groups and sent hunting for items that might help them on their final quest. For the end game they use battle equipment such as laser guns, dodgeballs, archery equipment and like the real Hunger Games, the last man or woman standing wins.  What kind of company sends its employees on a simulated killing spree? Founder Charlotte Roach says customers range from tech starts-ups to supermarket chains and HR companies but that it 2019s particularly popular with competitive professions such as sales teams and bankers. That doesn 2019t mean quieter, more thoughtful types are left on the sidelines, Roach says.   201cIntroverts enjoy playing because they 2019re given a set of rules to stick to. They shout less and think more and tend to be super successful, 201d she says.  There are subtler approaches to team bonding: Horse Sense takes an animal-centred approach to team work by literally getting hands on with horses. In the middle of the English countryside, a makeshift classroom has been erected next to some stables. Karen Fleming, managing director of the company 2019s management training and coaching business called Sense and Ability, she explains how it all works.   201cHorses are incredibly intuitive and pick up on what we are feeling, 201d she says.  201cWe do a mindfulness exercise which involves asking the clients to put their hands on the horse, relax and breathe slowly. We observe how the horses react and behave as clients interact with them. It 2019s very effective; horses get to the core of people straightaway so we immediately get feedback on how they 2019re behaving and how they 2019re communicating with each other and themselves. 201d  Why do some bosses think this is a good investment?  But at  00a3150 ($197) per person for an afternoon, is Horse Sense just an expensive novelty? Chris Hurst, a director of Tazamo web design who came along to Horse Sense with his team says there 2019s method behind this unconventional approach.   201cWe 2019ve recently changed the way we work from office based to remote working and we want to improve our communications, so we thought why not do this? I 2019ve taken colleagues on other team-building days, but nothing quite like this. Our company thrives on imagination and if we can find something different, we 2019ll throw ourselves into it. It 2019s the best way to find out about yourself. 201d  Our company thrives on imagination and if we can find something different, we 2019ll throw ourselves into it.  Another manager who prefers to think differently and get his team doing the same is Brian Scudamore, CEO and founder of O2E Brands, based in Vancouver, Canada. There are four businesses under the O2E banner doing junk hauling, painting, moving and home improvements. All work on a franchise basis and with annual revenues of $250m. Scudamore says he is keen to keep his franchisees working efficiently, and incentivise his top performing employees.   201cOne year we went to Las Vegas, got picked up by helicopters and landed in the Grand Canyon for a picnic. Another year we drove NASCARs, racing around the track at nearly 150mph. In 2015, 100 employees including myself signed up for the Tough Mudder assault course. It cost around $100 per person but it was definitely worth it, 201d he says.  201cExperiences like jumping from a great height into icy cold water take you out of your comfort zone and you 2019d be amazed at how those types of experiences make people work better together. 201d  Not everyone 2019s cup of tea  The more extreme kind of team-building exercises aren 2019t for everyone however. Amelia Bowman now works in the oil industry in London but used to be a television producer.   201cI 2019ve had my fair share of team-building exercises but the one that will forever stick in my mind involved everyone being told to karate chop a piece of wood in half with their bare hands in the middle of a circle of onlooking colleagues. I was one of the ones who was unable to break the wood. It was extremely humiliating and far from boosting self-confidence and generating a sense of team work, it had quite the opposite effect. 201d  Rob Briner, professor of organisational psychology at the University of Bath is also sceptical.   201cIt can be counterproductive; some people would rather just get on with their job or spend time with family. Companies should spend a lot more time working out what the actual problems with their employees are. I think one reason team-building events are so popular is that they 2019re seen as an activity that people will enjoy so it 2019s hoped they will hit lots of buttons; improving morale, improving communication and so on. Unfortunately I think the trend in corporations is on having more fun rather than removing stress and team-building events are part of this. 201d  It can be counterproductive 2026 Companies should spend a lot more time working out what the actual problems are  Bowman is prepared to keep an open mind however.   201cWhen team-building events are done properly there can be positives such as breaking of cross-disciplinary boundaries, 201d she says.  201cIt can be good to meet folk from other departments and discover that they are actually quite nice. This enables a far more cordial manner of working. I would also add however that this outcome can also be readily achieved by simply going down the pub! 201d  To comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Capital, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter. Summary: Companies are doing away with the standard team-building exercises in favour of extreme stunts like battling zombies and heli-skiing. But are these stunts worth the money?",

            "input": "text:FORT KNOX, Ky.  2014 The Pentagon has approved plans for a battle tank of the nineteen 2010eighties with unprecedented levels of fire power, mobility and protection.   201cWe've put it all together, 201d said Maj. Gen. William R. Desobry, head of the 33 2010man Army team that recommended production of the new tank.  201cWe ought to be shot if it doesn't work. 201d  One 2010third of a century after the German blitzkrieg smashed the French Army and established the tank as the new queen of battles, the development of powerful antitank weapons has produced some skeptics who believe, as one Australian officer put it, the tank is  201cas anachronistic as medieval body armor. 201d  But the upholders of the tank as a decisive Weapon, including many Israeli officers, are unshaken. General Desobry's task force  201cfeels that the new tank, the XM 20101, will be not only superior to the Soviet T 201062 but also the very heart of the combined arms team of helicopters, antitank weapons, and tanks that will dominate future battlefields.  Faith in the tank's future is understandably strong here at the Armor Center. The Patton Museum of Cavalry and Armor, with its adjoining display of tanks and guns from World War I onward, stands nearby and the spirit of Gen. George S. Patton Jr., the patron saint of tankers, remains strong throughout the post.  The task force's recommendations for the XM 20101 were approved by the Department of Defense in January. Brig. Gen. Robert Baer has been named production manager for the Army and the tank's specifications have been sent to General Motors and the Chrysler Corporation. The two companies will report their ideas on the new tank to the Army Materiel Command.  The XM 20101 is the Army's second attempt at designing a tank to succeed the M 201060 and subsequent improved models of that tank. The original M 201060 first went into service in 1961.  The Armed Services Committee of the House of Representafives killed the first attempt in June, 1971. By then the Army had spent more than $500 2010million on a tank, the XM803, that would have cost more than $800,000 each to produce.  The XM 20101 will cost  201cslightly below $500,000 in constant 1972 dollars, 201d according to General Desobry. No one can say now, either here or in the Pentagon, how many the Army will need. The current Army and Marine Corps inventory is approximately 4,500 tanks of all types.  No specific recommendation was made on the size of the gun that will be the XM 20101's main armament beyond the stipulation that it should be between 105 and 120 mm. Britain and Germany are working on a new 110 2010mm gun and the Army will await the results of their tests. Pentagon sources say that, tri 2010lateral development of a new gun would reduce costs.  The team decided on a conventional gun rather than the combined gun 2010Shillelagh missile launcher that is fitted on the M 201060A1E2, the Army's most advanced main battle tank, and the Sheridan armored reconnaissance vehicle.   201cThere will be plenty of missiles in the tank team, 201d General Desobry explained,  201cthe TOW in helicopters and on the ground, the Dragon with infantry. What we need is a gun that can knock out enemy tanks and we'll have it. 201d  The Shillelagh has developed some weaknesses. The missile has a relatively long flight time during which, for guidance purposes, the firing tank must remain stationary, thus increasing its vulnerability. Also, the missile is said to be affected by bad weather conditions.  The fire control system ?? the XM 20101 represents a  201clong jump forward, 201d according to General Desobry. There is also an advanced stabilizing system for the gun platform. The tank will be driven by a 1,500 horsepower engine compared to the 900 horsepower engine in the M 201060 series.  This engine, General Desobry said, will provide the tank with greater mobility. The speed is expected to be approximately 50 miles an hour on roads and about one 2010third of that across country. The XM 20101 will be slightly larger in size than the present series of M 201060's and will weigh about 54 tons.  The silhouette has been dropped from 120 to 95 inches and the cupola, a distinctive feature of the M 201060 series, eliminated. In addition to the main armament, the XM 20101 will be armed with a Bushmaster cannon of 20 or 30 2010mm and a 7.62 machinegun.  Specifications for the tank's armor are classified. However, Mere have been reports that XM 20101's heavy armor, will be set in oblique angles to deflect hits by antitank weapons.  Ammunition will be compartmentalized. This means that if the ammunition compartment is hit it will blow out from the rear of the tank rather than inward on the crew.  The tank's impressive specifications must be weighed against constant improvements in antitank weapons. The latter now include area weapons, small bombs or mines that can be spread from the air or by artillery. These would not knock out a tank but, by blowing off a track, could immobilize it and leave it vulnerable to heavier weapons.  Both Britain and Germany are producing area weapons in large numbers and it is assumed that the Soviet Union has followed suit.  General Desobry and other supporters of the tank argue that predictions of the tank's demise are premature. The publie and some critics, they say, tend to think of tanks operating alone.  201cThey've seen too many movies, 201d the general said.  Modern tank doctrine emphasizes the combined arms team in which reconnaissance vehicles, helicopter gun ships, assault and antitank guns and missile launchers will operate with tanks.   201cThis doctrine is far more important than it was 15 years ago, 201d General Desobry said.  201cIn combination it gives you a look at the  2018other side of the hill 2019 by the helicopters, missiles and guns to attack their tanks and your own tanks for hitting power.   201cSure, we'll lose some tanks to area weapons and missiles. But today's missiles are no more dangerous to modern tanks than the Panzer Faust and the Bazooka were to the tanks of World War II. The Israeli experience showed that. No, tanks are vital to settle the fundamental issue in battle. 201d  We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.

Punk 2019s self-starter-D.I.Y. impulse was its most important consequence, and dissidence was vital, too. Punk is applicable across cultures and times.  It is a passionless and immediate dismissal of intimidation. A contempt for organized power structures that registers as pure instinct. A desire to confront that is indistinguishable from lust.  Punk is a D.I.Y. attitude, to step forward without any restraint and fight like a warrior until you achieve what you were aiming for.  It is a four-letter word aptly ending with the letter K, which has been extremely handy when affixed to music, poetry, fashion, art, politics, dance and media; probably there will be punk fitness, philosophy, economics, sports, cooking and things we don 2019t yet have names for.

A female teacher at the elite Sydney Grammar school was suspended as soon as the school knew about allegations of her having sex with a 17-year-old male pupil, the headmaster says.  The teacher at the Darlinghurst school allegedly kissed the boy while he was under her care and had sex with him twice in Newtown between January and February this year.  She is also accused of having sex with him four times in Darlinghurst between January and March.  Her case was mentioned in the Downing Centre Local Court on Tuesday, when a lawyer acting for several media companies argued against the need for an order preventing the publication of the teacher's name.  Magistrate Jacqueline Milledge said naming the teacher risked revealing the identity of the underage schoolboy, whose identity is protected by law.  But publishing the name of the school was of interest to those studying there and may encourage any other victims to come forward, she said.  Following the court appearance Sydney Grammar's headmaster John Vallance released a statement saying the school had suspended the teacher and parents had been notified.   As soon as the school became aware of the allegations, the employee concerned was suspended and forbidden to have any contact with pupils pending the outcome of the matter,  Mr Vallance said.  The school's alumni spans from the current Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, to the very first, Sir Edmund Barton and also includes Banjo Patterson.  The woman, who was arrested on October 14, is charged with seven offences, six counts of having sex with someone under her care between 17 and 18 years and one of indecent assault.  The teacher, who has been granted bail, was not present in court on Tuesday. Summary: Sydney Grammar has been revealed as the school at which a teacher allegedly had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old student.",

More plausibly, this trader could have been attempting to manipulate beliefs about the odds of victory in an attempt to boost fundraising, campaign morale, and turnout.  In all, the paper looked at a 15-day period during which 3.5 million contracts were traded between 3,200 accounts on Intrade 2014which has since been disbanded under regulatory pressure 2014and Betfair.  The sites were popular places for bettors to play the election, and the trends reflecting the probable results were cited frequently by the media:  The single largest trader was responsible for more than one-sixth of (double-counted) total volume, with more than 1.2 million contracts bought or sold in about 13,000 distinct transactions. The most frequent trader engaged in almost 34,000 transactions, accounting for more than 20 percent of (double-counted) total observations. The largest 32 traders (just 1 percent of the trading population) were responsible for 60 percent of volume, while the 32 most frequent traders accounted for 57 of transactions.  (Read more: DC's autumn chill means heated political battles)  One of those traders clearly went all-in for Romney.  Trader A was responsible for one-third of the total money on Romney over the two weeks in our sample, and about a quarter over the entire cycle. The result was a loss of close to four million dollars over the two week period, and a likely loss of almost seven million overall. What could possibly have motivated this activity? Given that the trader bet on Romney and not Obama, we can rule out cross-market arbitrage with Betfair as a motivation.  This leaves three possibilities: (i) the trader was convinced that Romney was underpriced throughout the period and was expressing a price view, (ii) he was hedging an exposure held elsewhere, or (iii) he was attempting to distort prices in the market for some purpose.  Ultimately, the analysis  leaves open the possibility  that the trade was simply about  market manipulation for political purposes  and whoever lost the money really didn't care.  The trading losses, while hardly trivial, pale in comparison with the cost of contemporary political campaigns. Beliefs about the likelihood of victory are important determinants of fundraising as well as volunteer effort and morale.  Some voters appear to have a preference for affiliation with a winning candidate, and are prepared to abandon those seen as likely to lose. Turnout can also be affected by perceived candidate viability. Intrade was among the most closely watched indicators of campaign vitality, resulting in incentives for price manipulation to boost support, donations, effort and morale prior to the election and turnout while voting was in progress. The last swing state to close its polls was Colorado at 9pm ET (7 pm local time), and this is almost exactly when the floor in the Romney contract gave way.  The paper found the manipulation of the market successful at least to a point, with the trading strategy remaining intact even if Obama still won the election.

Such dynamics are most likely to arise in electoral prediction markets and in sports betting, but similar effects may well exist also for common stock.

Garry Reginald Dubois,69, is accused of raping and murdering siblings Vicki and Leanne McCulkin and killing their mother Barbara.  The prosecution alleges Dubois and his co-accused, Vincent O'Dempsey, took the McCulkins from their Highgate Hill home on or about January 16, 1974 and murdered them in bushland.  Then-neighbour Janet Gayton, has told the Brisbane Supreme Court she saw two men at the McCulkins' house that evening, the same night a birthday party was being held for her sister at their own home.  Ms Gayton, then aged 13, said she went to the McCulkins' house around 6.30pm and saw two men, including a man inside called Vince she'd previously met.  She said the other man was called  Shorty , a name the court has heard was Dubois' nickname.   I think I asked what Shorty's real name was, they told me but I don't recall what it was,  Ms Gayton said.  The court also heard evidence on Tuesday about how the McCulkins claimed to have knowledge of the 1973 Whisky Au Go Go nightclub blaze that killed 15 people.  The prosecution alleges the suspected connection between the fatal blaze and the Torino club fire 11 days earlier provided a motive for the murders.  Witness Ellen Ashford (nee Gilbert) said Mrs McCulkin, a former workmate, was worried and thought her house was bugged after the Whisky Au Go Go blaze.  Peter Nisbet, a former neighbour of the McCulkins, said Mrs McCulkin had given him the impression that her estranged husband Bill had some involvement in the club fires.   She said that if the police had asked Bill some questions, or the right questions, they may get additional information about Whisky Au Go Go and the Torino firebombings,  he told the court.  The jury heard on Monday evidence would be presented that the group involved in the Torino blaze, allegedly organised by O'Dempsey and including Dubois, was worried about being linked to the Whisky Au Go Go fire.  In his opening address, crown prosecutor David Meredith said the suspected connection between the fires would provide a motive for Dubois and O'Demspey to keep Mrs McCulkin quiet.  Dubois has pleaded not guilty to three counts of murder, two counts of rape and one count of deprivation of liberty. O'Dempsey is to face trial next year.  It's alleged Dubois assisted O'Dempsey kidnap the McCulkins and murder them. It's further alleged Dubois raped one of the daughters and assisted O'Dempsey to rape the other.  The trial before Justice Peter Applegarth continues. Summary: Two men were seen at the home of a Brisbane woman and her two daughters on the same day they were allegedly taken and murdered, a court has heard.",

            "input": "text:A search by Thomson Reuters found that materials companies Airgas, Praxair and Sherwin Williams all complained about weather impact, as did industrial names 2014United Parcel Service and Stanley Black & Decker.  Harrison points out that some companies besides utilities saw positive effects. For instance, Johnson Controls had higher volumes in North America and said the weather could be a tailwind, and O'Reilly Automotive said the early and extreme cold in the Midwest helped its sales because of more parts failures.  Meanwhile, Group 1 Automotive said Tuesday that 105 of its 118 stores have been impacted by hazardous driving conditions and road closures that have resulted in store closures or reduced traffic. It said the storm events resulted in the equivalent of 391 lost selling days for the quarter, or the equivalent of about a 9 percent loss in total available selling days through Feb. 16.  The utility sector is faring better. Utilities Wisconsin Energy and Exelon got boosts from cold weather, Harrison noted.  (Watch: Cold weather outlook fuels energy prices)  AGL Resources, the pipelines and gas utilities company, is one of the companies in the sweet spot to benefit. In a note last week, Citigroup analysts said they were raising their estimates on the company based on its infrastructure investment program and colder than normal temperatures. They have a neutral rating on the stock but boosted the price target to $48.  Home builders have not yet seen first-quarter earnings estimates revised lower, and in fact estimates for the household durables group were raised slightly, from 8 percent to 8.2 percent, according to Short at S&P. But that could change. The National Association of Home Builders survey Tuesday showed a steep drop, from 56 to 46, the biggest one-month decline since the index was launched in 1985 and the first time since May that it has been below 50.  Companies in the business of transportation have been particularly challenged.  After its recent earnings report, C.H. Robinson said it's margins were hurt by the weather.   In the past, we've always believed that ... volume would come back after a period of time,  CEO John Wiehoff said on a conference call.   I don't know, in some of the January weather whether that was true or not, it does feel like some of the worst weather days in the month of January did diminish volumes pretty significantly where there wasn't a corresponding rebound to it. So that's another thing that we'll study more over time, but it does feel like weather was a contributor to some of our challenges over the last couple of months,  he said.  United Continental Holdings also described bad weather on its earnings conference call, with Vice Chairman James Compton calling the subzero arctic blast in the first week of January  among the worst weather events in our history,  resulting in 6,300 canceled flights. The airlines have canceled tens of thousands of flights this winter, and some of that lost revenue probably won't be recovered.  (Read more: NY manufacturing cools in February after surge)  The rail industry is also likely to feel headwinds, with storms impacting freight volume.   The weather could play an increasing role in shipper's inventory decisions given that retailers typically switch to spring merchandise in February,  Citigroup rail analyst Christian Wetherbee said in a note.  However, shoppers may be reluctant to spend for warmer weather items with winter still in full force across much of the country.   Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts have been wary of consumer discretionary stocks for a while and say more than weather may be to blame for soft sales.   While some of this is due to the weather, we have noted that negative surprises from consumer- oriented companies have been trending higher over the last several quarters,  they wrote in a note Tuesday.   This quarter's results could mark the weakest 4Q [year-over-year] growth for discretionary since the crisis. While guidance has recently improved for staples, it has deteriorated for discretionary. We remain market weight staples and underweight discretionary,  the BofAML note said.  Suzuki said it appears there has been a slowdown but growth should pick up.   From an academic standpoint, the impact of a single month or a couple of months of bad weather isn't huge in terms of the long-term earnings of a company, and it's less bad if you think about the different industries and sectors,  he said.  Retail is probably going to get a little bounce back as the weather improves whereas in other areas it's lost for good, like restaurants.  Summary: So far, the stock market has looked past the weather impacts on manufacturing, housing, consumer spending and even hiring.",

Just as he is putting a new emphasis on letting allies take the lead  0097 on Iran and North Korea, notably  0097 some of the leaders he needs most are lined up at the check-out desk.  This is true from Mexico to Japan, but particularly noticeable in Europe, where leader after leader faces a dropoff in prospects for his program  0097 and himself.  What's going on? Partly it's power fatigue. It may also be the diminishing of optimism. In the last five years, members of the European Union have retreated to protectionism and nationalism. Nobody is sure how to deal with a rising China, a backpedaling Russia. Shocks to optimism were delivered by terrorism, the Iraq war, unhappy immigrants. Prospects for disarming North Korea and keeping Iran from eventually getting the bomb look dimmer.  Not every grand vision of the 90's is dead: Democracy is still a growth stock in the world. The global economy is growing. Still, a number of the West's leaders are realizing at the same time that they will be measured by what happened on their watch. At such a time, it's tempting to focus on tomorrow  0097 in hopes that history may be kinder to them than public opinion is today. DAVID E. SANGER  PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH, UNITED STATES  POWER BASE Republican loyalists. George W. Bush barely made it into the Oval Office in the 2000 election but brilliantly capitalized on his handling of the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11,2001, attacks. He won re-election in 2004 largely on confidence he would keep Americans safer. When he pushed through an aggressive tax cut plan, he delighted conservatives. But it was his willingness to use American power  0097 first in Afghanistan, then to chase down terrorists, and finally to topple Saddam Hussein  0097 that galvanized his supporters.  ACCOMPLISHMENTS Three key goals met. The Taliban and Saddam Hussein are out of power, and Mr. Bush has moved the Supreme Court to the right. The rest is ambiguous. Tax cuts may have revived the economy, but deficits have ballooned. Mr. Bush hoped the liberation of Iraq would change the dynamics of the Middle East, but many Americans now seem more interested in knowing when and how America will get out.  TROUBLES Osama, Katrina, Dubai, deficits and defecting Republicans. Mr. Bush has battled accusations of incompetence in the Iraq war and hurricane relief. Concerning Iraq, many administration officials seem willing to define victory down to allow a faster withdrawal. Congress is threatening to review Mr. Bush's acts on warrantless wiretaps. Iran is racing toward acquiring nuclear weapons. Opinion polls put his approval ratings in the mid-30's.  A TIN EAR? Port safety. Allowing the sale of some American port operations to a Dubai company seemed a case of not seeing trouble coming.  PROSPECTS Quack? In the 2004 campaign, Mr. Bush said he had 18 months to get things done before he was  quacking like a duck.  Now that looks optimistic. DAVID E. SANGER  PRIME MINISTER TONY BLAIR, BRITAIN  POWER BASE The yuppie center. Young, photogenic and energetic, he swept into power in 1997, and restyled a working-class party as New Labor. He also drew in disillusioned Conservatives. For a brief, shining moment, Britannia was cool again.  ACCOMPLISHMENTS Laws, laws, laws. Mr. Blair used his huge early parliamentary majority to give Britons their first American-style bill of rights and freedom of information legislation. After the Sept. 11 attacks, he muscled tough antiterrorism legislation past Labor traditionalists and civil liberties-minded Conservatives. He poured money into the National Health Service.  TROUBLES George Bush. Britain was America's closest ally in the invasion of Iraq  0097 a war Britons in general did not want and increasingly hate. The anger has only intensified with revelations about the failures of prewar intelligence and American treatment of prisoners, and with the leaking of memos that seem to show that Mr. Bush was determined to go to war and Mr. Blair did nothing to talk him out of it. His detractors call this blind loyalty. Recently, Mr. Blair has faced an erosion of his parliamentary majority, particularly as Conservatives smell blood and left-leaning Laborites rebel.  A TIN EAR? Too glib? A slick, silver-tongued debater, he has outlasted three Conservative leaders while in office. But in 1997, his ease with words got him in trouble, too. After the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, he went on television and coined the phrase  the people's princess,  provoking charges of insincerity and showboating.  PROSPECTS An exit strategy. Mr. Blair has publicly declared that he will step down, ceding power to his chancellor of the exchequer, Gordon Brown, sometime in the next few years. SARAH LYALL  POWER BASE The entitled elite. Mr. Chirac went to the best French schools and got help from two powerful patrons: the French defense contractor Marcel Dassault, for whom his father was banker, and President Georges Pompidou, for whom the young Mr. Chirac was a close aide. By 1974, Mr. Chirac was prime minister. Throughout a long career, personal charm and willingness to cut through France's leaden bureaucracy to get things done has won him widespread support.

            "input": "text:Friday, September 29th 1995, 4:32AM  A group of 15 wealthy families has jumped into the fight for Rockefeller Center with a plan aimed at knocking out two high-profile rivals that until now have dominated the battle.  The group, Gotham Partners, proposed yesterday that the real estate investment trust that now holds the mortgage on the New York landmark raise $105 million by selling new stock to existing shareholders in order to gain control of the entire center.  Analysts said the offer has a good chance at besting multi-million dollar offers made by Goldman Sachs and a group that includes Chicago investor Sam Zell and Walt Disney.  Gotham whose members include the Ziff family, which recently made more than $1 billion when it sold its publishing empire purchased 5.6% of the trust's shares when they were selling at a steep discount. If their plan succeeds they stand to make a huge profit if the center rises in value.  Gotham said in a letter to the trust that its plan has the support of its other major shareholders.  The trust is in line to become the owner of the complex because Mitsubishi and the Rockefeller family said last month that they were giving up their struggle to hold onto it. They put it into a bankruptcy last May.  Goldman Sachs and the Zell group have both made offers to buy the majority of the shares in the trust. But both of those offers would dilute the ownership of current investors.   Our transaction permits the company to continue as a widely-held public company without a transfer of control to an outside investor,  Gotham officials said in their letter.  Analysts agreed that the Gotham offer appears to be better than the bids made by Goldman and the Zell group.  Shareholders do not want to get diluted here,  said Arnold Kastenbaum, an analyst with M.J. Whitman & Co.  They're finally getting to the point where they can realize value by becoming the owners and sharing in the appreciation of the Center.   Analysts believe that the Gotham offer may force Goldman or Zell to sweeten their offer. Officials at those two firms yesterday declined comment or could not be reached.  Up until now the Zell group, which also includes General Electric and Merrill Lynch, appeared to be winning the battle. It had signed a deal with the trust's board of directors which last week concluded that the Goldman bid was not any better.  But the shareholders ultimately must approve the board's action and Gotham's letter indicates that the Zell deal does not have the votes it would need. Smaller shareholders also said yesterday that they believe the Gotham offer is the best one so far.   It seems at first glance to be a much better deal than the one Zell is proposing,  said Orin McCluskey, whose investment firm owns 50,000 shares in the trust.  The trust, which itself has some $800 million in debt, needs a cash infusion of more than $100 million soon to pay debt service and expenses related to the takeover of the Center. Both the Goldman and Zell plans would provide this money but at a large dilution cost.  Under Gotham's offering, shareholders would get two rights to buy stock at $5.50 a share for every five shares they own. The trust's stock rose 12 cents, closing at $7.50 a share yesterday.  The trust was formed in the mid-1980s when the Rockefeller family wanted to extract cash from its ownership of the 12-building complex. Numerous individuals bought shares thinking they were becoming partners with the Rockefellers. In fact, they were clobbered when the city's real estate market collapsed and shares in the trust, which originally traded at $20, fell to $5 a share.  Even if Gotham's offers succeeds, both Goldman and Zell will come out big winners. Zell will be paid a $11 million breakup fee. Goldman, which has numerous rights to buy stock as the trust's largest creditor, will wind up with 20% of the new company that would own Rockefeller Center.   Regardless of what happens, Zell and Goldman will profit,  Kastenbaum said. Summary: A group of 15 wealthy families has jumped into the fight for Rockefeller Center with a plan aimed at knocking out two high-profile rivals that until now have dominated the battle. The group, Gotham Partners, proposed yesterday that the real estate investment trust that now holds the mortgage on the New York landmark raise $105 million by selling new stock to existing shareholders in order to gain control of the entire center.

It is gratifying to observe that they bear the strongest testimony to the activity and ability of our Surgeon-General, Dr. HAMMOND. The temporary deficiency of medical stores for the wounded at Centerville was due to the capture of the depot by the enemy -- for which the Medical Department is not in any way responsible.   We started from Washington with our wagons laden with sanitary stores on Saturday evening and reached the line our army at the foot of Centreville Hills, at 4 o'clock next morning, (Sunday, August 31st). It was a ride of only thirty miles, but we were delayed by the trains and crowds that were. moving in both directions. At the summit of the hill, just this side of Centreville, I came upon a train of fifty or sixty ambulances stationed in the rear of one of the old rebel redoubts, the enemy's shells being expected every moment. On communicating with the surgeons on the ground, and with the wounded, I learned that there was its a lamentable lack of medical and sanitary stores, the supplies having been cut off by the raids of the enemy. Forty-two wagons laden with medical stores had been capture at Manassas Many of our wounded soldiers had been without food for two days, and were soon to start for Alexandria and Washington over a rough and stony road, at the mercy of the merciless and insubordinate ambulance drivers. My wagon-loads of crackers and of pure and honest stimulants were soon cheering the eyes and comforting the exhausted nerves of many. Some were arranged on the narrow couch of the ambulance, others lying on the wet ground with no covering above them or rubber cloths under them, waiting their turn, or looking anxiously to the nearest ambulance as to a haven of rest.  As the field of battle of Saturday was in the hands of the enemy, it was not possible, without much delay, to carry out the original plan of reaching the wounded still there, and it was the opinion that I would not be permitted to enter the lines of the enemy. The need of stores at Centreville and in the very streets (where surgical operations were going on, and the wounded lying about,) was so apparent that there was no question as to present duty. Most of the houses of that dilapidated village were already occupied as hospitals, and a room was not to be had. I therefore appropriated an old hay-rack and a section of the rough sidewalk for my depot, and my boxes were soon arranged and opened. I had conferred with the Medical Director and with others of the Medical Corps, as they were hurrying through the town to and from their camps, so that a wise disposal of the supplies soon became a work of time only. Pressing inquiries came from all sides;  Have you stimulants, have you bandages, lint, dressings, splints, sponges, food, anything for the wounded?  And when my affirmative included beef tea, chocolate and condensed milk, you will appreciate the effect. The  interest of the occasion  was heightened by the fact that the street was crowded with wagon trains, regiments, stragglers, wounded, etc., and my depot generally regarded as a sutler's stand -- the' consequence being that I was besieged by the rank and file in very unmilitary confusion to sell much of what I had, and more of what I had not. Of the latter, tobacco, I think, took the lead.  One melancholy question was asked me;  Have you any chloroform?  No stimulants and no chloroform at the headquarters of our army, thirty miles from the unfinished dome of the Capitol! Such are the accidents of war.  Not knowing how our return might be delayed, I retained a few eatables, which were readily disposed of the next morning, before reaching Alexandria, to the wounded and wearied men by the roadside. I wished myself master of a train of Sanitary stores. We were able to take back with us some of the wounded.  It was the only enjoyment of the day to see how well, and as a matter of every day business, the Surgeon-General was providing for the wounded. He started; 5,000 convalescents for Northern hospitals, and in 36 hours every one of them is gone, and with a mattress under him. He got an order for 2,000 beds for the Capitol and 1,000 for the upper floor of the Patent office, and secured thirty or forty churches and dwelling-houses -- among them CORCORAN's, on Lafayette-square -- for hospitals. He sent for his best army Surgeons who were North, and to Boston, New-York and Philadelphia for sixty more picked citizen volunteers. His accumulation of supplies enables these hospitals to be organized quickly and with little embarrassment.  Summary: We are authorized publish the following exracts from letters received from members of the sanitary Commission, now actively employed in Washington and its neighborhood.",

NYSE Chairman Richard Grasso's newly shaved head turned heads yesterday when he showed up at 9:30 a.m. for the opening bell.  Grasso got his nothing-on-top cut between Wednesday night when he appeared at a news conference with Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt and Nasdaq chief Frank Zarb and yesterday morning.  The 52-year-old Queens native who runs the world's largest stock exchange wouldn't talk about his coiffure. Officially, the NYSE wouldn't discuss it.   If you're asking me about a haircut, it must be a slow news day,  said NYSE spokesman Ray Pellecchia.  It was the second time in a week that the respected exchange chief made news with untraditional behavior.  A few days ago, Grasso traveled to South America to meet with fatigue-wearing members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. Grasso said he made the trip, arranged by the Colombian government, to demonstrate the support of the financial community for democracy efforts in that country.  And in recent months, Grasso has staged many wacky photo ops to help celebrate new NYSE listings. In April, he joined  Frasier  star Kelsey Grammer and Viacom boss Sumner Redstone in getting  slimed  with the green goo used on Nickelodeon kids' shows.  Wall Streeters generally gave Grasso a thumbs up for risking a hip haircut in a conservative crowd.   It was bold and radical of him,  said Gary Book,39, a consultant in the Financial District.  He is probably trying to compete with the Nasdaq by being on the cutting edge.   Still, many couldn't believe he had taken the leap.   Good for him,  said one trader.  He's a normal guy.    It would make him look shorter,  one passerby said.  The NYSE chief's shiny dome had floor traders and brokers buzzing  Hey, check out Grasso's head  but in front of the exchange, most were mum.

The once-funky Colorado hamlet long ago became caked with glitz. There are so many fashion shows and gallery openings, people nearly forget to ski. Yes, the Kennedys have deserted the place in the wake of Michael Kennedy's tragic death in 1998. But plenty of others are spending their New Year's Eve there.  Among those decorating the slopes this season are Mel Gibson and family, Don Johnson and wife Kelley, Diana Ross, Anne Archer, Robert Wagner and Jill St. John. Meg Ryan turned heads as she tramped through the lobby of the St. Regis in her bathrobe and flip-flops - on her way to the hotel's spa.  Kevin Costner and his 26-year-old girlfriend, Christine Baumgartner, are everywhere. The other day, the couple lunched at the Aspen Mountain Club (checking out Dennis Basso's furs). That night, they hit the Fendi-sponsored benefit for the Aspen Art Museum. Afterward, they inspected David La Chapelle's whimsical nudes at a dinner at the Baldwin Gallery. They capped the evening with some nuzzling at the Caribou Club.  Goldie Hawn and daughter Kate Hudson have not let the little matter of Kate's wedding tonight deter them from their shopping. Goldie picked out a mink hat at Helen Yarmak's boutique while Kate opted for Gucci. Elsewhere, Meryl Streep hit Brioni and Louis Vuitton.  People are still talking about the Washington crowd that gathered at financier Ted Forstmann's recent Aspen powwow. Secretary of State-designate Colin Powell impressed hotel bellhops with his banter and gratuity. Less beloved by baggage handlers was Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, who allegedly tipped zip. Must be the tight-money policy.  Angelina Jolie should be an eyeful when she brings animated  Tomb Raider  heroine Lara Croft to life on the big screen.  Costume designer Lindy Hemming says Jolie has  13 different costumes.  00c2 Some of them are as little as a towel.   Jolie whipped her bod into supervixen shape with three months of rigorous training.   I'm all for curves on a woman, and feeling sexy,  Jolie tells Electronic Gaming Monthly.  And I'm hoping that everybody will enjoy it as well.   But even Lara Croft might have trouble pleasing Jolie's hubby, Billy Bob Thornton, in the nighttime. Thornton declares in the new Esquire:  Did you ever look at a woman when she's asleep and think, 'Who the [bleep] is that?' 00c2 You can kind of see her face, and she looks like a [bleeping] monster? And much of the daytime, you're, like, 'Oh, honey, I love you. Are you okay?' But when she's asleep, that's how you really feel about her.  Has he considered separate bedrooms, we wonder?  More kindling for rumors that Julia Roberts and Benjamin Bratt are inching toward the altar. Designer Matthew Williamson crowed at a Vogue magazine party recently that the Pretty Woman is  my No. 1 fan and she wants to meet me so I can make her a special dress. She is being very secretive about what she wants, but I'm going to make her something very special. I'd absolutely love to make her a wedding gown.   Roberts' spokeswoman tells us the actress has one of Williamson's sweaters, but has  never met or spoken to him. She's not getting married.   Koo Stark, the former soft-core starlet who once dated Prince Andrew, has been having a lively holiday.  Stark told London police on Christmas Eve that ex-boyfriend American banker Warren Walker struck her on the arm at his Notting Hill home, according to the Daily Mail.  A Scotland Yard spokesman confirmed that Stark filed a complaint, which  did not substantiate the allegations. The matter is now closed as far as we're concerned.   Walker and Stark have clashed over custody of their 3-year-old, Tatiana. Now a photographer based in Florida, Stark filed a $60 million breach-of-promise suit last May in Manhattan Supreme Court, where she alleged that Walker called off their wedding when he found out she was pregnant.  Walker has argued he never promised marriage and that Stark is using their love child to  obtain absurd sums from me.   Vanity Fair columnist Christopher Hitchens is kicking sand on Time magazine movie critic Richard Schickel. Schickel recently wrote a snippy review for the L.A. Times of  Vanity Fair's Hollywood,  the magazine's lavish bound collection of star portraits.  Calling it  a bulky book, hard to hold for very long on your lap,  Schickel sniffed that the  chipper, vapid captions  were not worthy of the  usually cranky Christopher Hitchens.   Biting back, Hitchens has written to the Times:  If you can't find an intellectually tough reviewer, could you not at least look for a physically robust one? Failing that, might you not supply him with a stout table that will support both his elbows and the pages you are paying him to turn? The weight of a book and the lightness of a reviewer should not be so poorly matched, or perhaps I mean proportioned.   Responds Schickel:  Ahh, that's more like it: The Christopher Hitchens whom we love somewhat more than we loathe - funny, flailing, outrageous. Where was he when 'Vanity Fair's Hollywood' really needed him?   CUBA GOODING JR., Yankee Chuck Knoblauch, retired hoopster Jayson Williams and former MTV veejay Eric Nies are the hosts at Noel Ashman's Studio 54.  00c2  DEREK JETER, model Carmen Kass and designer Betsey Johnson are on the list at NV on Spring St. ...  XZIBIT AND Fragma will perform at Joey Morrissey's all-night dance-a-thon at The World, WWF's Times Square nightclub.  00c2  MAYFLOWER MADAM Sydney Biddle Barrows and husband Darnay Hoffman are due for dinner at Rockefeller Center's Alfredo of Rome. Joining them will be biographer C. David Heymann, now working on the story of Travis Butler, the 9-year-old boy who lived with his mother's corpse for 33 days.  DAVID SCHWIMMER and girlfriend Mili Avital shared a drink at APT in the West Village this week.  00c2  EVEN WHEN they're off-duty, Radio City's Rockettes keep on dancing. About 30 of the Champagne-fueled hoofers kicked up their heels at Club One51 Wednesday.  00c2  GOLF FIEND Samuel L. Jackson bought two warmup suits for some friends at Mason's Tennis Mart on E. 53rd St. ...  JIMMY SMITS' grand Christmas Eve feast?

            "input": "text:Vacation is a time to relax, or a time to seek out adventure. It 2019s a way to let go of your stress and live out your fantasies. That is, if the stress and pain of planning the vacation doesn 2019t kill you first.  Whether you want to relax on the beaches of Hawaii, roam the English countryside, or visit the temples of Thailand, you 2019ve got to be informed, organized, and ready for what lies ahead. To that end, social and web tools can help. From utilizing wikis for collaborative planning to using social networks to share the YouTube videos you record, social media is a useful partner in experiencing the best vacation possible. This short guide highlights some tips, tools, and advice on how to use the social graph to plan and execute the perfect excursion.  The first step whenever you are planning to travel is to do your research! Research is key to choosing a location, picking a hotel, and figuring out where you should visit. One of the best ways to get good information is to read the insight provided by others. This is where social media can play a vital role to getting the best information possible.  While there are hundreds of social media websites you can visit for information, here are recommendations to get you started:  Nextstop: Nextstop, which we recently reviewed, provides a ton of simple-to-understand, user-generated guides for getting the most out of any locale.  Where I 2019ve Been: Not only is Where I 2019ve Been a popular Facebook application, but it 2019s also a stand-alone social network as well. Use it to get in-depth information on different.  Wikitravel: Perhaps the largest collection of user-generated travel information on the web, Wikitravel provides good information on where to go, what to expect, and even information on the culture.  TripAdvisor: One of the best-known sites in travel, TripAdvisor has millions of reviews that will help you pick out the gems and avoid the disasters.  The key is to look at a wide range user-generated content and reviews to get an overall picture. For more detailed information and social tools for research, check out our article HOW TO: Use Social Media for Travel Research.  Picking a vacation spot might just be the easiest part of the battle. Tackling the daunting task of planning, organizing, and building a vacation plan can be the stumbling block that makes the excursion fall apart. Yet social and web tools are ideal for saving this information, creating itineraries, and sharing them with others. There are a couple of things you can do to help make the collaboration easier.  First, if you 2019re going on a vacation larger than just your family, then you 2019ll want to collect everyone 2019s research and thoughts onto one page. Setting up a wiki for the vacation is a great solution for this issue. It will help make sure nobody 2019s ideas are lost. Set up one at Wikidot, PBWorks, Wikia, or Wetpaint. Want a simpler option? Then Google Docs may be a fit as well.  Planning a vacation should not be a solo effort. Working with a spouse, the kids, and friends not only lightens the work load, but makes the vacation a greater shared experience. Make collaboration a painless process by using time-based tools like Google Calendar and CalendarHub, both of which can remind you when tasks are due. TripIt is also ideal.  Finally, remember that Facebook, MySpace, and comprehensive social networks are an easy way to keep a group of friends in the loop about a vacation. Create a new event or a group for the vacation and post updates via the wall or send messages to everyone in the group. This can be a lifesaver when you need to collect things like signatures, opinions, or vacation funds.  Social media 2019s usefulness in vacation planning doesn 2019t end when you step off the plane. Even the best-planned (or impromptu) vacation will require adjustments. Here are a few tips and tools for when you need to find a great restaurant on-the-ground or are looking for advice from locals:  Go mobile: iPhone and Android apps are your friends. Having GPS-enabled and informative applications while on-the-go can mean the difference between finding the great treasures of Italy or getting lost in the alleys of Brazil. Be sure to check about data plans in the area you 2019re visiting  2013 you don 2019t want to pay enormous roaming and data fees after all.  Some apps need online access, while others will work regardless. So even if the phone is off, there are a great deal of applications that can make life easy. We suggest having ZAGAT TO GO, MapsBuddy, and Yelp [iTunes links] handy to start.  Check tweets in the area: Did you know that Twitter search has location-based search? Say you want to find out about parties near Paris. Just search  201cparty near:Paris 201d and you 2019ll have a set of local results. Refine as you 2019d like. Reach out if you 2019re adventurous.  Another idea: use Tweetie 2019s local tweets function to find residents who may be willing to help. Just be sure not to tweet to unsavory characters.  Use location-based social networks: Location-based social networks, while still fresh and new, are a great way to find friends and friendly strangers around you. Check out Loopt and BrightKite and see if either will work for you.  Tools like Flickr, YouTube, and a personal blog should be key partners in your vacation plan. Specifically, use these tools to store the memories of your trip for posterity. Creating albums of your adventures helps encompass the memory and can be referenced for years to come. A personal blog chronicling the trip can also be fun to write.  Don 2019t forget to share your multimedia with your friends and family, as well. You know they will ask, so make it easy for them to find it by posting the photos and links via your top social networks.  Hopefully with all of the tools and information highlighted in this short guide, you will have a no-stress vacation that you can remember for the rest of your days.  -11 Essential iPhone Apps for a Road Trip  - HOW TO: Use Social Media for Travel Research  - HOW TO: Find Your Way Around Any New City  - HOLIDAY SURVIVAL GUIDE: 20+ Tools for Family Travel  - How to Turn Your Business Trip into a Social Media Experience  Image courtesy of iStockphoto, apomares Summary: Vacation is a time to relax, or a time to seek out adventure.

            "input": "text:Regardless of who puts their stamp on the ultra-cheap tablet, OLPC's biggest task may be getting the various components in line. A typical fragile, glass LCD screen hardly seems a wise choice in the hands of young children, or in countries with unpredictable and scarce electricity. So OLPC hopes to incorporate plastic back-plane components, possibly from Mountain View, Calif.-based Plastic Logic, that would be far more durable. The tablet will also likely use ultra low-power screens from start-up Pixel Qi with both reflective and LCD capabilities, created by former Negroponte disciple Mary Lou Jepsen.  If Behar's design comes to fruition, the XO-3 will feature a camera on the back of the device and a finger-hold ring on the computer's corner. That loop, a metal cable that runs from the device's rim and is encased in the same rubber as the screen frame, can be used to steady the computer in the user's hand or to let it hang at one's side. Magnets in the loop could also be used to keep it tucked behind the machine, out of the way.  Those simple additions are the only departures from the tablet's minimalist design: Ideally, the machine won't even have a charging port. Behar says OLPC wants to use induction to wirelessly charge the battery through its rubber frame.  We wanted to remove all the scars that you typically see on a laptop from Lenovo or HP,  he says.  While the tablet isn't slated to appear until 2012, OLPC has other plans in the meantime. An incremental upgrade of the XO set for release in January will have several times the memory, storage and processing power of the current machine. The next upgrade, in 2011, will boost the machine's performance again and replace its AMD chip with a lower-power processor from phone chip maker Marvell.  When it comes to his plans for the $75 dream tablet, however, Negroponte admits his track record of lofty promises doesn't offer much assurance that this latest fantasy machine will appear. But he warns the computer industry not to underestimate OLPC.  Sure, if I were a commercial entity coming to you for investment, and I'd made the projections I had in the past, you wouldn't invest again,  he says.  But we're not a commercial operation. If we only achieve half of what we're setting out to do, it could have very big consequences.

As it turns out, Harbaugh handled his one-hour Super Bowl Media Day duty in much the same way he handles most news conferences: He gave cordial non-answers to questions he didn't like, constantly credited his players and offered a few memorable sound bites.  For example, his thoughts on social media?   My personal opinion is, it's a time drain,  Harbaugh said.  A lot of time is used on the Facebooking and the Tweeter and things like that. It seems unnecessary, though. It just seems like a modern-day diary.   Harbaugh, of course, was peppered with questions about coaching against his brother, Baltimore's John Harbaugh, on Sunday. The queries ranged from their boyhood brawls to, in true media-day fashion, his potential concern that John could read his mind.   No,  Harbaugh said.  Worried about a lot of things, but I have not noticed that he has any clairvoyant powers.   Asked another question about his brother later, Harbaugh turned the focus to his team with Shakespearean flair, quoting a  Henry V  line also used in  Band of Brothers.    There's no question that it's very exciting playing against my brother, John,  Harbaugh said.  The thing I also think about is the San Francisco 49ers, our players. They're my brothers. For he who sheds his blood with me today shall be my brother. I feel that about our players, I felt that and still do about our Stanford players and our USD (University of San Diego) players. This is their time. This game is about them playing with their brothers.   Meanwhile, quarterback Colin Kaepernick, like his coach, stayed in form in the face of the media barrage. Described as  a man of enough words  by Harbaugh this season, Kaepernick rarely added any unnecessary syllables for the flotilla of cameras.  What makes a good read-option quarterback? Kaepernick broke it down succinctly:  You need to be able to run and you need to be able to read the defense,  he offered.  Asked if he would remain in the pocket more against Baltimore's defense, however, Kaepernick did provide a memorable quote.   If I was worried about my health,  he said,  I wouldn't be playing football.   Eric Branch is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

It could prove a worthy successor to the lovely Honda Beat of the early 90s, a kei roadster that made use of every last drop of its modest 63bhp (and which even Clarkson praised in his  big hair  era). That said, the original Beat had a simple five-speed manual, while the presence of steering wheel paddles and absence of gearstick would suggest the S660 gets an auto box. Shame.  Even so, we 2019re looking forward to a closer poke around the S660 at the Tokyo show. Are we witnessing a brave new era of small, modestly powered, relevant sports cars? Summary: The breezy kei car study, which packs a 660cc engine, is headed for the Tokyo Motor Show in November.",

            "input": "text:A highly public spat has broken out between members of Boston 2019s startup community and the organizers of a conference Wednesday in Dedham that charges new entrepreneurs and other attendees for access to venture investors.  The war of words began when youngStartup Ventures, a New York firm that stages business conferences around the country, organized the New England Venture Summit, taking place at Hilton Boston Dedham, that costs as much as $1,095 for attendees to hear tips from more than 40 venture capitalists.  That kind of cover charge rubbed many techies in Boston the wrong way. So much so that they are staging their own event at the same time, in Kendall Square Wednesday afternoon. Called Unpitch Boston, the event has 30 local venture capitalists volunteering to mix among young entrepreneurs  2014 and it 2019s entirely free. (Boston Globe columnist Scott Kirsner is among the organizers of the Unpitch event.)   201cEntrepreneurs should never pay to pitch, 201d said Philip Beauregard, chief executive officer of Boston startup Objective Logistics and an organizer of the Unpitch event.  201cThese are literally people who can 2019t afford to buy lunch. 201d  YoungStartup Ventures did not return a call seeking comment, but it defended the conference on its blog by saying it is providing a much-needed service for early stage companies to find funding. The company said its business is similar to many other such conferences around the country, and moreover the group is coaching startup workers on how best to woo potential investors.  In response to the criticism of the Boston event, one event organizer said that by discouraging youngStartup Ventures  201cfrom producing programs, you are actually damaging the ecosystem and doing startups a huge disservice. 201d  The daylong Dedham event will involve startup founders pitching their companies, panel discussions on the latest technology trends, and networking among investors and entrepreneurs. Among the venture firms scheduled to appear are Birchmere Ventures, Covidien Ventures, and Excel Venture Management.  Beauregard and other members of Boston 2019s startup community have used social media, especially Twitter, to discourage local entrepreneurs from attending the youngStartup Ventures event.  Though the company has held numerous venture summits in the Boston area, this year 2019s event seems to have struck a particular nerve within the local tech community.  For example, youngStartup Ventures initially advertised that its New England summit would include a partner from the hot local venture capital firm Spark Capital  2014 even though Spark had not agreed to take part.  That elicited an angry retort on Twitter from Spark Capital investor Alex Finkelstein:  201cEntrepreneurs, don 2019t attend New England VC Summit, scam artist charging companies to present and claiming VCs will be there who 100% won 2019t. 201d  Finkelstein said the organization was also using his name to promote other events around the country.  The current list of speakers on the New England summit website does not include Finkelstein or Spark as a presenter at the Dedham event.  Though paid conferences with expert presenters are a staple of many industries, the issue of paying for access to investors has been the subject of much debate in the technology hotbeds of Boston and Silicon Valley.  Members of the Boston tech community appeared to take particular aim at youngStartup Ventures after several entrepreneurs complained about its past events here, and the issue of  201cpaying to pitch 201d gained new prominence via Twitter.  But one entrepreneur who does not mind paying the youngStartup fee is Rod Massey, a maker of mobile apps from Nashville.  Massey recently attended a youngStartup event in New York and will be in Dedham Wednesday.   201cIt gives us the ability to have access to VCs and investors, but also to receive coaching and guidance about the message we are delivering, 201d said Massey, whose company, iCitizen Corp., produces apps designed to increase civic engagement.   201cThere are certainly other venues where you can practice your pitch, 201d Massey said.  201cBut the amount that we 2019re talking about is a small amount in the scheme of things if you look at the value of what you 2019re doing or achieving. 201d  But the hometown crowd is not buying it, as they banded together in just a few weeks to put together the Unpitch event. One of the presenters at Unpitch will be Alex Finkelstein from Spark Capital.

            "input": "text:Pawel Pawlikowski has never followed convention. The Polish-born, Oxford-educated director first gained attention in the early  201990s, with several offbeat documentaries for British television, then earned critical acclaim for his debut feature,  201cLast Resort 201d (2000). He followed that up with  201cMy Summer of Love 201d (2004) starring a then-unknown Emily Blunt. After a lukewarm reception to his Paris-set  201cThe Woman in the Fifth 201d (2011), Pawlikowski returns to maverick form with  201cIda. 201d Set in 1962 Poland, it 2019s about two women, Wanda (Agata Kulesza), a cynical prosecutor, and her niece, Anna Ida (Agata Trzebuchowska), who 2019s about to take her vows as a nun. But before she does, she meets her aunt for the first time and the two embark on a journey to find out what happened to their family during the Nazi occupation. The film has been well received critically and commercially since it screened at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival. It opens here Friday.   201cWhat surprised me most was the big turnout in Paris. That had never happened to me, 201d says Pawlikowski over the telephone from New York. Over the course of his career, he says, his most personal films have turned out to be his biggest successes.  201cI made a documentary [ 201cFrom Moscow to Pietushki 201d] in 1989 about an unknown poet. It was a freewheeling, strange documentary that I made just for me and for my father, who had just died. It won several awards. It 2019s a strange thing; audiences seem to respond when I go out on a limb completely. 201d   201cIda, 201d with its stark black-and-white photography, single long takes and minimal dialogue, was Pawlikowski going out on a limb because he 2019d become  201cbored with the cinema. 201d   201cI thought,  2018I can 2019t watch movies anymore. 2019 All its weapons, all its tricks, the grammar of it, all the tracking shots, the music, the cutting, the noise. I knew I wanted to have strong photography, because then you don 2019t need a lot of close-ups or hand-held cameras. You can convey emotion in a wide, static shot if you do it well. I wanted to do each scene in practically one shot. I wanted to make a film that didn 2019t feel like storytelling, although there 2019s a story. But it 2019s more of a meditation. You watch it in a certain state of mind  2014 if you stay and watch it. I knew it wasn 2019t going to be a widely seen film, but it might turn out to be my most widely seen film. So there you go. 201d  Born in Warsaw in 1957, Pawlikowski left Poland in 1971, at 14, to stay with his mother in England after she remarried.  201cI couldn 2019t go back to Poland as I had left illegally and was only allowed back in to visit in the late  201970s, 201d he says. By 1980 he was allowed to return; and went back often after the fall of the Berlin Wall, in 1989. But he 2019d never shot a film there.   201cIda, 201d he says, is his attempt to depict the early- 201960s Poland of his boyhood memories.  201cIt was an important period in Polish history; culturally, when censorship weakened, Stalinism faded away, and a tiny margin of freedom was grabbed with both hands by a young generation who started playing great jazz music and writing books that were not imitative of any other culture. Polish culture at that time was at its most interesting, which often happens with authoritarian cultures, because all that was pent-up just explodes. I made this film in the same  2018I don 2019t give a damn 2019 spirit. I wanted to make a film that doesn 2019t imitate anything, doesn 2019t pander, doesn 2019t try to cover issues. It was a challenge to enter that spirit with both anarchic and disciplined filmmaking. 201d  Pawlikowski 2019s four-feature oeuvre is filled with complicated women, or girls, in the case of  201cMy Summer of Love. 201d It was that film that first impressed Trzebuchowska, who is currently finishing her bachelor of arts degree at the University of Warsaw.   201cI saw  2018My Summer of Love 2019 as a teenager and it made a huge impression on me. I really liked this weird and mysterious relationship between the girls, 201d Trzebuchowska says in an e-mail interview.  201cAfter  2018Ida 2019 came to an end, I decided to watch  2018My Summer of Love 2019 again, and it turned out that I still have the same feelings about it. 201d  It was Polish director Malgorzata Szumowska who first spotted Trzebuchowska in a Warsaw cafe.   201cWe were sitting in the same cafe and Malgorzata took a picture of me, which I didn 2019t notice, and sent it to Pawel, 201d recalls Trzebuchowska.  201cThen she contacted the production office, where I shot one short scene from the script. After a while I met Pawel. We talked, did some rehearsals and, as it turned out, it was the beginning. It seemed so incredible that I didn 2019t even have time to think if I would manage. Things like that do not happen every day. I trusted Pawel and believed he knew what he was doing. 201d  The heart of the film is the relationship between jaded, worldly Wanda and young, sheltered Ida, whose luminous presence underscores the film 2019s themes of guilt and innocence, saint and sinner, earthy and ethereal.   201cWanda is not a sentimental character; there 2019s no pathos, 201d says Pawlikowski.  201cShe had a heroic life as a revolutionary, but after 1956, communism started looking like a joke. They are both women of faith, but Wanda 2019s faith has stopped carrying her. Ida is a woman of God. She is not a common creature. There are not many people like that: Irregardless of religion, they have that and don 2019t need the world so much. 201d Summary: In  201cIda, 201d set in Poland in 1962, director Pawel Pawlikowsky returns to maverick form.",

            "input": "text:FORTUNE  2014 Earlier this morning, there appeared to be two finalists for the Yahoo YHOO CEO job: Interim CEO Ross Levinsohn and Hulu boss Jason Kilar.  But now there is only one, as Hulu just issued the following statement:   201cAs has been reported, Jason Kilar has been a focus of the Yahoo CEO search committee. He has graciously declined to be considered. 201d  First, let 2019s leave aside the obvious silliness of someone declining to be considered. Pretty sure that 2019s not really something you can decline. For example, I 2019m considering Albert Pujols for my company softball team. Come on Albert, try to stop me.  So what exactly does Hulu mean? Here are a few options:  1. Kilar just doesn 2019t want the job. He 2019s happy at Hulu. You know, the company that reportedly spurned Yahoo 2019s $2 billion acquisition offer last year. At least he knows the business issues he faces, rather than diving into what many believe is a bottomless pool of despair.  2. Kilar wants the job but saw the writing on the wall. This is the face-saving option. Popular sentiment is that Levinsohn has done a good job since taking over for Scott Thompson, including today 2019s news that Yahoo has settled its patent dispute with Facebook FB . Moreover, he is the company 2019s third CEO in the past 12 months. Can the rank-and-file really handle a fourth change in leadership? Maybe Kilar came to these realizations late, and is trying to make someone else 2019s decision look like his own.  3. Kilar is still in the running. This is the double-secret recruitment theory. Kilar is still CEO of Hulu, and few companies do well upon hearing that their fearless leader is looking to switch teams. So he officially pulls out, but keeps back channels open. If he gets an offer from Yahoo, then he sheepishly tells the Hulu troops that he tried telling Yahoo no, but then received an offer that he couldn 2019t refuse.  You got an alternate theory?

            "input": "text:Ten years ago, I called anyone buying into Google 2019s much hyped IPO a  201csucker. 201d My bottom line, which I helpfully broke out into a separate paragraph titled  201cMy Advice 201d in my Money magazine article was  201cstay clear. 201d Man was I wrong.  In fact, few investing calls, since the beginning of time, have been more wrong. Leading economist Irving Fisher calling stocks cheap in 1929. And then there 2019s me.  Google 2019s shares started trading at $50, adjusted for a 2-for-1 split a few years later. I said they were worth less than half that, around $20. And I was pretty sure they would soon nosedive to that price. They never did.  A decade later, Google 2019s shares now trade for $586. That 2019s a 1084% return, roughly 10 times what the stock market did at the same time. If you had invested $10,000 in Google GOOG then, you would now have $118,400, or $97,000 more than what you would had if you invested the same money in the S&P 500. You 2019re welcome!  So why was I so utterly wrong about Google? Can I learn anything about investing from this call?  More from Money: The 8 worst things ever said about Google as an investment  First of all, trying to come up with an exact price for what a company is worth is the true sucker 2019s game. To come up with my $20 a share for Google, I used what Wall Streeters and finance professors call a discounted cash flow model. And I sought out the advice of New York University economics professor Aswath Damodaran, who wrote a textbook about how to value companies, to do it. Estimate all the money you think a company is going to generate over the next decade (because try to estimate beyond that and you are bound to look pretty silly), and then figure out what, based on future inflation, that cash flow would be worth today. And presto, you will know what Google, or any company should be worth.  Ok, so there were a number of ways to mess this up, and I did all of them. My first mistake was to assume that Google 2019s sales growth would be a stable 30% a year. Online advertising was increasing, and I figured Google would get a slice of that. What I didn 2019t understand was that Google wouldn 2019t just get a slice, but nearly all of it. As a result, Google 2019s revenue has grown an average of 50% a year over the past decade.  Also, I thought there was a high probability that I was overestimating how profitable Google could be. I said there was a strong possibility that Google would end up with Netscape in the internet graveyard. Based on its current profitability, I said Google could earn $48 billion over its lifetime. But that, I said, was unlikely. What 2019s more, inflation would eat up the value of a lot of those profits. So I used a discount rate of 15%, per year, to figure out that the value of those profits was more like $15 billion.  Not even close. Google 2019s actual cash flow over the past decade has been just over $90 billion, and inflation has been basically non-existent.  If I had gotten that number correct, and trusted it, I still wouldn 2019t have predicted that Google 2019s shares would be near $600 by 2014. But I would have thought the stock was a buy back at $50.  Second, some companies do live up to their hype. Actually, probably more than most of us expect. Damodaran, who I called up to chat about our decade old folly, said not to be so down on trying to value companies. He thinks you will be wrong 20% of the time. That seems low to me. A number of companies that I thought were successes a decade ago have faltered. But I can 2019t think of eight high profile busts.  The companies that are still around a decade from now will probably perform better than expected. So the better question is not what the company will earn over the next ten years, but will it be around ten years from now. And then just assume if it is, it will do much better than you expect.  More from Money: 10 Ways Google Has Changed the World  Lastly, the companies that succeed are always going to be worth more than you think they are worth. That 2019s the nature of the stock market. We 2019re all chasing the same few stocks. And the market moves in herds. We think of the market and all the buying and selling as a way to come at the exact price a company is worth. That 2019s the efficient market hypothesis. Instead, the market for stocks works like any other market. The good stuff always costs more than you think it should. And the bad stuff is always overpriced.  Bruce Greenwald, Columbia 2019s reigning expert when it comes to investing, says I shouldn 2019t feel so bad about being so wrong about Google. A decade ago, the search business still seemed in flux. So again, I would have had to have known that Google wasn 2019t going away, and that it along with online advertising was going to take over the advertising world. In short, I had to know that Google was not just another Internet company, but the Internet company. I did not know that.  So here 2019s what I think I have learned: A decade ago, I thought price was the most important thing when it came to investing in stocks. That doesn 2019t seem right to me. The lesson of Google is that the most important thing when it comes to investing is picking the right companies. Get that right, and the price you pay for their shares is always going to be a good bet.  How do you know what companies will succeed? That leads me to my second, and more useful, lesson from my experience with Google: Buy index funds. I don 2019t know the future. Do you? And you kind of have to know the future really well to pick individual stocks. So don 2019t do it. Just buy the S&P 500. If the companies are successful, like Google, they will end up in the index eventually.  A few months after the IPO 2019s success, when Google 2019s stock had risen to the equivalent of $61, I again advised avoiding the stock. Instead, I said to buy eBay EBAY . Wrong, again. eBay 2019s stock is up a pathetic 17% since then. Although I also said to avoid the shares of Yahoo YHOO  2013a good call, but not enough to get me off the hook for the worst investment call of all time. Summary: A decade after Google's IPO, I revisit one of the worst investment calls of all time, and it was mine: Don't buy Google.",

            "input": "text:Bourgeois invasion: artist who gave Tate Modern legs brings new work to Britain  Ten new works by Louise Bourgeois, one of the most prolific and influential artists in the world today, will go on show in Britain this autumn.  Bourgeois, born in Paris and now living in New York, was the first artist commissioned to fill the Turbine Hall for the opening of Tate Modern in 2000, for which she created a giant steel spider entitled I Do, I Undo, I Redo.  The new works by the artist, aged 95, who takes inspiration from her childhood, will be unveiled in an exhibition at the Hauser & Wirth Colnaghi gallery, London, in October.  The show, which will go on display in the gallery's dramatic main room with its dark red silk walls, coincides with Bourgeois' first major UK retrospective, to be held at Tate Modern.  This will showcase more than 200 of Bourgeois' works, spanning the full range of mediums she has used: from latex to marble, tapestry to old underwear. It will include her seminal sculpture The Destruction of the Father, which has never been shown in the UK before. Alongside her larger works, such as her famous  cells  (cages constructed to contain installation pieces), will be cabinets containing her smaller, handmade figurines.  Hauser & Wirth will show six bronzes, two sculptures in fabric, a selection of works on paper and two huge vitrine works (sculptures encased in glass cabinets), which evoke Bourgeois' family business of tapestry restoration, and will feature the motif of the hand, which occurs again and again in her work. Gregor Muir, director of H&W, says:  Her pieces are timeless, brilliant and penetrating in the way she works her life into artistic form. She is one of the few living artists who straddle both modern and contemporary art.   Celebrities take on global warming  Can stars save the planet? A batch of celeb-fronted eco-documentaries is about to hit our screens. Leonardo DiCaprio has co-produced and co-written 11th Hour, in which he follows in Al Gore's footsteps to summon the great and good of the science world to discuss global warming. Meanwhile, Starbucks is promoting a film called Arctic Tale. With a script co-written by Al Gore's daughter Kristin, the film - narrated by hip-hop's Queen Latifah - follows the adventures of Nanu, a young polar bear cub, and Seela, a baby walrus. The soundtrack, including tracks by the Shins and Ben Harper, will be played at Starbucks shops. A spokesman for the chain says:  This is not about trying to drive more coffee business. We want to build awareness about the issue of climate change.   Will Okonedo do the Twist?  Filming starts next week on a new BBC production of Oliver Twist, to air in autumn, with Timothy Spall as Fagin. Still awaiting confirmation are Thomas Turgoose, the young star of Shane Meadows' film This is England, for the role of the Artful Dodger, and Sophie Okonedo, star of Hotel Rwanda, for Nancy.  Sweeney Todd cast eat all the pies  The smell of freshly baked pies will welcome visitors to the recently reopened Royal Festival Hall in the next few days. Welsh baritone Bryn Terfel and the rest of the cast of Stephen Sondheim's musical Sweeney Todd - in which the notorious  demon barber  serves up his victims in pies - will be gobbling more than two dozen similar  mystery  pies each night, made by local restaurant Canteen.

            "input": "text:It is a freezing afternoon with 13 shopping days to go before Christmas, and the gift shop at the V&A is bustling. The tills are ringing up posters and aprons, bracelets and brooches. In one corner, a pair of splendidly coiffed matrons pretend to be scandalised by an embroidered motto that reads  Folk Art, Let's Dance . A young girl gazes longingly at a pair of butterfly wellies. The surrounding galleries seem hushed, gloomy - and, yes, a bit empty. Over the past few years, museum shops have transformed themselves beyond recognition. Some of us might carry a little torch for the gift shop of old, a place to blow all your pocket money on a pen full of glitter, a plastic pendant and a rude postcard at the end of the school trip. But today's visitors are greeted by an altogether different proposition: a sophisticated retail experience involving paint-your-own-robot T-shirts, animatronic dinosaurs and replica crossbows. Galleries, schmalleries: these shops alone are worth the trip.  It is almost 20 years since the V&A was lambasted for branding itself as  an ace caff with quite a nice museum attached , and it's hard to imagine the same campaign (devised by the Saatchis, inevitably) causing such a stir today. Sarah Sevier, head of buying and product development at V&A Enterprises, admits that some shoppers - a tiny minority, of course - never get as far as the exhibits.   We know that we have a customer base that may not go to the rest of the museum,  she says.  We don't compare ourselves with other gallery shops. In terms of our positioning, we're looking more towards the high street, following seasonal changes and fashion trends.   Sharon Heal, editor of Museums Journal, agrees that the gallery shopping experience has expanded hugely.  If you tried, you could tick off your entire present list in the South Kensington museums. The nature of the museum visit has changed since free admission. People can now pop in for 10 or 15 minutes and come back time and time again.   National museums and art galleries are under greater pressure than ever from the government to generate their own income, and the need to focus on retail has produced some imaginative ideas. Products are often created in collaboration with artists; at their best (or worst, depending on your point of view), they blur the line between the shop and the gallery it serves. Selling everything from Rokeby Venus washbags to Canaletto ties, Andy Warhol oven gloves to Van Gogh earrings, the gallery shop is where the endless romance between art and commerce is joyfully (and affordably) consummated.  The financial contribution these shops make is considerable. The Tate - like the British Museum, the National Gallery and many others - has a separate company dedicated to creating a profit from the building's shops and cafes. Everything these companies make is covenanted back to their charitable parent museums, thus avoiding corporation tax. These contributions do not yet compare with public subsidy - the Tate's various shops accounted for 12% of its income last year - but the cash comes, crucially, without strings, and can be spent as gallery bosses see fit.  Of course, some artists are more suited to the checkout than others. Gilbert and George, for instance, adore merchandising; they collaborated enthusiastically with the Tate shop to market their 2007 exhibition.   They're very mischievous,  says Celia Clear, chief executive of Tate Enterprises.  We went to them not knowing whether they would want to do anything, and found that they already had masses of ideas. We had to hone them down until they were affordable - and not too rude.  This led to one of the year's merchandising must-haves, the Gilbert and George swearbox, along with collapsible wooden puppets, Rubik's cubes and sliding puzzles.  Louise Bourgeois and Peter Blake proved keen collaborators, with Blake helping the Tate shop create a make-your-own collage kit. But not everyone wishes to be so intensively marketed.  The older generation of artists just want their work to be seen as art,  says Clear.  They don't want to see it on a fridge magnet or a bag. In any case, some of them don't want to be seen as designers.   Nor would you catch the Tate selling a Mark Rothko beach towel. When the artist is dead, it becomes a question of finding something that is both in the spirit of the work and approved by the estate. (In the case of Rothko, this means simply selling prints and books.)  The biggest sellers at the major shops are usually the ones that reflect whichever blockbuster exhibition is on at the time. At the British Museum, replica terracotta warriors ( 00a320 each) are flying off the shelves, thanks to the First Emperor exhibition. But the exhibition cycle can be problematic for retailers, as the hottest buy often has the shortest shelf-life.  Typically, you've only got 12 weeks to sell it,  says Clear.  People can absolutely adore something on Sunday night, and then on Monday morning, it's a dead duck. A Millais scarf would have a has-been feeling the day after the exhibition.   So who is buying this stuff? According to Sevier, the V&A's shoppers break down into three broad categories. The first is the one-time visitor, looking for a souvenir. Then you have the frequent shopper:  They know our exhibition programmes well,  Sevier says.  They're looking for seasonal variation, they have good general awareness of the V&A, and they like to spend money.  Finally, there are the more expert patrons, who may even be involved in the museum business; they come to buy specific designer products or artistic works. Shoppers also vary according to the season, and the galleries adjust their merchandise accordingly. At Tate Modern, for instance, the summer collection is pitched more towards tourists who have come to admire the building as much as the art.  Museum shopkeepers don't like to be accused of frivolity, and make much of their dedication to authenticity and educational value.  It's not just pens, pencils and rubbers; we shouldn't be classed that way,  says Kate Channing, the British Museum Company's director of retail.  What we're doing is mirroring the fantastic wealth of the collections. If you took a magnifying glass to our replica Rosetta stone, you would be able to decipher the three scripts that unlocked the hieroglyphs. We pay a lot of attention to detail.   Speaking of fantastic wealth, the British Museum offers one or two gifts that would test the most capacious wallet. Best is a bronze head of Aphrodite, cast from a genuine Victorian mould, a snip at  00a31,950. But the most consistent sellers everywhere are the books and the good old-fashioned exhibition catalogues - a reassuring reminder that people do still go to galleries to look at the pictures. Summary: Our museums and galleries are busier than ever this holiday season. But is anyone actually looking at the art? Paul Arendt on the rise and rise of the gallery shop",

Photograph: State Russian Museum, St Petersburg  More than a blockbuster, this exhibition explores the relationship between French and Russian art during the 19th and early 20th century, and includes works from the major state museums in both Moscow and St Petersburg: killer Gauguins and impressionist works, C 00e9zanne, Matisse and Picasso, culminating with Malevich's Suprematist abstractions.   00b7 Royal Academy, London, Jan 26-April 18 (0870 848 8484).  With subjects ranging from his memories of a Canadian adolescence, skiing, drugs, road trips, movies, and life in Trinidad - where Scottish-born Doig now lives - and a technical breadth that keeps his art always on the move, this is the first mid-career survey of this influential and fascinating painter.   00b7 Tate Britain, London, Feb 5-April 27 (020-7887 8888).

On April 14, Sears SHLD will launch its new Now + Here shops in Sears stores and online, which the Chicago-based retailer touts as  201cfast fashion 201d shops that will keep customers  201con the pulse of fashion at affordable prices, 201d according to its release. It will offer  201cfashion tops, bottoms, cardigans and vests 201d  2014 yes, even vests.  It 2019s no secret that Sears needs a revenue infusion. For the 2013 fiscal year, it recorded a net loss of $1.4 billion. In the fourth quarter alone, the retailer lost $358 million, which is actually an improvement over the $489 million it lost in the fourth quarter of 2012. But going after the 18- to 34-year-old woman is a curious move for a retailer that 2019s likely better known for its appliances and tools than its fashion sense.  MORE: Brookstone 2019s bankruptcy woes don 2019t mean the mall 2019s dead  Then again, who wouldn 2019t try to win even a fraction of the global fast fashion market  2014 known for its ultra-trendy looks, near-disposable quality, and modest price tags? The fast fashion market has more than tripled in size since before the recession, according to Euromonitor, which measures the market by specialty apparel and footwear sales. In 2007, fast fashion sales totaled $41.6 billion. Last year they reached $124 billion.  European powerhouses H&M and Zara  2014 which have perfected the process of identifying clothing trends and delivering them to consumers quickly and cheaply  2014 dominate the global fast fashion scene. In 2007, Sweden 2019s H&M owned 1.3% of the specialty retail and footwear market; now it has the largest market share  2014 1.6%  2014 as its sales increased 62% in the past five years to $18.3 billion in 2013, Euromonitor says. Likewise, Spanish retailer Zara increased its market share from 0.9% to 1.2% in the five-year span, with sales surging 60% to $12.9 billion last year.  As a more traditional retailer trying to catch up, Sears is certainly not alone. For instance, when teen retailer Abercrombie & Fitch ANF announced in February that its fourth-quarter same-store sales shrank 8%, CEO Mike Jeffries emphasized that the company would focus on improving its women 2019s fashions and increasing style differentiation, all at a lower cost.  What 2019s fueled the current fast fashion frenzy is the more discerning, penny-pinched consumer, who 2019s now shopping for apparel the way she shops for everything else: based on immediate need. As the recession constricted consumers 2019 discretionary spending, and as the global reach of the Internet accelerated fashion trends, the everyday shopper started buying clothing that she could wear now instead of shopping for the coming season, says Marshal Cohen, a chief industry analyst at The NPD Group.  201cI don 2019t care who you are, no one is buying a swimsuit in February anymore, 201d he says.  The increasing immediacy of fashion is a challenge for traditional retailers that typically decide what they 2019ll hang on their racks six to nine months ahead of time. Fast fashion retailers, meanwhile, have programmed their supply chains to work six to 10 weeks in advance, which allows them to follow trends more closely.  MORE: In battling German unions, will Amazon emulate Wal-Mart?  Succeeding in fast fashion isn 2019t easy; it depends on three things, says Ashma Kunde, a retail analyst for Euromonitor: quickly bringing clothes to market, identifying and capitalizing on trends, and affordability. Sears promises its Now + Here apparel will range from $20 to $42, but whether it can deliver on speed and style remains to be seen. Sears has been working to speed up its supply chain for some time now, according to Nick Grayston, president of apparel at Sears. Positive responses to a test run of Now + Here 2019s monthly deliveries last fall prompted the larger roll-out of the shops, Grayston said in an email, adding that the company 2019s roster of designers and buyers in San Francisco and New York will be able to  201cquickly assess market trends to get them into the hands of our members while they 2019re still hot. 201d  Also looming over Sears 2019 fast fashion launch is how the store will coax teens and twenty- and thirtysomethings through its doors in a crowded U.S. market. Forever 21 is the U.S. 2019s longest fast fashion resident, Kunde says, but H&M, Zara, and newcomers like online retailer ASOS have upped the competition.  201cWhat 2019s going to make [Sears] stand out? 201d Kunde says.  201cThe market 2019s at the point where you can 2019t rely on the basics anymore because everyone 2019s doing that. 201d Grayston, for his part, says that Sears 2019 shop-in-shop concept has helped attract a new type of customer since it enhances the shopping experience with signage, fixtures, and mannequins that communicate  201ca distinct brand point of view. 201d  Luckily for Sears, in addition to being frugal and demanding, today 2019s fast fashion consumers are tremendously disloyal. They care about what the clothes look like, not which stores sell them.  201cIf you have a really great product at the right time, it 2019ll spread like wildfire. All it takes is a couple of wins, 201d Cohen says. But that theory comes with a flip side: As quickly as fast fashion brands enter the market, he says, they can disappear. Summary: The struggling retailer is introducing its Now + Here shop in stores and online in an attempt to capture a piece of the growing fast fashion market.",

Although, Eric Schmidt 2019s role as  201cAdult Supervisor 201d has been joked about, the stability he brought to the company did hold some intrinsic value. Not only is he leaving as the most popular Tech CEO with his employees, he was a grounding force for Google 2019s more outlandish founders.

Chrysler and Twitter both will benefit from the strength of other initial stock offerings in their sectors over the last year or so and the overall IPO market 2019s strength.   201cWhether there is uncertainty in Europe or Fed tapering, all that matters is whether returns are positive in the IPO market  2014 and they are now. Strong post-IPO returns are the key factor, 201d says Kathleen R. Smith, a principal with IPO investment advisor Renaissance Capital. The firm 2019s data shows some recent IPOs are up 50%, with the average above 25%.  The U.S. IPO market may be bouncing back to levels last seen in 2007, with a stream of about 110 offerings lined up in biotech, technology, and consumer goods. That doesn 2019t count the 75 or so deals like Twitter that will use the JOBS Act to get into the public market.  MORE: The IPO market is on fire!   201cBarring an external shock, the IPO market is likely to be strong this fall. There 2019s plenty of money around and the specter of the Facebook (FB) and Zynga (ZNGA) IPO debacles is fading, 201d says Erik Gordon, a business professor at University of Michigan.  The IPO market is benefiting from an increased appetite for risk, says Josef Schuster, who heads an IPO research firm that manages an index fund based on 100 recent IPOs. The First Trust U.S.IPO Fund ETF FPX is up 33.4% so far this year, vs. 30.2% for small growth funds tracked by Morningstar and 24% to 25% growth for mid-sized funds.  Some of the market is fueled by the smaller IPOs coming out under streamlined and  201csecret 201d share registration allowed under the JOBS Act of 2012. Under the JOBS Act, companies with less than $1 billion in revenues are allowed to submit their going-public paperwork confidentially, an approach used by about two-thirds of eligible companies, according to a Latham & Watkins analysis posted on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission website. The law includes other accommodations for smaller faster growing companies, such as only disclosing two years of audited financial results, instead of three years that 2019s generally required. About half of them are technology companies, with energy, health care, and real estate also plentiful, Latham reported. Some 85% of them had revenue of $250 million or less.  The second quarter was the most active one for IPOs since the financial crisis, and by mid-August, the total U.S. IPOs had already exceeded the 2012 total, Renaissance Capital reported.  Overall, tech firms  2014 along with Noodles and Co. ndls and Sprouts Farmers Market sfm , a natural grocery store chain  2014 have shown the biggest first-day returns this year, according to Renaissance Capital 2019s IPO data.  Most investors will compare Chrysler not to Twitter but to it its peers in the auto sector that went public in the last two years, says Renaissance 2019s Smith. Those are supplier Delphi Automotive DLPH , which went public in November 2011 and whose shares up up 50% year to date, and GM gm , whose shares are up 27% year to date.  Twitter will be measured against Facebook, whose stock is up 17% from its starting gate, and LinkedIn, which is up 455% since its debut in May 2011.

Many other IPOs in the pipeline follow that dichotomy: Hilton Hotels, Claire 2019s shops, and RE Max are old-school companies going public. Tech security firm Fire Eye and Chegg, which provides e-textbook rentals and online homework assistance, are among the new economy offerings.

Entrepreneurs completely disappointed with the lack of attention they 2019ve received from their seed investors and, as a result, choosing to either try to keep them out of their Series A rounds or minimize their participation. Most have received pro-rata rights as part of their seed investment, so sometimes this becomes a negotiation  2013 again, clearly evidence that these entrepreneurs are indeed telling the truth on this subject as their seed investors try to negotiate for more participation in the Series A.

            "input": "text:HOPEDALE, Mass., April 25 2014 The only thing typical about this Cadillac of company-owned mill towns is that, like more than half of the state's communities, it has relatively quietly, and with relatively little pain, put into effect the stringent financial controls required to meet new limitations on taxing and spending.  For some of the state's 351 cities and towns, the requirement of a statewide referendum that property taxes decrease in stages until they equal no more than 2 1 2 percent of fair market value has caused deep strains and cries of civic anguish.  Statewide surveys indicate that the consequences of the referendum may include as many as 20,000 layoffs by July 1, the beginning of the fiscal year, including 9,000 teachers,1,400 firefighters and 1,300 police officers. Gov. Edward J. King has called those estimates ''saber-rattling,'' but in the town of Milton, local officials are talking about closing two of three fire stations. Quincy may have to dismiss 500 of its 1,600 school employees. Cambridge may have to eliminate 30 of its 195 police officers.  But in Hopedale and about 200 other communities, the reductions have already been made for the next fiscal year, without major incident or difficulty.  ''Now that we've done it and it's over, it wasn't all that bad and maybe it was the best thing that could have happened to us,'' said Bernard Stock, who serves as Water Commissioner, Sewer Commissioner, Federal training program director and administrative coordinator of this community of 3,900 residents about 35 miles southwest of Boston.  In Hopedale, the restrictions on property taxes will lead to a 15 percent reduction in spending next year from this year's level of $3.1 million, about 25 percent less than what a ''business as usual'' increased budget for next year would have been.  Some items in the town budget were cut only slightly. School expenses, for example, were reduced 11 percent. Many items were substantially reduced and a handful were eliminated, such as the full-time fire department and the parks department.  Some amenities were eliminated, such as the summer band concerts for which the town paid $1,680 a year. Others were made selfsupporting, like the publication of the annual list of residents, now available for $1 a copy instead of being free. Some functions were turned over to civic organizations. 34 Jobs Eliminated  But 34 of the town's 134 jobs were eliminated, either by attrition or by layoffs of long-time employees. ''You can't say we've done it entirely without pain, because many of the people let go were very good and sincere and loyal employees who had worked here all their lives,'' Mr. Stock said.  ''There were things we were doing because people liked them or because no one questioned them and because there was never any reason not to do them,'' he said. ''Then all of a sudden the town meeting had to make a choice of what they really considered important. We never had to do that before.''  In Massachusetts even more than in other states, the rapidly rising cost of local government has been financed mainly through local property taxes. Spending by local governments is 12 percent above the national average, while property taxes account for 81 percent more of per-capita income than the national average, according to Barbara Anderson, chairman of the citizens group that put the measure on the ballot last fall. She said her conclusions were made on the basis of a study of taxes in 1979 done by the Associated Industries of Massachusetts, a business group.  She said that, after more than a decade of steadily increasing spending at a time of slow economic growth, the overall tax burden on state residents had risen to 23 percent above the national average. From 1960 to 1970 it was at or just above the national average.  Census information bears out her statements. In per capita taxation in 1978-79, Massachusetts ranked second, behind Alaska, at $545.97, and the national average was $295.07. New York, for example, ranked fifth, with per-capita tax of $481.89 in that period. If taxes are figured per $1000 of personal income, the national average for that period is $38, the Massachusetts average $69, and the New York average $58. Spending Was Out of Hand  In Massachusetts, the problem was compounded as local government came increasingly to operate under rules that critics say encouraged spending, eliminated fiscal controls and strengthened the hand of special interest groups while weakening the ability of taxpayers to resist their demands. In many cases voters were forbidden by law to say no to increased spending.  That pattern appears to be ending now as the state's communities for the first time in memory are forced to work within a budget, rather than being allowed to raise the tax rate to cover whatever they wanted to spend.  But the new 2 1 2 percent tax level mandated by law will still leave property taxes here well over the national rate of 1 1 2 percent.  The effects of spending reductions have been hard to accept in Hopedale in part because of the town's history as a paternalistically run community. It was owned outright for more than 120 years by the Draper family, manufacturers of textile machinery, who set a pattern of spending whatever needed to be spent to produce the best factory town in the nation. Town Loses Its Factory  Much of that was eliminated years ago, the family sold the business in 1975 and the factory was closed last year. But people here had come to expect low-cost, high-quality community services.  But now cuts have had to be made. The school system will have 80 employees next year, he said, down from 104 this year. Class sizes will increase from 22 to about 30. Junior varsity sports and postseason games have been eliminated. Two of the system's four school buses have been sold and pupils living closer than two miles to schools will be responsible for their own transportation.  Donald Hayes, the superintendent of Hopedale's 775-pupil school system, said the town is ''on the road to the end of an independent small quality school system.'' Local Schools Preferred  Hopedale residents have repeatedly turned down proposals to merge their tiny school system with those of nearby towns into a more costefficient regional system because they value the sense of community a school system creates.  For the nine members of Hopedale's spit-and-polish, full-time professional fire department, the plans to shift to a hybrid department of volunteers and professionals are hard to accept.  The annual town meeting earlier this month voted for the change by secret ballot after hearing arguments that the department was a luxury the town could no longer afford. Nearby towns, many of them much larger, have similar hybrid systems with no apparent ill effects. The change would save Hopedale about $61,0, about 2 percent of its current budget.  ''It's like a kick in the pants after 31 years of devoted duty,'' said Herbert Durgin, chief of the department, who is to be laid off along with three or four other firefighters in July.

The group has dedicated itself not only to performing the best works available of this generally difficult genre, but also, more importantly, to performing them with a virtuosity that few other new-music ensembles even approach.  Last night's concert at Alice Tully Hall, the first of three to be given there this season, showed that Speculum Musicae has lost none of its dedication or its virtuosity. With a composer's name or a date changed here or there, the program was one that might well have been presented a decade ago or more. No one is going to accuse Speculum Musicae of trendiness or bandwagon-jumping.  There was, for instance, Irving Fine's Fantasia for String Trio (1957), a fairly conventional but on the whole elegant work in a Neo-Classic mold that has worn better than many a more celebrated piece of its period. It held attention better, at any rate, than Paul Alan Levi's ''The Truth,'' a 1975 piece in which a soprano, Sheila Schonbrun, declaimed verses by Randall Jarrell about a boy whose mother has lied to him about the death of his father in the war. Predictably couched in an angular Expressionist idiom that offered no surprises, musically or dramatically, the work rose at best to little gushes of anguish but did not add much to the rather prosaic text itself.  Donald Palma conducted in the staid style that the music seemed to require. Mr. Levy made some attempt to forge instrumental drama out of an opposition between the chamber ensemble and a harpsichord that was supposed, we were told, to represent the boy's feeble struggles to assert himself in the callous adult world. It was a fine argument for the abolition of program notes.  No explanatory notes accompanied Earl Kim's Monologues for Violin, Cello and Piano (1967), perhaps because the music was too transparent for words. The three instruments, positioned in a triangle and widely separated, each played fragmentary solo passages, never overlapping or touching a unison until the work's final moments. The result, while possibly of some stereophonic interest on a recording, was timid and emotionally attenuated music whose point was not at all clear.  The evening's novelties were chamber-orchestra versions of Ligeti's ''Melodien'' (1971) and Schoenberg's Five Pieces for Orchestra (1909). Neither work made quite the impression it can in its full orchestration, but in both performances the essence of the music came through clearly.  The Ligeti, conducted by Joseph Passaro, was one of the works in which the Hungarian composer broke with the Serial orthodoxy of the time, in favor of drones, slowly evolving melodic lines and juxtaposed but independent melodies. In spite of its cleverly interlocked metrical schemes, the effect is of immobility.  Hearing the Schoenberg on the same program forced one to recognize how well the Viennese composer had anticipated Ligeti's static effects, particularly in the third of the Five Pieces, ''Summer Morning by the Lake.'' Schoenberg's method was basically chordal in this piece, while Ligeti's was contrapuntal, but both achieved a motionless, shimmering quality that some young composers today are finding attractive.  The Schoenberg arrangement, for 12 players, was made by Felix Greissle in collaboration with the composer. David Gilbert conducted it with expansive gestures and a vigor that made one wish he had the full orchestra of the original Opus 16 at his disposal. The Program SPECULUM MUSICAE, At Alice Tully Hall.

By KATE MOODY  For all the recent changes in telecommunications technology, most notably cable, not much has been done to structure the new media or to ensure innovative programming for the young. ''Five years ago cable promised us a rose garden - in terms of children's programming,'' said Peggy Charren, president of Action for Children's Television, at its first national symposium on children and television this past spring. ''We still consider it a promise - with lots of potential and problems.''  One of the problems was pointed out in the keynote address at the symposium by Representative Edward J. Markey (D-Conn.) and a member of the House subcommittee on telecommunications: ''We are seeing the beginning of a telecommunications goldrush in which many private businessmen are more interested in maximizing profits than in serving individuals.'' Referring to children, he said, ''They are being written off (because) they have no money, no clout and they don't vote.''  In recent months, hearings before the Federal Communications Commission on children and television have been halted, millions in funding to public broadcasting -long an oasis of commercial-free programming for children - has been slashed, and the only daily commercial network program for young children, ''Captain Kangaroo,'' has been cut from 60 to 30 minutes.  Part of the promise of cable is that it can provide a diversity of programming and services to young audiences in a way that broadcast television never has. With their multiplicity of channels, cable operators are not constricted, as broadcasters are, by a need to serve the largest audience with the largest buying power. Without the burden of having to appeal to a mass audience, cable can provide a variety of non-commercial services.  There have been a few notable efforts to shape the medium to meet the needs of children. For instance, Sun Prairie, Wis., has mandated by city ordinance a children's cable televison channel. To date, it is the only community in the country to have done so. There, 8- to 13-year-olds are involved in all aspects of producing and programming for their own channel, which is called ''Kids 4.'' The existence of such a channel results not only in television programs but in new educational processes. In one major project, the children organized a study of the history of their town, which had never before been presented in an easily accessible form. They researched and drew a map of historical places, which was then published in the local newspaper. They presented a public performance of historical moments and recorded it on video-tape, and now they are editing the material into a one-hour video production, ''Historical Moments in Sun Prairie.''  Another model community cable project, the Miami Valley Cable TV Council, in southwestern Ohio, has developed a low-budget, two-way cable television system whereby viewers in two communities can respond on the screen to what they are watching on television. The council, acting as a consortium for several surrounding towns, inaugurated an ''institutional loop'' phase of service with an interactive program involving eight area colleges and seven local schools. During a ''teleconference,'' a panel of college representatives at the community-access studio in Miami Valley discussed college life. Return signals from participating high schools enabled students to appear on screen to ask questions. The teleconference utilizes an institutional loop (a special cable) strung among government buildings, the schools and the access center.  The council petitioned the board of trustees to allocate a healtheducation channel for the interconnected communities. Regular use of this channel began early this year with the debut of the ''Discover Health'' series. Funded by the Inter-Agency Council on Health (I-ACHE), the series already includes ''Look Before You Eat,'' a program about diet; ''Growing Up Young,'' about teen-age sexuality; ''Woman-Child,'' about teen pregnancy, and ''Lupus and Its Treatment.''  ACT, based in Newtonville, Mass., has spoken up on behalf of the children of Boston and its suburbs, asking Mayor Kevin White and the city's cable commission to provide the following services and programming for young viewers:  * Children's channels with quality, age-specific programs offered at hours when children typically watch television;  * Locally produced shows for children, which could offer school plays, local sports, government activities, arts and cultural events, including programs for racial and linguistic minorities and the handicapped;  * Access channels to give adolescents as well as preteen-ager youngsters an outlet for expressing themselves;  * Commercial-free service to children in which neither productmessages nor host sellers are used;  * Lock-out systems that permit parents the option of barring from their home certain programs they may deem inappropriate; Summary: --------------------------------------------------------------------  Kate Moody is the author of ''Growing Up on Television.''

            "input": "text:H0 By PETER G. DAVIS  Has the musical theater ever produced a body of work more resilient and indestructible than the Gilbert and Sullivan operettas? If more proof were needed to substantiate this claim, we now have before us the original-cast recording of the New York Shakespeare Festival's ''The Pirates of Penzance,'' a production that is no doubt sending G&S purists into paroxysms of fury (Elektra VE 601, two disks). Pop singers and a rock band, indeed. Worse yet, this soupedup edition has been packing audiences into the Uris Theater all winter long. What ever happened to the hallowed Savoyard traditions handed down from generation to generation?  In point of fact, the United States has never been much bothered by Gilbert and Sullivan traditions, ever since the ''Pinafore'' craze of 1879, when innumerable versions of that operetta were playing the length and breadth of the land. And, come to think of it, perhaps this is a good thing, too. Consider that bastion of G&S convention, the D'Oyly Carte Company, which has reverently preserved every bit of original business laid down by W.S. Gilbert a century ago, from the patter singer's raised left eyebrow to the tenor's dulcet expressions of modified rapture. The D'Oyly Carte productions have become so mummified in recent years that most Britishers have become completely soured on the subject of G&S. The company is apparently even threatened with extinction through lack of audience support. These operettas can withstand almost anything, it seems, except the stifling weight of their own traditions.  So for American Gilbert and Sullivan fans, Broadway's ''The Pirates of Penzance'' should hardly come as a jolt. A season rarely passes in New York without one company or another offering a revamped G&S operetta, aiming to bring it into line with contemporary tastes. A few months ago, for example, the Village Light Opera staged a space-age ''Princess Ida'' - a rather silly idea, perhaps, but no serious violence was perpetrated on the music or dialogue to undercut Gilbert's keen wit or Sullivan's ever fresh music. Much the same is true of the current ''Pirates,'' although there are several unsettling aural elements about the show that are emphasized on disk without the production's high-powered visual attractions to distract the ear. First, though, the good news.  Surely the smartest decision on the producers' part was to trust the strength of the operetta's basic material. Minor adjustments in the text, a few transpositions in key and two musical numbers inserted from other G&S works hardly amount to major tampering. This is still ''The Pirates of Penzance'' in all its important essentials, without updated dialogue, tricked-out melodic lines or reharmonizations (anyone remember ''The Hot Mikado'' of 1939?). There is even a nice musicological touch in the restoration of the original finale, which has probably gone unheard since the official world premiere in New York on New Year's Eve of 1879.  The first jarring note for ''Pirates'' aficionados will most likely be the sound of the orchestra, a 20-piece ensemble of winds, brass, percussion and keyboards. William Elliott's instrumentation necessarily replaces the graciously genteel Victorian sheen of Sullivan's orchestra with the raucous aggressiveness of a modern rock band. True, the hard, glassy glare of this stringless combination poses the threat of aural fatigue, but for this listener, who has heard too many ''authentic'' G&S performances played on ghastly upright pianos and Hammond organs, the notion of hearing Sullivan's music expressed in such a special context is not to be dismissed out of hand. Besides, Mr. Elliott's arrangements are so ingenious, so imaginative, so responsive to mood and so inherently musical, that objections simply evaporate before his virtuosity. Needless to say, the instruments sound infinitely better on disk without the tinny overamplification of the Uris Theater's sound system.  But now we reach the fatal flaw -the singers. The general level of vocal achievement on this ''Pirates of Penzance'' is about what might be expected from a high school G&S society. Part of the operetta's charm is its parody of grand-opera conventions, and the roles were written for real voices - in an ideal world only a cast of Joan Sutherland, Marilyn Horne, Placido Domingo and Nicolai Ghiaurov at their best could convey the effects that Sullivan was hoping for when he wrote out these operatic parts. The present Broadway cast can almost make one forget their vocal limitations when cavorting on stage, but not when they have to rely on voice alone to project the music. This is especially true of Kevin Kline as the Pirate King, a heady, swash-buckling physical presence in the theater, but reduced on disk to a pallid nonentity.  Even worse is Linda Ronstadt as Mabel. Possibly in the interest of vocal self-preservation, Miss Ronstadt gingerly mews her way through the music in live performance as any teen-ager with a pretty but untrained voice might do. In the recording studio, she has obviously decided to deliver the goods more generously, but this only accents the yawning gap between her low chesty pop voice and the disembodied falsetto she must resort to in this kind of music. She is constantly forced into making awkward gear changes from one production method to the other, and the effect is painfully embarrassing. Summary: H0 By PETER G.

            "input": "text:The heat was on Larry Christiansen in the 14th round of the United States Championship in South Bend, Ind. If he was to retain any chance to become one of the three qualifiers for the Interzonal competitions for world championship aspirants, he would have to defeat Samuel Reshevsky.  At 69, the grand old man of American chess had resisted all of his opponents' efforts to make him show his age: Lubomir Kavalek had pressed him to the wall in the 10th round, but Reshevsky held firm; Lev Alburt had tortured him for 69 moves in the eighth round, but he grimly drew a pawn-down end game. And there he was in the 14th round leading Christiansen by a half-point - and playing the white pieces as well.  Christiansen, at 24 the sharpest gambit player in American chess, chose the aggressive Benoni Defense, 2 . . .P-B4, in the hope of introducing complications that Reshevsky could not handle. There was no need to worry about 8 PxP because either 8 . . .PxP; 9 P-K5, PxP; 10 QxQ, RxQ; 11 NxP, N-Q4! or 8 . . .BxP; 9 0-0, N-B3; 10 B-B4, Q-N3!; 11 R-N1, QR-Q1 would give Black a good game.  Reshevsky could well afford to play 14 P-KR3, BxN; 14 QxB since an attempted refutation with 14 . . .N 3xQP? would have been put down by 15 NxN, NxN; 16 B-QN5!, winning the exchange by threatening both 17 BxR and 17 B-B6.  Reshevsky's bid to stymie Christiansen's attempted queenside attack with 21 P-QN4 was based on the consideration that 21 . . .PxNP; 22 RxP, PQR4; 23 R 4-N1, P-N5; 24 N-N5 would concede White active piece play in return for Black's protected passed QNP.  With 22 . . .PxP!?, Christiansen broke up his solid queenside pawn formation for the sake of obtaining dynamic piece play after 23 NxP, N-N4, a positional sacrifice that Reshevsky took him up on with 24 BxN, BxB; 25 BxP.  While Reshevsky's minor pieces were committed to the queenside, Christiansen thrust 26 . . .P-KR4 to set up the threat of 27 . . .P-R5 and 28 . . .Q-B5. Reshevsky should now have defended by 27 Q-KB3, QxQ; 28 PxQ, but Black's positional superiority would then have been worth at least the gambited pawn.  Instead, Reshevsky erred with 27 P-N3?!, P-R5; 28 P-B4?, overlooking that after 28 . . .PxP! he could not capture the bishop without permitting mate in two. The result, after 29 R-KB1, BxP, was that the old man had lost two pawns. Worse yet, the white king postion was ruined and Christiansen soon threw his entire force at it.

            "input": "text:Donald Trump, who announced his candidacy for the presidency Tuesday, is rich. Exactly how rich has been the subject of decades of debate and even a lawsuit.   201cThe real number is $10 billion, 201d Trump told Bloomberg at a June 3 meeting in his Fifth Avenue office, leaning over his paper-strewn desk. Or is it $8.7 billion, as stated in a document Trump published in conjunction with his announcement? Even at the lower figure, that would make him the 54th richest person in the US, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.  A billion here; a billion there. The fact that estimates of Trump 2019s fortune can vary that widely underscores how hard it is to determine just how much he 2019s worth. His own assessment for the Trump brand name, which is stamped on hotels, neckwear, cologne and bottled water and allows him to collect licensing fees, is in the billions. Trump is bullish on Trump futures.   201cNinety-nine million views, 201d he said, knocking over an employee 2019s computer monitor as he pointed to a YouTube video of rapper Mac Miller 2019s platinum-certified track,  201cDonald Trump, 201d playing on it.  201cNow that 2019s a brand. 201d  Unlike some other candidates, Trump has never filled out the personal financial disclosure form before. It could be fall before he files, if he applies for routinely granted deadline extensions.  As a celebrity property developer and promoter, Trump has no peers. He tends to describe all of his assets in superlatives: the greatest building, the finest golf course, the best locations. He also doesn 2019t publicly delineate between what he owns outright and properties he manages, making components of his fortune hard to pin down.  Most of his signature property, Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in New York, is comprised of condominium units and common elements 2014hallways, elevators 2014that have been sold and no longer hold value for Trump.  He owns the rights to the building 2019s commercial spaces, including twelve floors of offices and a three-story Gucci store at the building 2019s base. Those spaces are valued at about $400 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg using estimates of revenue, profit and capitalization rates.  He also owns the building 2019s 30,000 square-foot penthouse apartment. While the home could fetch a premium for its size and location, a buyer would probably want to renovate the gilded space.  Trump took out a $100 million mortgage on the tower in 2012, according to New York City property records.  Developers in locales as far flung as South Korea, Turkey, Panama, and Hawaii have paid Trump fees to put his name on buildings he neither constructed nor owns, with an aim to sell condos and hotel rooms for higher prices. The income supplements Trump 2019s other operations to fund new acquisitions and pay down debt. It 2019s unclear what sum, if any, these licensing rights could capture on the open market.  Another complication in this murky net worth exercise: Trump holds the leaseholds, but not the deeds, for at least two New York City properties. He purchased a 100-year leasehold in 1979 for 6 East 57th Street, which houses a Niketown store, according to property records. The agreement also granted him the air rights above the store, which he used to build Trump Tower, located right around the corner.  He paid an annual rent of $125,000 for the building through 2008. The following year, it jumped to six percent of the property 2019s fair market value, leaving room for Trump to negotiate his rent, said Charles McDowell, owner of London-based Charles McDowell Property Consultants. A 100-year-leasehold would sell for at least a 10 percent discount to its value, McDowell said.   201cRents have skyrocketed on the street, and this old lease is most likely less than $500 per square foot right now, even given renewals, 201d Faith Hope Consolo, chairman of retail brokerage at Douglas Elliman Real Estate, said. The leasehold has a value of at least $450 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Trump also has a leasehold agreement at 40 Wall Street, a 1.3 million-square-foot office tower in New York 2019s financial district. He purchased the lease, which expires in 2059, for $10 million in 1995, property records show. He could extend the lease through 2194.  Office space in the building rents for an average of about $45 per square foot, according to listings on its website. The leasehold is worth about $500 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. He secured a $160 million mortgage on the property in 2010, records show.  Trump 2019s resorts and 20 golf courses in the US, Scotland, and Puerto Rico are also difficult to value. Golf courses have a variety of revenue models, said Larry Hirsh, president of Golf Property Analysts, an appraisal and consulting firm. Some are designed to help sell nearby real estate and may operate at a loss.  They derive revenue from a mixture of greens fees, memberships and food and drink, each with different profit margins. Based on data compiled by Bloomberg, Trump 2019s courses could be worth more than $450 million.   201cThe Trump name has come to mean something in golf, 201d Hirsh said.  201cHe 2019s done a lot for the sport. 201d  There 2019s more: Trump owns 30 percent of two buildings majority-owned by Vornado Realty Trust  2014 at 555 California Street in San Francisco and 1290 Sixth Avenue in New York 2014that are worth a combined $640 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Clinton, Bush  Other big projects are probably worth less. He 2019s retained the rights to the commercial spaces at Trump Tower in Chicago, and opted in 2014 to expand its hotel lobby into what were originally meant to be revenue-generating retail spaces. And New York condominium buildings 2014Palace, Parc, Place and Plaza 2014hold little to no value after their units were sold.  Trump has 30 days after an announcement to file a listing of his assets 2014and liabilities 2014with the Federal Election Commission. He can seek two 45-day extensions, and those are granted routinely. That means it will be mid-October before Trump reaches the put-up or shut-up moment on giving the public a peek at his personal finances.  If he runs, Trump will be among the few candidates who have never disclosed their finances. Hillary Clinton, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Rick Perry have all either been federal office holders or candidates before. Others, including Jeb Bush, Chris Christie and Scott Walker, have released some financial information voluntarily or under state laws.  Even if Trump does complete a federal personal financial disclosure form, he won 2019t have to disclose everything about his finances: None of his homes, cars, boats and other personal property must be listed, unless they produce income. He also won 2019t have to show his tax returns or any assets that are held by his adult children. Summary: Donald Trump, who announced his candidacy for the presidency Tuesday, is rich. Exactly how rich has been the subject of decades of debate and even a lawsuit.",

Michael Gandolfi 2019s  201cAscending Light, 201d a major organ work commissioned by the Boston Symphony Orchestra and given its premiere at Symphony Hall last spring, is absent from the orchestra 2019s glittering summer schedule, in which many Boston programs are repeated  2014 even though Gandolfi attended the Tanglewood Music Center in 1986, and has headed its composition program for almost two decades. And the Music Shed 2019s sole concert dedicated to the organ this season will feature an electronic instrument: sheer anathema to windblown traditionalists.  In fact, it was the inferior tone of a pre-digital electric instrument that prompted Koussevitzky to acquire a pipe organ in the first place. It arrived just in time for the Music Center 2019s 1940 debut.  Possibly because of the high cost of retuning it after a Berkshires winter, the instrument is seldom played and few people are even aware of its existence. The pipes are shrouded by the stage 2019s acoustical reflecting panels; the console is parked backstage.  The instrument made a rare appearance in daylight on June 29, but only for a private audience. Five busloads from the Organ Historical Society 2019s national convention in Springfield were treated to a sampling of solo works by the BSO 2019s regular Boston instrumentalist, James David Christie, who heads the organ programs at Oberlin and Wellesley colleges.  If tradition holds the pipe organ to be  201cthe king of instruments, 201d then Tanglewood 2019s surely qualifies as a princeling: the godchild, so to speak, of E. Power Biggs, the English-born Bostonian who became one of the world 2019s most-renowned classical performers after the First World War.  Biggs (1906-77) had played so many guest appearances with the BSO that he styled himself the ensemble 2019s  201cofficial 201d organist. As Craig R. Whitney, formerly of The New York Times, wrote in  201cAll the Stops, 201d his 1993 book about American pipe organs, when Biggs heard about Koussevitzky 2019s disgust with plug-in electric instruments in 1939, he took the maestro to hear an experimental instrument that the Boston company Aeolian-Skinner had built to Biggs 2019s specifications.  On his European concert tours, he had reveled in the lighter, clearer, more romantic tone of German organs. That 2019s what Biggs got, and what Koussevitzky wanted.   201cFine, 201d said the autocratic maestro after the audition,  201csend it up to Tanglewood. 201d  That specific organ already had a home in a Cambridge museum. But with financial support from the Carnegie Foundation and Biggs serving as voicing consultant, Aeolian-Skinner had its new Opus 1002 ready for the first TMC season. For its initial performances that year, Biggs selected five Bach favorites  2014 the Fantasia and Fugue in G to open, the mighty Passacaglia and Fugue in C minor to close  2014 plus works by Vivaldi, Handel, Brahms, and one contemporary composer, Hindemith. The ubiquitous Saint-Saens  201cOrgan 201d Symphony, which had so dismayed Koussevitzky on an electric, didn 2019t make the cut.  Tony Fogg, the BSO artistic administrator, was asked the other day why Gandolfi 2019s new piece wasn 2019t on the BSO summer schedule.  201cIt 2019s too small, 201d he explained, referring to the resident organ.  Two keyboards, four divisions, 27 stops, 24 registers, 33 ranks, and 1,734 pipes aren 2019t big enough? But for context, when Aeolian-Skinner installed its Opus 1134 at Symphony Hall in 1949, it boasted four manuals, six divisions, 66 stops, 59 registers, 80 ranks, and 4,662 pipes  2014 much more scope for Gandolfi to play with.  Not coincidentally, Biggs 2019s hand is visible this season in the program the BSO presents on Friday, conducted by St 00e9phane Den 00e8ve and featuring international concert star Cameron Carpenter. During a European tour, Biggs was much taken by Francis Poulenc 2019s just-released Concerto for Organ, Strings, and Timpani (1938). It hadn 2019t been performed in the United States, so Biggs rounded up financing for its American premiere in a free concert at Harvard.  Carpenter will be featured in that work and the Saint-Saens symphony, playing on his year-old Marshall & Ogletree International Touring Organ. (He will also present a short solo recital after the main concert.) The instrument uses Linux-driven computer hardware to blend digital samples from Carpenter 2019s favorite cathedral and theater organs, emulating literally thousands of stops. Instead of pipes, the instrument employs loudspeakers.  With it, Carpenter recently told an interviewer for the Champaign-Urbana, Ill., newspaper the News-Gazette,  201cI can keep what 2019s best in the pipe organ  2014 its sounds, its spatial dynamics, its emotional impact  2014 and dispense with what I would argue holds it back: its immobility. 201d  And so, Koussevitzky 2019s dream for Tanglewood  2014 in which a much smaller instrument played a supporting role 75 years ago  2014 moves resoundingly (you might say) into the future.  At: Koussevitzky Music Shed, Tanglewood, Friday at 8:30 p.m. Summary: The Aeolian-Skinner organ built for Tanglewood and introduced in 1940 is not being celebrated during this anniversary season, but the ideals behind it remain.",

Saudi-led aircraft pounded Iran-allied Houthi militiamen and rebel army units in Yemen on Monday as a humanitarian crisis worsened.  While Yemen is not a major oil producer, Gulf producers ship oil along the Gulf of Aden on Yemen's southern coast and through the narrow straits of Bab el-Mandeb, between Yemen and Djibouti. The conflict raises the specter of a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia.  The number of active U.S. oil-drilling rigs has fallen for a record 20 weeks in a row to its lowest since 2010, according to data from oil services company Baker Hughes, fueling expectations production will drop.  But U.S. commercial crude inventories have risen for 15 straight weeks to a record 489 million barrels.   While the situation in Yemen and the falling U.S. rig count have supported, some caution remains because we have not seen evidence the cuts in drilling have translated into lower inventories,  said Gene McGillian, senior analyst at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.  Brent June crude was down 15 cents at $65.13 a barrel at 12:15 p.m. EDT (1615 GMT), having swung from $64.40 to $65.61.  U.S. June crude was up 30 cents at $57.45, having traded from $56.71 to $57.89.  Brent's premium to U.S. crude <CL-LCO1=R> pushed to $8.33 a barrel on Monday, but fell below $7 after it did not reach Friday's $8.43 a barrel peak.  Another sign of ample supply was news that Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi told officials in Beijing that the kingdom is ready to supply China with additional oil if required.   Sustaining the recent oil price rally requires firmer demand and a tangible supply response,  analysts at Barclays said in a research note.  Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch raised their oil forecast for Brent and U.S. crude, while voicing some caution about ample supply.   The market seems to have found a spot price low, and we lift our end of 2Q15 targets for WTI and Brent to $59 and $63 a barrel,  they said in a note.  We revise up our 2016 Brent forecasts to $62 from $58, but remain bearish relative to the forward due to the big oil overhang.

            "input": "text:Xiaomi even took first place in a report from China Mobile on new users in April, indicating popularity among first-time mobile adopters such as teenagers. The world's largest network provider said the Chinese upstart led with 1.75 million new units, while Samsung was fifth at 1.27 million units and Apple 11th at 297,000 units.  Given that Xiaomi began selling smartphones just three years ago, its rapid growth in the domestic market is impressive. One of the reasons for the rise is the company's strong relationship with customers, analysts said.  The Beijing-based firm only sells through e-commerce retailers and directly to consumers, which is not typical, ABI Research analyst Nick Spencer said in a statement.  Read MoreWhy US venture firms can't get rich in China  Xiaomi offers a limited number of devices for sale during flash sales, which for the last few weeks have occurred on Tuesdays at noon. Customers must make accounts on the site prior to purchasing and are limited to one of each device in order to prevent scalpers, according to the website's FAQ.  With this strategy, Xiaomi claims to have sold more than 10 million smartphones in China in the first quarter of 2014, on track to reach its annual target of 40 million units in 2014 and to become the fourth largest player in China, Forrester analyst Bryan Wang said.  Last year, Xiaomi missed its 20 million goal by 1.3 million, but sales were more than double that of 2012, according to ABI Research.  Low cost is another key factor for Xiaomi's growth. On Amazon.com's Chinese site, the iPhone 5s lists at almost $800, while the latest Xiaomi phone, MI 3, costs less than $300. Other Xiaomi models such as Redmi sell for just over $100.  Read MoreThis market's in a sweet spot thanks to Apple  Just as importantly, Spencer said that Xiaomi has a well-developed ecosystem. Its devices run a customized, Android-based system called MIUI, which the company claims to make $4.9 million a month in revenue from, Spencer said. Other, non-Xiaomi devices can also download versions of the software.   What makes Xiaomi interesting is that it has a software ecosystem play, and an innovative and highly effective marketing or user community strategy,  he said.  With its own messaging service, virtual currency, games and e-book platform, Xiaomi also reaches into the territory of Chinese tech conglomerates such as Tencent and Weibo. Add the company's cute rabbit mascots and highly active user forums that discuss everything Xiaomi from the latest devices to product interface, and there is little surprise that the firm has gained what many call a cult following.  However, the allure Xiaomi has in China may keep it from succeeding in the United States and elsewhere.   Xiaomi is a challenge in China and adjacent markets to Apple and Samsung, but its community-based strategy is hard to replicate beyond that,  Spencer said.  Still, since Hugo Barra left Android product management at Google to become vice president of Xiaomi Global last August, the company has been taking steps toward expansion overseas.  In a shift from the original name, which literally means  Little Rice  in Chinese, Xiaomi rebranded in April to the more universal-sounding  Mi.  Last month, the company also launched a website targeting India, adding to several other Asian branches outside of China.  But analysts said it will take a strong marketing plan and more unique devices to steal the spotlight from Apple and Samsung on the global stage. In particular, the carrier-dominated U.S. market will be hard to break into.  Xiaomi may have its own reasons for not wanting to venture far from its home base just yet.  They have not captured their whole market share there,  Blair said.  They're not anxious to jump out of China because they're still in the copycat mode. Samsung was in the copycat mode for a long time.   The private Chinese company, which ABI Research values at $10 billion, did not respond to requests for comment.  Samsung's slow rise to global success included 10 years of marketing campaigns in the United States, analysts said.   It's hard to imagine that Xiaomi could surpass Samsung,  said Wharton professor of marketing Z. John Zhang, who previously provided marketing training for the Korean company. He added that Xiaomi, founded in 2010,  is not really a big company yet. It is at a growth stage.   No analysts saw Xiaomi breaking into the Western market before 2015, but many count on its potential.  Read MoreHomegrown brands lead India's mobile revolution  During a trip to Taiwan last month, Blair said investors there mentioned the company in every conversation with him.

But he 2019s overmatched in his directing debut, the well-intentioned football biopic  201cMy All American. 201d  The bittersweet story of 1960s University of Texas shooting star Freddie Steinmark has the elements we 2019d expect from someone with Pizzo 2019s filmography: unabashed sentiment, infectious positivity, and enough game footage to leave even Bill Belichick bleary-eyed.

You won 2019t leave feeling inspirationally moved so much as depressed.  Things get off to a clunky start with legendary Texas coach Darrell Royal (unconvincingly aged Aaron Eckhart) reminiscing about how Steinmark was  201cmy All American, 201d official recognition notwithstanding. The movie finds its footing in rewinding several decades to Colorado Friday-night-lights territory, where popular, irrepressibly optimistic Freddie is sure this is the year his losing high school squad will turn it around. Shy, pretty Linda (Sarah Bolger,  201cOnce Upon a Time 201d) buys the various upbeat dreams he 2019s selling, and so does Bobby Mitchell (Rett Terrell), his physically gifted, initially cynical new teammate. Soon they 2019re all off to Austin, as undersize Freddie nabs a scholarship by making yet another believer out of Eckhart 2019s tough-but-accessible Royal (mercifully freed from the bad makeup).  Cut to training camp trials, coach-speak about the wishbone offense, quarterback controversy, and personal tribulations for Bobby. In short, there 2019s a lot going on besides more fully dimensionalizing Freddie 2019s character ahead of that ominous moment when  2014 uh-oh  2014 he winces and clutches his leg.  This mystery health issue comes to a head during an instant-classic matchup with Arkansas for the national title, as Royal reluctantly pulls struggling Freddie for another defensive back.

If you happen to have, say, UT superfan Matthew McConaughey 2019s level of passion for the Longhorns, you might be into it. Otherwise, you might wonder about some of Pizzo 2019s narrative play calling, and how much more profound our empathy could have been.

            "input": "text:The American radical thinker Hakim Bey coined the term  temporary autonomous zones  in the 80s to describe the often illegal makeshift communities that were being created in cities and remote rural areas by squatters, travellers and the various alternative communities living outside society's norms. The term now also applies to the many illegal urban communities  2013 made up mostly of migrant workers and their families  2013 that have sprung up in European cities over the past decade or so. Many have become semi-permanent settlements, existing almost invisibly on the edges of mainstream society.  The Italian photographer Alessandro Imbriaco borrowed the title Temporary Autonomous Zones for his five-year project about migrant communities scattered along the outskirts of Rome. Back then, he photographed these precarious places in a classic documentary style influenced by Walker Evans and Dorothea Lange's stark images of the Great Depression in 30s America.  Then, something happened almost by accident that shifted his style. Driving along a main road out of Rome, Imbriaco noticed a stretch of wasteland that looked like a swamp and, amid the trees, a makeshift wooden building. Intrigued, he went to investigate and bumped into a man from Sicily named Piero, who was living there with his family. So began an extraordinary journey, which led to The Garden, a strangely beautiful book about survival and belonging, exile and human resourcefulness.  The Garden foregoes a straight documentary style for an atmospheric one in which the sense of place is almost magical, even mythical. It is a dark book only in its use of colour  2013 often you have to look hard to spy the human figures in the woods. Given that Piero, his partner Lupa and their young daughter Angela live a life of hardship and marginalisation, the tightrope Imbriaco walks  2013 between representing their way of life and idealising it  2013 is a tricky one. He has said that he  wanted to put something of the feeling of Piero and the swamp into the story, something connected to me and my emotional response to the place .  It seems both Piero and Imbriaco are romantics at heart: the swamp becomes  the garden , the woods a shelter from the city that surrounds them; the child is a free spirit wandering though a leafy eden. The struggles and defeats that brought Piero and Lupa to this place are not alluded to, nor is there much evidence of the cold and damp, or the lack of home comforts that go hand in hand with life at poverty level. Instead, the emphasis is on their close-knit family life and their self-made home in this strange hinterland.  By jettisoning his usual documentary style for one that draws unabashedly on the Romantic tradition, Imbriaco challenges our preconceptions about this exiled family and their surroundings. He highlights the dignity, and great beauty, of such an uncertain existence. Angela undoubtedly has a closeness to nature that most children no longer experience.  (She) grew up like a child of 60 years ago,  notes Imbracio.  For this reason, she is very strong.  Revealingly, though, while Piero and Angela seem comfortable with the photographer's presence, Lupa shies away from his camera. There is only one portrait of her in the book, surrounded by foliage as if trying to disappear into the woods.  The Garden won the European Publisher's award for photography last year; it's not hard to see why. Taken in late-afternoon natural light, the photographs exude an otherworldly atmosphere that reflects the family's self-contained, and occasionally magical, existence on the literal and metaphorical edge of a modern European city. They possess a quiet, cumulative power that attests to Imbriaco's intimacy with his subjects and his admiration for their undoubted resilience.  It is a way of life that has since come to an end. Lupa and Angela now live in a shelter for women and children in the city so that Angela can attend school, as is legally required by the state. An outsider by temperament, Piero now lives in the swamp  2013 his garden  2013 alone.

An insider's glimpse of an epically dysfunctional family, it is shot through with deep affection and tenderness. Not for the faint-hearted or easily offended, but a rare chance to see a classic series of dirty realist photographs shot from the inside out.  At Ffotogallery, Cardiff, Borderliners offers a chance to see another more recent dirty-realist series: Rimaldas Viksraitis's Grimaces of the Weary Village, which is being shown alongside an older series, Rural Markets (1969-1987) by fellow Lithuanian photographer Aleksandras Macijauskas. The unifying theme is the post-Soviet decline of rural village communities in Lithuania. In a related event, both artists will be talking about their work on 16 February.

It was worn by his cornerman Bundini Brown at the famed  Rumble in the Jungle  fight against George Foreman in 1974.  Poignantly, in London where it became famous, there is also the  split-glove  that Ali wore, and broke, during his 1963 fight against Briton Henry Cooper at Wembley. Boxing legend has it that attending to the split meant that Ali had a little bit more time at the break to recover. He came out for the fifth round and won the contest.   It's one of the three most famous artifacts in Muhammad Ali's life, and probably the most famous pair of boxing gloves too,  says Miller.   The Brits have a particular affinity for Ali and he has also for the Brits. He has had a very long relationship with the British people going back to the first fight in 1963 here against Henry Cooper, right up to the present day.   There is a growing campaign, backed by British heavyweight David Haye for the star to be given an honorary knighthood. There are more than 20,000 signatures gathered so far on a petition.  Although he faced backlash in the U.S. for his stance on the Vietnam War,  the British didn't see it that way,  says Miller.  The rest of the world came to love him and he became a hero.   In interviews and through his well-known quips and often forthright views, he  speaks with quickness and wit and cleverness,  says Miller.  He stood up, and continues to stand up, for what he believed to be right.   . The exhibit opens March 4.

            "input": "text:It was called vulture investing. Sam Zell Sam Zell , the grave-dancer of the early 1990s, was an archetypal bird of prey, snatching at properties (often high-quality properties) as developers and owners struggled with lenders.  It was a great foundation for building the nation 2019s biggest publicly traded office-building collection. With Zell steering it through the most prosperous years commercial real estate has ever seen, Equity Office Properties Trust created a draft stream that pulled many other companies along behind it.  Greater transparency in a famously opaque business converged with global capital flows to set in motion the sale of Zell 2019s collection of former commercial carcasses, grown to gargantuan size and scope. More than 500 buildings totaling more than 100 million square feet comprised the record-smashing $39 billion privatization sale of Equity Office Properties to the Blackstone Group on Feb. 7.  Now, with barely a blink, a huge chunk of those same assets (many of which have been revivified and filled out with prime tenants over the years, but many others still marking unfulfilled promise) are about to be offered up and out to multiple layers of investors 2013vulture and otherwise.  The sale itself, which promised to offer a High Noon style of business entertainment following a hugely dramatic buildup to the biggest leveraged buyout in U.S. history, came down to a brief and not particularly eventful last meeting of EOP shareholders and shareholder proxies on Feb. 7 in Chicago.  In a small auditorium in the EOP-owned Civic Opera Building, EOP CEO Richard Kincaid Richard Kincaid (Chairman Zell was out of town) called the meeting to order. Kincaid ascertained that every stockholder who wanted to vote on the Blackstone Group 2019s most recent offer ($55.50 per share, cash) had done so, and then asked for the tabulation of votes to be read.  Roughly 77% of all shares voted, and 92% of those voted yes, meaning that about 71% of all outstanding shares voted to be acquired by Blackstone. And that was that. Kincaid declared the deal done, and the 16-year run of EOP was history. The deal is expected to close with breathtaking speed later this week or early next.  Of course, it was a done deal even before that; any potential drama had been sucked out of the event when EOP 2019s other suitor, Vornado Realty Trust , withdrew its most recent competing bid for Equity Office Properties just before the vote.   201cI 2019m not really surprised, 201d Kincaid said about Vornado 2019s decision in a press conference after the meeting. Blackstone 2019s offer, he added,  201cwas too high a hurdle, 201d suggesting that there would not have been enough profit left at a higher bid.  Vornado 2019s offer was actually a little larger than Blackstone 2019s 2013$56 per share 2013but it was a combo of cash and Vornado stock. With Blackstone 2019s all-cash-this-minute-no-messing-around offer, cash is king, and the prospect of no strings attached and no worries about Vornado 2019s stock fluctuations carried the day. While some analysts had argued that the structure of the Vornado offer was indeed more advantageous to EOP stockholders, neither EOP 2019s board nor the broader base of stockholders seems to have thought so.   201cWe 2019re confident we got full value, 201d said Kincaid. For its part, he added, Blackstone is getting an  201cirreplaceable portfolio. They 2019ll do well with it. There 2019s a lot of demand for office properties. 201d  Which is probably understating the case. Before the day was out, investors who had lined up like hungry guests at a combination buffet line and raffle were beginning to walk off with their plates full. The apparent early plate-glass door prize winner: Macklowe Properties, which was widely reported to be set to take down a $7 billion Manhattan portfolio, with buildings such as 717 Fifth Ave.; 1540 Broadway; 1095 Sixth Ave.; and the behemoth Worldwide Plaza, which EOP acquired in the mid-1990s from  2026 Blackstone.  It has been widely understood that Blackstone, which has only about a 10% equity stake in the transaction, would be selling off many of the properties it is acquiring almost immediately. And with its winning bid of $55.50 per share some 15% higher than its going-in offer of $48.50 from November, chances are that the sell-off will be even more aggressive than Blackstone had originally planned 2013especially if, as happened on Feb. 7, the 10-year Treasury continues to slide.  Indeed, it 2019s more than likely that Harry Macklowe himself already has an eager queue of partners waiting for their share of the spoils.  Will Vornado be one of those buying pieces of the late EOP from Blackstone? While some observers thought that likely, suggesting that the only reason VNO withdrew from a potential shareholder showdown was that it had reached a deal with Blackstone, others felt that the run-up to the vote may have left Blackstone chieftain Steve Schwartzman and VNO 2019s Chairman Steve Roth Steve Roth at odds. After all, it was Vornado 2019s intervention that forced Blackstone to pay up; however, the flip side (and we do mean flip) is that the properties became (demonstrably) that much more valuable through the competitive process.  Indeed, Vornado surely wanted the Manhattan buildings that Macklowe is getting, but sources say it also has its eye on EOP 2019s extensive Orange County, Calif., holdings. And investors overwhelmingly cheered VNO 2019s exit from the bidding war: The stock jumped nearly $9 on the day, from $127 to $135.75.  In a research report released early the day after Blackstone 2019s victory, Wachovia analyst Christopher Haley wrote that the move was  201ca clear fundamental and technical positive; we believe VNO 2019s $3 billion-plus of marginal investment capacity will generate higher ROAs than the $20 billion-plus of EOP-allocated capital, and possibly sooner. 201d  In other words, money well unspent.

It would be equally tough to find one issue that could somehow, miraculously, unite all fans, everywhere.

Despite its utterly prosaic name, the First AFL-NFL World Championship Game, in Los Angeles on Jan. 15,1967, remains a thrilling benchmark for fans not only because it was, in fact, the first-ever Super Bowl, but because of the jaw-dropping number of future Hall of Famers  2014 and gridiron legends who never made it to Canton  2014 who played, coached or were simply associated in one way or another with the event. The American Football League 2019s Kansas City Chiefs, for example, featured Len Dawson, Emmitt Thomas, Bobby Bell, Buck Buchanan and long-time coach (of the Chiefs as well as the team 2019s previous incarnation, the Dallas Texans), Hank Stram.  The NFL champion Green Bay Packers, meanwhile, boasted the likes of Bart Starr, Ray Nitschke, Herb Adderley, Forrest Gregg, Willie Davis, Henry Jordan, Jim Taylor and Willie Wood. (Another Packer great, running back Paul Hornung, suited up for the game but did not play, having been injured earlier in the season.) Finally, Green Bay was coached by none other than Vince Lombardi, subsequently immortalized in the big game 2019s ultimate symbol: the big, silver Vince Lombardi Trophy.  The Packers won the first Super Bowl in 1967  2014 the only Super Bowl that did not sell out  2014 handily beating the Chiefs 35-10. Bart Starr was named the game 2019s Most Valuable Player.

            "input": "text:Right now, the rich and famous are touring homes in virtual reality 2014and in a few years, so could everyone.  The Matthew Hood Real Estate Group at Sotheby 2019s International Realty BID has begun experimenting with Samsung Gear VR as a new showcase for multi-million dollar homes based in Los Angeles, as well as luxury residences in the Hamptons and in New York City.  Hood says the types of homes this works best for today are high-end homes, because the cost of scanning a home for VR ranges from $300-$700. The real estate agent first experimented with filming 360-degree video of homes using a stationary camera set-up with 10 GoPro cameras, but 3D scans allow a customer to walk through a house using a hand controller for navigation.  VR lets Hood show homes from across the country or across the world, and get the same view as the buyer.   201cI can lead a VR tour remotely and even see where the client is looking, which allows me to address things like a kitchen counter style while they 2019re looking at it 2014just as I would in a real world tour, 201d Hood says.  Hood is pushing to create a network across Sotheby 2019s offices, so that when he has a listing like a $7 million Venice, Calif., home he just 3D-scanned for VR, the San Francisco office can access that content for Silicon Valley companies. (Venice has been dubbed  201cSilicon Beach 201d because of all the tech companies that have opened there recently.)  Los Angeles, in particular, is a city that was built for VR real estate tours, according to Hood. It can take two days to visit 10 houses because of traffic, which is a lot of time for an executive to take off work. VR also allows buyers throughout Asia and Europe to check out homes before flying in to finalize a deal. On the seller side, VR allows celebrities and owners of expensive homes to focus on only buyers with legitimate interest in purchasing.  Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter believes one of the reasons Facebook FB purchased Oculus VR last year for $2 billion is because of VR 2019s real estate potential.   201cYou could do real estate open houses with 360-degree views and have a client come to your office and check out 50 homes through a head-mounted display and then pick the top ones to visit in person, 201d Pachter says.  201cFacebook looks at VR as skipping the realtor completely. 201d  Hood doesn 2019t believe that will happen any time soon.   201cBuying a home completely in VR may be possible, but not for another 15 to 20 years, 201d Hood says.  201cThere are complications involving homes that require expertise and continue to require third-party involvement. 201d  Hood believes VR will trickle down to lower-priced homes for everyday sales within five years. He sees the floodgates opening once the Zillow of VR is created.   201cA number of young tech companies are exploring an entirely in-VR experience where you enter search criteria like price, location, and number of rooms and you 2019re presented a number of homes and you can virtually tour, 201d Hood says.  201cOnce that happens, you 2019ll look back and say,  2018How did we do this before? 2019 201d  Sign up for Data Sheet, Fortune 2019s daily newsletter about the business of technology.

            "input": "text:It was the end of a quiet summer day in Intervale, N.H., and Francis and Maria Limmer of Peter Limmer & Sons, custom bootmakers, were about to close up  shop when a bearded young hiker rushed in. He was having trouble with his Limmer boots, he said, a bone spur in his heel pressing against the leather was excruciatingly painful. Could something be done about it? Indeed it could. Mr. Limmer calmly set to work to ease the spot out, pressing a pocket to make room for the protrusion. Was that better? No? A further adjustment and the boot fit to the hiker's satisfaction. ''Are you a skier?'' Mr. Limmer asked in parting. ''Ah, I thought so, a ski boot will do that to you. You didn't get that from our boots.''  Dealing with such a problem is all in the day's work for Mr. Limmer, who, with his brother, Peter Limmer Jr., is carrying on the business started by their late father, Peter Limmer Sr., a master craftsman who emigrated to this country from Peterskirchen, Bavaria, in 1925.  The Limmer reputation rests on one item alone, a distinctive hiking boot constructed of one piece of black leather with only one seam. ''It's an expensive way. There's more waste out of a hide,'' said Francis Limmer. Such a boot, however, is particularly durable and bends with the foot naturally. The upper is turned out at the welt area to provide a waterproof flange, another important point. Of Swiss-tanned cowhide, the boot is leather lined, has a steel shank and a Vibram sole attached by cement and screws.  Despite the proliferation of commercially made hiking boots, Peter Limmer & Sons retains a loyal following and is holding its own. Legion are the hikers and backpackers who swear by the product and wouldn't dream of wearing anything else; besides, in hiking circles the boot is something of a status symbol.  Each year about 850 to 1,000 pairs of boots are sent to all 50 states and all over the world from New Zealand to Malaysia, from the Himalayas to the Andes to the Alps, as attested by the photographs tacked up on the workshop wall. Some hikers are so attached to their Limmers they insist on being married in them. Mrs. Limmer likes to show visitors the portrait of a formally clad couple cutting their wedding cake, the bridegroom's pants raised ever so slightly to reveal sturdy hiking boots.  Each pair of Limmer boots entails 12 hours of labor from start to finish. The older son, Peter Limmer Jr., comes in Mondays and sets up the lasts, leaving his brother, Francis, and his son, Peter Stefan, to spend the remainder of the week finishing the boots.  The Limmer boots, made to the size of the customer's larger foot, are $150 a pair, not bad Francis Limmer feels, considering that boots custom made for each individual foot by Merrell of Vernal, Utah, cost $450 a pair. For an additional $15 the Limmers will supply an insulated boot that is identical in appearance but has a layer of Ensolite between the lining and the outer layer of the uppers and under the innersole. Such a boot is good for use in weather as cold as 20 degrees Fahrenheit and is intended for hikers constantly on the move, rather than for climbers who may have to stand around between pitches or legs of the climb.  The founder of the company started his business in Germany in 1919. When he settled in Jamaica Plain, Mass., he opened a shoe repair shop but soon he was making sturdy low- cut walking shoes that took the fancy of students at Harvard and other colleges in the Boston area. From there he progressed to ski boots. ''He was the first to make ski boots in the United States,'' according to his son.  The Limmer sons were pressed into service after school. ''No hanging around on street corners for us,'' said Francis Limmer. ''Except for three and a half years in the service it's all we've ever done. We were a close family with an ethnic upbringing.'' Neither Francis, who saw action with the 10th Mountain Division in Italy during World War II, nor Peter Jr., who served with the Air Corps, bothered to avail himself of a college education under the G.I. Bill, since each already had a profession. And their sons, Peter Stefan Limmer and Karl Limmer, have followed suit. After eight years in the family business, however, Karl has set up shop on his own in Bakersfield, Vt., and he's still making boots - for loggers and horseback riders as well as for hikers.  Headquarters for the Limmers since 1950 has been a rustic old carriage house. Maria Limmer has her office just inside the front door next to an area with wooden benches, where customers can be measured and can try on boots. Francis Limmer and his nephew work at tables against big windows looking out west across the fields to the Moat Mountain range. They don't mind at all if visitors watch. Between the reception area and the workshop proper are shelves filled with shiny new boots awaiting their owners, each pair bearing a label with the customer's name and date of completion.  Recently, the Limmers again began making a few of the sturdy walking shoes that initially established their father's reputation in the 1930's; today the price is $75 a pair, against $7.50 in the 1930's.  Francis Limmer is reluctant to accept orders for children's boots. When a 16-year-old came in with her parents recently, he insisted she be measured wearing three pairs of socks and warned her parents she might outgrow the boots before she wore them out.  Indeed, with proper care Limmer boots will last for years, and many pairs come back to be resoled and reconditioned.  Maria Limmer recommends that the boots be treated with mink oil paste to waterproof and lubricate the leather. When wet she says they should be stuffed with newspaper and dried away from the heat.  Peter Limmer & Sons (State Route 16A, Intervale, N.H.; 603-356-5378) is open Monday through Saturday from 8 A.M. to noon and from 1 to 5 P.M.  Be sure to bring the socks you are going to wear with you when you come to be measured. You will probably have to wait about five months for your boots because of the backlog of orders.  Boots can also be ordered by mail: write to Peter Limmer & Sons Inc., Post Office Box 88, Intervale, N.H. 03845 for self-measuring instructions.  photos of boots; Map of New England Summary: It was the end of a quiet summer day in Intervale, N.H., and Francis and Maria Limmer of Peter Limmer & Sons, custom bootmakers, were about to close up   shop when a bearded young hiker rushed in.

Dolly Parton is cool. I started listening to her in the 1990s on the radio when I was in junior high school in Webster, Texas. When I found out what she looked like 2014the tight outfits, the cleavage, the bright lipstick and the big blond hair 2014I loved her even more. She was so comfortable in her own skin and liked looking that way. She's also a terrific singer-songwriter, and many of her lyrics are about her struggles coming up hard. My favorite is  Coat of Many Colors.    Coat  [by Ms. Parton] was recorded in 1971 and is about Dolly's memories of her mother making her a winter coat by sewing together colorful rags. To keep Dolly from feeling shame, her mother told her that being poor was just a state of mind. When I first heard  Coat,  I bought a cassette tape of the album for our boom box at home.  There wasn't a whole lot of music in our house growing up. Both of my parents are from South America, and I think they wanted to let my younger sister and me thoroughly explore American culture without being influenced by their own music. So no one blinked when I started playing  Coat  around the house.  We never wanted for anything in our home, but I know we struggled. To hear Dolly sing,  Now I know we had no money   But I was rich as I could be   In my coat of many colors  My momma made for me,  it always reminds me to be grateful for everything I have, including a loving family.  Dolly's courage on  Coat  also helped me become an actress. The words took my focus off the superficial stuff and the discomfort of starting out and let me focus on what I needed to do to be good enough. Despite Dolly's background, she was able to find her self-worth, work hard and become special.  I haven't shared my interest in Dolly with too many people. Friends roll their eyes when I talk about her. My younger sister gets it 2014but she loves Loretta Lynn. My makeup staff knows, since I play Dolly's music in the trailer before I go on the set. I even made mix CDs of Dolly's music for two of the actors on the show, but I don't know if they've ever listened to them.

A tooth of an extinct giant shark called 'Carcharodon megalodon' found by paleontologists during a project to recover fossils during the Panama Canal expansion, is displayed after a news conference in Panama City, Friday, April 26, 2013. A group of scientists and paleontologists have completed a project with the Panama Canal Authority to recover fossils of at least ten new species of animals that inhabited the earth millions of years ago.  A dead great white shark is seen in Mystic, Conn., Aug. 8, 1983. The shark, 16.5 feet long and weighing 3,300 lbs., was caught by two fishermen from Connecticut after a 10-hour battle 10 miles off the coast of Block Island, R.I. It is believed to be one of the largest great whites ever to be caught in the North Atlantic Ocean.

This photo released by the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department shows the surfboard being ridden by 39-year-old surfer Francisco Javier Solorio Jr., who was fatally attacked by a shark Tuesday, Oct. 23, 2012. An expert has determined that Solorio was killed by a 15- to 16-foot great white shark, according to Ralph Collier of the Shark Research Committee. He was bitten in the upper torso in the waters off Surf Beach on Vandenberg Air Force Base in Santa Barbara County and died at the scene despite a friend's efforts to save him.  In an undated photo provided by the Oregon State Police, a 12-foot Great White Shark is displayed near Depoe Bay, Ore. A 20-foot recreational fishing boat brought the shark to Depoe Bay and it likely died Saturday after getting tangled in his crab pot lines.

The 2,602-pound shark was the second Great White caught in Montauk waters in the past nine days. Sitting on the shark is Tom Lizza, captain of the The Violator, who harpooned the shark, and Gail Gutterman, who shot it before putting on the tail rope.  A great white shark surfaces and snaps at a seal-shaped decoy. These decoys, coupled with chumming, decrease unintended feeding of sharks by attracting them to dive boats by scent, and limit the amount of bait needed.  GANSBAAI, SOUTH AFRICA - JULY 08: A Great White Shark swims in Shark Alley near Dyer Island on July 8, 2010 in Gansbaai, South Africa.  A collection of whale bone fossils discovered during excavation of the reservoir in La Jolla, Calif., in Dec.,2000, are shown in this handout photo provided by the City of San Diego. The fossils were identified by paleontologists, in July 2001, as the remains of an extinct type of baleen whale that swam in a huge bay covering what is now Mount Soledad. Paleontologists, who are required by San Diego County to monitor sensitive construction sites, spotted the fossils and halted construction. They pulledout a partial skull, both ear bones, a lower limb bone and broken ribs from the soil. Shark teeth belonging to an ancestor of the Great White Shark also were found.

(AP Photo)  Whether you're frightened of them or not, it's still unfortunate to learn that one less great white exists now.  Researchers were tagging great whites to study their movements. In the process, they tagged a nine-foot female, who left the area safely. Four months later, her tag was found on a beach near where she was first caught -- and the data tells a very interesting story.   It showed this profile going down the shelf to 580 meters, then a huge temperature change ... another living animal,  said a Smithsonian researcher.  Yes, it appears that the nine-foot great white was eaten. The big question? What ate her? Whatever it was, it had to be big enough to swallow almost 10 feet of apex predator, and quick enough to drag it almost 2,000 feet in a few seconds.  So, what is it? A giant squid? Godzilla? A Megalodon? Well, actually, that last one is not too far off from the real theory.  The Megalodon was a prehistoric shark, much like a great white ... but 60-feet long. Researchers don't actually believe it was a Megalodon, but they do think it was a giant shark: a great white about 16-feet long and weighing over 4,000 lbs. This deduction came from studying the migratory patterns of other great whites that happened to be in the same area as the missing shark with matching body temperatures.  Still, that is just a hypothesis for now. They still don't know for sure what ate this great white.  Interested in this wild story?

            "input": "text:Even before the Sharks dropped the first two games of the Stanley Cup Final in Pittsburgh, the Bay Area already had the odds stacked against the possibility of an NBA-NHL championship parlay.  The Sharks and Warriors represent the ninth time that one market has fielded teams in the NBA and NHL finals in the same season. None of the previous eight instances produced a double-championship celebration. The breakdown:  -- 3: NBA team wins, NHL team loses. -- 2: NHL team wins, NBA team loses. -- 3: Both teams lose. -- 0: Both teams win.  On those eight occasions, the NBA and NHL teams played in the same gym rink. That's not the case this time, but with the uniqueness of the Bay Area market, they represent the same general fan base.  When the Warriors won the title in 1975, their home games in the NBA Finals were played at the Cow Palace in Daly City, just south of San Francisco, because the Ice Follies were booked for the Oakland Coliseum Arena. The Sharks played their first two seasons in the Cow Palace while the arena in downtown San Jose was being built. The Warriors spent the 1996-97 season playing in San Jose while the Coliseum Arena underwent renovations. (It wasn't renamed Oracle until 2006.)  Here's what happened the other seven times when NHL and NBA teams from the same region went to the finals of their respective leagues:  With their star core of Martin Brodeur, Scott Niedermayer and Scott Stevens, the Devils outlast Anaheim in seven games of the Stanley Cup Final. It's the third Cup for the Devils since 1995, and they have a different coach each time: Jacques Lemaire, Larry Robinson and Pat Burns. Defenseman Ken Daneyko, a part of New Jersey's original draft class in 1982, retires on top.  Led by the combination of Jason Kidd, Richard Jefferson and Kenyon Martin, the Nets reach the NBA Finals for the second consecutive season. Swept by the Lakers in 2002, the Nets push the Spurs to six games in 2003. Tim Duncan nearly has a quadruple-double with 21 points, 20 rebounds, 10 assists and eight blocks in the clinching game.  The Rangers end 54 years of frustration by beating the Canucks in the Stanley Cup Final. Brian Leetch, Adam Graves and Mark Messier score goals for a 3-2 win in Game 7. Leetch becomes the first American to win the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP.  The Knicks take a 3-2 series lead against the Rockets after winning Game 5, which gets one of the lowest ratings in NBA Finals history thanks to the O.J. Simpson freeway chase. In Game 6, John Starks, who scored 16 points in the fourth quarter, has his three-point attempt blocked by Hakeem Olajuwon in the final seconds, and the Rockets win 86-84. In Game 7, Olajuwon has 25 points, 10 rebounds, seven assists and three blocks, and the Rockets prevail 90-84. Starks shoots 2-for-18, including 0-for-11 on three-pointers. Knicks coach Pat Riley never brings veteran shooting guard Rolando Blackman off the bench to sub for Starks, a decision he calls  the biggest mistake I ever made.   With Chris Chelios, Jeremy Roenick and Ed Belfour, the Blackhawks roll into the Stanley Cup Final on an 11-game winning streak. Then they get swept by the Penguins, who repeat as champions, and Mario Lemieux does likewise with the Conn Smythe.  The Bulls also repeat by handling Portland in six games in the NBA Finals. In Game 1, Michael Jordan makes six three-pointers in the first half, prompting his famous shrugging gesture toward NBC color commentator Magic Johnson to express his own disbelief. In Game 6 at Chicago, the Trail Blazers lead 79-64 entering the fourth quarter. But the Bulls dial up the defensive pressure and win 97-93 as Jordan finishes with 33 points and four steals.  The Flyers set an NHL record with a 35-game unbeaten streak (25 20130 201310) and finish 25 points ahead of the Islanders in the regular season. But when the teams meet in the Stanley Cup Final, the Islanders win it in six games. Bobby Nystrom's OT winner in Game 6 clinches it, and it is the first of four consecutive Cups for the Islanders. Televised by CBS, this is the last Stanley Cup Final game broadcast on network TV in the U.S. until 1995 when Fox shows the Devils-Red Wings series.  With Julius Erving leading the way, the 76ers make their second trip to the NBA Finals in four seasons. But Lakers rookie Magic Johnson steals the show and the title. The Lakers take a 3-2 series lead back to Philadelphia for Game 6, but Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who has been dominating with a 33.4-point average in the Finals, stays in Los Angeles with a severe ankle injury. Magic delivers with 42 points, 15 rebounds and seven assists to win the first of his five NBA titles.  This title is notable for the Celtics because it's their first after Bill Russell's retirement. John Havlicek and Dave Cowens are the stars for Boston. The Bucks counter with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Oscar Robertson. The road team wins five of the seven games in the series. Cowens posts 28 points and 14 rebounds in Game 7, a 102-87 win in Milwaukee.  With Bobby Orr and Phil Esposito, the Bruins won the Stanley Cup in 1970 and 1972. In 1974, the Bruins post the best regular-season record with 113 points. But the Flyers, who won the Western Division with 112 points, take the Cup in six games. Philadelphia goalie Bernie Parent posts a 1-0 shutout in Game 6 and earns the Conn Smythe.  The Knicks win Game 1 of the Finals against Los Angeles, but they are overmatched. The Lakers set the NBA record with 69 regular-season wins and a 33-game winning streak. They finish the Knicks, who don't have Willis Reed because of a knee injury, in five games, and Jerry West finally wins a title.  Led by 50-goal scorer Vic Hadfield, the Rangers reach the Stanley Cup Final for the first time since 1950. But they run into the Bruins with Orr, who wins his third consecutive Hart Trophy as league MVP this season. Orr scores four goals in the Final series to earn his second Conn Smythe in three years.  The Celtics beat the St. Louis Hawks to win the NBA title in 1957, Bill Russell's rookie season. Russell has 32 rebounds in Game 7, a 125-123 double-overtime win. They lose the rematch in 1958. Hall of Famer Bob Petit scores 50 points, including the Hawks' final basket, in a 110-109 win to clinch the title in Game 6.  The Bruins, captained by Hall of Fame defenseman Fern Flaman, lose both years to the Montreal Canadiens, who are in the process of winning an unprecedented five consecutive Stanley Cups.

There was no immediate comment from Adams & Smith, a nationwide construction contractor.  Brown said Adams & Smith hired him as an iron worker in late August but assigned him and another African American to mostly menial tasks, such as sweeping and picking up garbage, even though Brown is a certified welder.  On Sept. 25, the suit said, Brown was doing rigging work near the toll plaza when his foreman, a white man, dropped a noose next to him. About 20 minutes later, he said, a white co-worker tossed him a rope and told him to put it around his neck. Later that day, he said, the foreman placed a rope on the car of the other African American worker at the site.  Brown said he complained to his shop steward about both incidents, and spoke several days later to a company steward, who told him he was aware of what had happened and would take care of it. But Adams & Smith took no action against Brown 2019s foreman or the white co-worker, and instead reduced Brown 2019s daily work hours, the suit said.  On Wednesday, Oct. 7, the company sent Brown home after a half day and told him it had no more work for him that week, the suit said. It said Brown learned that his white co-workers remained at their jobs for the week.  Brown, who needed full-time work, lined up another job through his union and now works for Pacific Gas and Electric Co. in Stockton, his lawyer said.

Minecraft proved so popular, that after attracting over 100 million registered users, Microsoft MSFT purchased Mojang for $2.5 billion in September 2014.  Now gamers have a choice between building Minecraft worlds or using virtual Lego bricks.  Loz Doyle, executive producer of Lego Worlds at TT Games, knows that kids spend a lot of time playing Minecraft these days in the virtual world as well as with Lego play sets in the real world. He says the appeal is that they 2019re free to do whatever they want 2014build anything they can think of, put their creative hat on, experiment and have fun with their friends.   201cUltimately, our goal is to create a powerful digital building system based on creativity, discovery and exploration that is just as much fun as the physical Lego building experience, just offered in a new way, 201d Doyle says.  201cMinecraft 2019s building system is very simple, all blocks are the exact same size and shape, so it 2019s straightforward to build with. And unlike with Lego, there is no physical counterpart to compare the experience with. With the Lego Worlds in-game digital builder, we currently have more than 100 different bricks to choose from, along with a huge range of colors. 201d  Features will be added and changes will be made to Lego Worlds as the early PC players provide feedback on the game, according to David Haddad, executive vice president and general manager of Warner Bros.

But rather than offering realistic solutions, candidates in both parties are blaming our problems on easy targets who breed resentment. For Republicans, it 2019s Mexicans here illegally and Muslims. And for Democrats, it 2019s the wealthy and Wall Street. The truth is: We cannot solve the problems we face by blaming anyone. 201d  Trump, the Republican front-runner, has repeatedly promised to build a border wall and get Mexico to pay for it and has called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States. Sanders, a Democratic candidate, has repeatedly targeted Wall Street and the  201cbillionaire class. 201d Both he and Hillary Clinton have said they will reform big financial institutions if elected.

It 2019s traditional, he noted, to have three debates  2013  201cso let 2019s have the third one in an innovative way and that every Australian can participate in, that allows the interactivity that the old formats ... don 2019t allow for that interactivity. 201d  #Auspol Turnbull proposes online debate.

Exclusive footage of Turnbull at the Facebook #leadersdebate pic.twitter.com 5U9kS3NCRT  Both Turnbull 2019s and Shorten 2019s campaign plans were put on hold today to accommodate visits to flood-affected New South Wales. Shorten began his day in Adelaide with a seven-kilometre run with premier Jay Weatherill.  @TomMcIlroy yes he did & at a good clip  Shorten then sung from his competitor 2019s songsheet about jobs and growth (the tune was a bit different: today 2019s policy was on apprenticeships) before winging his way back to the east coast to inspect the devastation caused by the weekend 2019s storms.  He said he contacted Turnbull  2013 who also suspended campaigning today  2013 to offer to visit affected regions together in a show of bipartisanship:  201cThe issue is not Mr Turnbull or I, it is the people experiencing loss, and damage. 201d  Related: Guardian Live election special event with Lenore Taylor and Katharine Murphy  The joint billing didn 2019t happen, but Turnbull later echoed Shorten 2019s sentiment ( 201cwe are absolutely united 201d) at his stand-up in Picton alongside Mike Baird, the NSW premier.  Shortly after holding a baby, Turnbull said the  201cpowerful 201d storm was no match for the powerful community spirit.  201cWe 2019re here to support them, admire them and thank them, 201d he said of Picton 2019s residents.

Morrison doesn 2019t.   201cMr Shorten is just playing rank politics on this issue, 201d seethed Morrison.  201cIt is not a game, Bill. 201d  The former prime minister John Howard was also in Adelaide today, campaigning for Jamie Briggs in Mayo, who had Turnbull at his elbow just last week. Hmm  2013 perhaps Turnbull 2019s assertion he wasn 2019t worried by the threat posed by the Nick Xenophon Team in the electorate was not strictly true.  Howard likened Xenophon to Pauline Hanson on free trade in an interview on 5AA this morning, for which the independent later thanked him:  201cI 2019m very grateful that he 2019s given the Nick Xenophon Team so much oxygen in South Australia with his attack.

Meloni told James Lipton on Thursday's episode of  Inside the Actors Studio  that while fans often pulled for a relationship to happen between their characters, the show's cast and crew  always knew it would have been the death knell of that relationship.   THE HOLLYWOOD REPORTER: 'LAW & ORDER: SVU' BOSS REVEALS SCRAPPED PLANS FOR POSSIBLE CHRISTOPHER MELONI RETURN  We  needed to keep that line taut but very clear,  Meloni said.  Keep the tension  2014 never cross it.   He added that he admired his co-star Hargitay, who was the first to point out to him that they were the parents of the show.  I'm the guy who will right the wrong and she's the one who will nurture,  he said, adding that a romance would have ruined that dynamic.  The actor has also starred in Oz, True Blood, Wet Hot American Summer and now appears on WGN America's Underground. In Thursday's episode, Meloni shared with Lipton how hard it was to play both Stabler and Oz inmate, murderer Chris Keller, simultaneously.  THE HOLLYWOOD REPORTER: 'CHICAGO LAW': BIGGEST BURNING QUESTIONS ABOUT NBC'S 'CHICAGO LAW' AND LATEST POTENTIAL SPINOFF   I knew I was the luckiest actor in New York City,  Meloni said.  To be a working actor in New York City is good enough, to have a steady gig in New York City is a dream come true. To have two, which are awesome shows  2014 forget about it.    It wasn't easy,  said Meloni.  For about two or three years, I would wake up at 4:30 a.m., get in the van at 6 a.m., drive to Oz, kill people and sodomize them until about noon, jump in the car, go to SVU and go arrest people who murder and sodomize people until about 2 a.m.   When Lipton asked what motivated Keller to kill in the show, Meloni joked,  I think he was framed.   Lipton also went back into Meloni's background, talking about how he knew he wanted to be an actor. In 1984, Meloni told Lipton, he  didn 2019t know what I was going to do, so I called up a high school friend. He said he 2019s going to New York to study acting. And that was it, I went, 'Oh my god, so am I!   THE HOLLYWOOD REPORTER: 'LAW & ORDER: SVU' BOSS ON TEAM'S 'CHALLENGING YEAR' AHEAD  Throughout the hour-long interview, Meloni opened up to Lipton about his insecurities, his biggest regret (he never played college football), flying planes with John Travolta and his proudest moment:  peeing in a bucket  on Oz.

            "input": "text:The recent dustup between Amazon and publisher Hachette reminds us that retail is a brutal business  2014 tough on employees, really hard on suppliers. Walmart, the largest physical retailer, and Amazon, the largest retailer online, illustrate the pain produced in the effort to make consumers 2019 prices as low as possible.  Consider the plight of those working in retail. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, retail salespeople and cashiers were the two largest occupations in the U.S. in 2013, together employing almost 8 million people. These are low-paid occupations under the best of circumstances. While the median hourly wage for all employed people was $16.87, cashiers made just 58% of the median, and sales clerks just 60%.  Numerous news articles document the tough working conditions for both Amazon and Walmart employees. Both employers face suits for not paying employees for all their required time at work, including time waiting to go through a security check at Amazon 2019s warehouses to guard against shoplifting. Amazon 2019s German employees have been striking over wages since last year. A homeless shelter in Jeffersonville, Ind., has had between two and six Amazon distribution-center employees living there at all times. Many articles describe the harsh work culture at Amazon, some calling it a  201csoul-crushing experience. 201d  Walmart is scarcely better. Fifteen percent of Walmart 2019s Ohio employees are on food stamps. Employees receive $2.66 billion in government assistance annually. A study by the University of California, Berkeley 2019s Center for Labor Research and Education noted that, even after statistically controlling for differences in geography,  201cWal-Mart workers earn an estimated  2026 14.5 percent less than workers in large retail 201d and that  201cseveral recent studies have found that the entry of Wal-Mart into a county reduces both average and aggregate earnings of retail workers and reduces the share of retail workers with health coverage on the job. 201d  But it 2019s Amazon 2019s relationship with its suppliers that makes the company worse than Walmart. There 2019s no doubt that Walmart pressures suppliers for the lowest possible price. But once the products are in the stores, both Walmart and the chosen suppliers 2019 interests are well aligned  2014 to sell as much as possible of the stocked items. It costs money to build stores and ship products to them. More important, choices are necessarily limited in a physical store. So Walmart wants to move as much of the merchandise it decides to sell as possible. Having chosen a supplier and negotiated a deal, there is at least some degree of temporary commitment by Walmart to the vendor.  By contrast, Amazon  2014 with no stores and an IT infrastructure that makes the cost of adding items to sell close to zero  2014 doesn 2019t care what you buy, or even which of their online partners you use, as long as you buy the product through Amazon. Take books, the focus of the recent conflict. Walmart stocks a relatively small selection, so it wants to move the specific books it offers. Walmart 2019s interests line up quite nicely with the authors and publishers it promotes. Amazon stocks everything (except apparently now books published by Hachette), so it doesn 2019t care which particular book you buy. Simply put, Amazon has less incentive to make any specific supplier successful. To Walmart, for books or anything else, selling a million units of one item is great; selling one unit of a million items is impossible in its physical stores. For Amazon, who cares? That 2019s why relationships with suppliers, always contentious, will be particularly problematic at Amazon, especially when Amazon controls so much of the retail market share.  Some believe that low-paid, overworked, unhappy employees are the new model in an Internet age of offshoring, outsourcing and computer-monitored work. It 2019s quite possible that online retailing is also creating a new model of retailer-supplier relationships, with much less sense of partnership and shared fate than in the past. If so, Amazon 2019s fight with Hachette presages trouble for lots of suppliers, not just book publishers, in the very near future  2014 at least if Amazon 2019s market dominance persists. Summary: With no stores and an IT infrastructure that makes the cost of adding inventory close to zero, Amazon doesn't have to care about its suppliers",

            "input": "text:A stalemate between Britain and the European Union over what happens next following Britons 2019 referendum vote to leave has opened up a host of possible scenarios.  Here are some that are (in some cases, barely) conceivable:  Prime Minister David Cameron, who said he will resign after losing his gamble to end British ambivalence about staying in, agrees with the EU establishment that the only legal way to leave is to use Article 50 of the EU 2019s Lisbon Treaty to negotiate a withdrawal.  He wants to leave triggering the process to his successor, who may not be chosen by the Conservative party until October. EU leaders want him to do it now, or at least as soon as possible, but they lack the legal power to force him.  In the most amicable divorce scenario, Britain would trigger Article 50, possibly (though unlikely now) as early as Tuesday when Cameron meets the other 27 EU leaders at a Brussels summit, or via a formal letter later from Cameron or his successor.  That sets a two-year time limit on negotiating an amicable withdrawal. Ideally, it would divide up assets and liabilities in the shared EU budget and other priority business, such as perhaps the status of British and other EU citizens who find themselves living on the wrong side of a hard new UK-EU border.  In an even more ideal world, it would set out a new, close economic relationship between Britain and the EU, possibly in a separate, parallel treaty taking effect from the exit date. The withdrawal treaty can be enacted by just 20 of the 27 other states representing 65% of the remaining population. A full new relationship would probably need unanimous support.  Two years is very tight but the negotiations can be extended if all 28 countries agree. If there is no deal, then Britain is simply out of the EU two years after Article 50 was triggered 2014an outcome written in to the treaty to limit uncertainties.  Really? Too good to be true. The EU is never this easy.  2. Sorry, We Didn 2019t Mean It  Britain is in political meltdown, with both main parties in civil war and pro-EU Scotland threatening to either block Brexit legally (unclear how) or break away. The referendum result is not constitutionally binding and government and parliament, maybe after a new election, could just ignore it. If so, the EU would carry on as before but a special membership deal it gave Cameron in February has been killed by the referendum result.  Really? Pushed democratic credibility beyond breaking point.  3. We Mean It, But Not Yet  Brexit campaigners have long been suspicious of the two-year limit in Article 50 and some have explicitly said it should only formally be triggered AFTER they have agreed a comprehensive free trade deal that relieves Britain of EU rules such as open EU immigration. Five years or more is the norm globally for such big trade deals. Britain would be a full EU member until then.  That is a nightmare scenario for EU leaders, plunging the bloc into open-ended negotiations with its second biggest power that would inspire eurosceptics across the bloc to emulate it and distract governments from other pressing European issues.  They rule out opening any negotiation until Britain binds itself to the timetable set out in Article 50. And they insist Britain cannot have its cake on market access and still eat it by ending EU budget payments and free movement of workers.  In theory, there could be an endless standoff, with Britain the sulky teenager at the table, poisoning the atmosphere next year as France and Germany run elections and the EU starts confrontational talks on a new 7-year budget. Something would have to give and some compromise would start to be worked out.  Really? Compromise is the EU Way; Don 2019t Rule This Out.  4. We Mean It 2014Or Maybe We Didn 2019t  Article 50 suggests a one-way exit, rather than a revolving door. EU officials insist that once triggered, a state cannot back out and stay. Lawyers are divided, however. Some British experts believe the leave notice could simply be withdrawn. In Brussels, others say that could happen but only if agreed by all. A future British government might conclude that the best way to end divorce proceedings is just to agree to stay married.  Really? See Scenario 2, but with added fanning of memories.  5. Can We Just Tweak This Quickly?  Some Brexit campaigners have suggested that the Leave vote simply serve as leverage to renegotiate better, semi-detached terms for Britain inside the EU which could be put to another referendum. EU leaders have ruled that out on the same grounds as above that  201ccherry picking 201d will spread and wreck the Union. Cameron 2019s deal, to protect the City of London from the euro zone and curb EU immigration, has been killed by a clause that linked it to last week 2019s referendum result. So any talks would start from a lower base and EU leaders would have to eat their words. But some kind of  201cassociate membership 201d or  201cspecial partnership 201d has been around as an idea in Europe for a time.  Really? See 4, but never say never in Euro-compromise land.  6. Let 2019s Just Slip Into Something More Comfortable  Britain could try to join the European Economic Area or European Free Trade Association, joining the likes of Norway, Switzerland or Iceland in close partnerships with the EU. That could fly with the EU but British leaders would have to persuade Brexit voters to agree to the EU budget contributions and migrants that are accepted by some of those countries. It also would lack the kind of EU market access for services trade which is so important to Britain 2019s big financial sector. A more tailor-made deal would bring things back to earlier scenarios.  Really? Doesn 2019t seem to be what Britons want, at least now.  7. Why Don 2019t We Start Again?  One extreme view is that the fallout from Brexit in the EU might be so cataclysmic that Europeans would go back to the drawing board and effectively create a new kind of Union that could include Britain. Marshaling disparate national ambitions into a new structure would be a colossal task, not least in the wake of the bitterness that the current crisis has engendered.  Really? A definite long shot, not one for the near future.  Some people who voted to Leave have said that if it doesn 2019t work outside, Britain could always join the EU again. That is true, though it would get no favors. It would face a years-long accession process and require unanimous acceptance by existing members and have to accept a host of conditions that Britain has opted out of during its past 43 years 2014notably adopting the euro and a virtually 50% rebate on EU membership fees.  Really? One for the (very long-lived) birds.  9. Room for a Little One?  Some Scots hope to avoid Brexit by breaking from England. An idea that an independent Scotland could somehow simply sit in the vacant UK chair in Brussels is dismissed by EU officials.  At the time of the 2014 independence referendum, the EU said Scotland could apply for membership but would go to the  201cback of the queue, 201d behind the likes of Serbia, and that its hope of keeping the pound rather than the euro was a non-starter. There is some sympathy for Scots losing their place in the EU but also deep suspicion of secession, especially in Spain, Belgium and Italy, which have their own separatist problems. And a veto.  Really? Not soon, but Scotland could join the EU one day.  A new British government simply walks out. It could launch Article 50 and leave legally in 2019 without any negotiation. It could also ignore the two-year notice period and tear up its treaty obligations and quit right away, though that would undermine its credibility as a party to international law. There is, however, nothing the EU can do to prevent that.  It could retaliate on trade or against Britons living in the EU, however much that would create a painful tit-for-tat that would badly hurt Europe 2019s economy and citizens. Nonetheless, EU leaders fear that letting Brexit Britain walk all over them will only inspire other European nationalists to destroy the Union.  Really? Threat of mutually assured destruction then detente? Summary: None of them are easy.",

As the magazine wrote:  For eight of 11 international travelers presently arriving in New York, the warming symbol of journey 2019s end no longer is the stately, green copper Statue of Liberty seen from a boat deck, but a glistening complex of low-lying architecture 2014strongly suggestive of a world 2019s fair site 2014seen from the window of an airplane.  The airport had been open since 1948, but it experienced a major growth spurt between 1957 and 1962, when United, American, Pan American, Northwest and TWA all opened new terminals. LIFE praised its innovative meeting of form and function and its well-oiled logistical operation:  Idlewild is more than the handsomest, highest-geared air terminal in operation; it is several terminals, each attuned to the newest advances in the technology of getting people and freight on and off airplanes as fast as possible. Its every feature bespeaks speed and function. Yet, for the disembarking passenger Idlewild offers vivid and lasting impressions of one of America 2019s most imposing displays of artistic and industrial design.

            "input": "text:THERE was a time each year, soon after Alexis Lichine had returned to New York from the harvest at Prieure-Lichine, his chateau in Bordeaux, when we would drive up to Westchester to have lunch with Alfred A. Knopf.  In the course of publishing Mr. Lichine's books, Mr. Knopf had come to know and love wine. And so at one lunch in the early 1980's he announced that we would be drinking the four Bordeaux first growths from 1945: Latour, Margaux, Lafite-Rothschild and Haut-Brion. He had opened them earlier, he said, to let them breathe. Alexis and I exchanged concerned looks and, when we sat down to eat, our fears were fulfilled. All four wines were dead. Letting them breathe had not improved them; it had killed them.  How often have you heard a waiter or a wine steward say at the beginning of a meal: ''I'll just open this now and let it breathe''? Breathing is one of the least understood components of wine service and wine drinking, in restaurants or at home. Once, at Harry's Bar in Venice, I ordered a nondescript Italian white wine as an aperitif. A few minutes later, I was astonished to see the waiter decanting the bottle.  ''To let it breathe,'' he explained.  Breathe? That wine needed to breathe about as much as the mineral water.  Alfred Knopf's wines were too old, the Harry's Bar wine too young. So when exactly does a wine need to breathe? The answer is: almost never. Certainly white wines don't. Occasionally, when a powerful red wine is opened before its time, aerating it may soften its rough, tannic edges. But this can be just as easily accomplished by pouring the wine into glasses and then letting it stand for a while before drinking it.  Simply uncorking the bottle early is practically useless. It will expose an amount of wine in the neck of the bottle equal to the size of the bottom of the cork. In other words, almost no wine at all. Mostly it gives the waiter or wine steward a bit of stage business to help inflate the pourboire. A really harsh young wine can be smoothed out a bit by decanting, but again, letting it sit in the glass for a while will accomplish much the same thing.  In 1863, when the French railroads began carrying wine from the Mediterranean to northern cities, Emperor Napoleon III called on Louis Pasteur to determine why so much wine was going bad in transit. Pasteur found that air, or more precisely, the oxygen in air, was the villain. Too much air, he discovered, allowed the growth of vinegar bacteria. On the other hand, he learned, small controlled amounts of air matured wine.  Wine matures in the bottle because of the oxygen that is found in the wine itself and in the small space between the wine and the cork. The process, oxidation, is the chemical reaction of oxygen with another chemical. And so steel rusts, copper turns green and a sliced apple becomes brown.  Oxidization in wine begins when the grapes are first picked, which is why they are rushed to the wineries, where oxygen contact can be eliminated or controlled.  The other legitimate reason for decanting wine is to avoid sediment. As they age, wines produce a deposit. It is harmless stuff, but many wine drinkers, and particularly American wine drinkers, prefer their wine squeaky clean. Filtration, a common practice in the wine industry, has mostly obviated any need for decanting; it strips out most particles before the wine is bottled. Critics say it can strip away the elements that give a wine its character and flavor.  But there is one wine that should always be decanted: vintage port. Vintage port spends long years, sometimes more than half a century, in the bottle, is never filtered and can have a considerable amount of sediment. It is often decanted over a candle. The candle light shows when sediment begins to flow through the neck of the bottle, and when the decanting process should stop.  In her Oxford Companion to Wine (1994), Jancis Robinson comes down against ever decanting wine to aerate it. She cites the great French enologist Emile Peynaud, who held that exposing wine to too much air begins a process of destroying its aroma. With very old wines, like Mr. Knopf's 1945 Bordeaux, prolonged exposure to air can be fatal, even when the surface area exposed is small. Chances are those wines would have died soon after pouring even without the previous exposure.  The difference between death and glory can be minutes. I recall a half bottle of Chateau Filhot 1911, at the Tour d'Argent in Paris. It was offered on the wine list for 100 francs or $20, hardly exorbitant for what was a 75-year-old Sauternes. The first glass was glorious. It had the intensity and richness of a wine a fifth its age; its color more burnished brass than gold, its bouquet redolent of flowers, its taste recalling the honeyed influence of botrytis.  Fifteen minutes later the wine was dead, its color muddy brown, its taste that of bitter, dried leaves. Locked safely in the restaurant's damp cool cellar, a few yards from the Seine, it might have lasted another 20 years. With its cork pulled, its life was quickly over.  I was lucky; I had a glass of a once great wine -- before breathing claimed another fragile victim. Good thing it was a half bottle. It would have been tragic to watch helplessly while a full bottle died that way.  Photo: IT'S JUST FOR SHOW -- Uncorking a bottle early does not accomplish much. (Jeffery A.

            "input": "text:Last Updated Jul 8, 2016 5:08 PM EDT  VALDOSTA, Ga. -- A man who called 911 to report a car break-in Friday ambushed a south Georgia police officer dispatched to the scene, sparking a shootout in which both the officer and suspect were wounded, authorities said. Both are expected to survive.  The shooting in Valdosta, just north of the Georgia-Florida state line, happened hours after five police officers were killed Thursday night during an ambush in Dallas. Despite saying the officer was lured to the scene by the gunman, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said there was no immediate evidence the shootings were related.   We're putting pieces together to understand what happened and why, developing witnesses,  said Scott Dutton, spokesman for the GBI, which is handling the case at the request of local police.  There's nothing to indicate there's a connection to that.   Officer Randall Hancock was shot multiple times as he responded to a 911 call about a car break-in outside the Three Oaks Apartments just after 8 a.m. Friday, Valdosta Police Chief Brian Childress said at a news conference.   The officer called out on the radio screaming for assistance,  Childress said, and officers from multiple law enforcement agencies swarmed the apartment complex.  The GBI later identified the suspected gunman as 22-year-old Stephen Paul Beck and said it was Beck who also placed the 911 call. Both Childress and Dutton identified the suspect as an Asian male. Charges against Beck were still pending Friday as he was being treated at a Florida hospital, Dutton said.  The officer is white, according to Valdosta city spokeswoman Sementha Mathews.  Dutton said one gunshot hit the officer in the abdomen, just below his protective vest. Other shots hit Hancock's vest. The officer fired back and wounded the suspect.  Hancock underwent surgery at a local hospital and was stable Friday as he rested with his family by his side, Childress said. The suspect was also considered stable, he said.   I'm relieved that my officer is fine,  Childress said.  I am also equally relieved that the offender is going to make it.   The incident comes amid an increase in ambushes and shootings on police officers.   It is often said that a law enforcement officer leaves for work each day not knowing if he or she will return home safely to his or her family,  Valdosta City Manager Larry Hanson said Friday.  Incidents like this bring realization to the danger police professionals face each and every day while carrying out their duties to serve and protect.   The police chief said Hancock was wearing a body camera, and its video footage had been turned over to the GBI.  Childress declined to comment on any possible motive when asked about his officer being shot so soon after the Dallas attacks. The Dallas officers were shot during a protest over the recent killings of black men by police in Minnesota and Louisiana.   You start to wonder,  the police chief said.  But any motive of why this happened this morning, it would be speculation.  Summary: The officer and suspect were both wounded in an exchange of gunfire after the incident in Valdosta, Ga.",

And there could be life-and-death consequences of irresponsible drone use. Earlier this summer, firefighters in southern California said their response to a wild fire was delayed because of drones flying in the area.

            "input": "text:''I would urge the U.S. government to conduct those studies,'' Dr. Podgorski said. ''Shocking a couple of pigs and dogs doesn't prove anything.''  Many police officers defend the Taser, saying the weapon helps them avoid using deadly force and lowers the risk of injury to officers. Tasers let police officers subdue suspects without wrestling with or hitting them, said David Klinger, a former police officer and a criminology professor at the University of Missouri at St. Louis. And Tasers are surely safer than firearms.  ''I think it is appropriate for deployment in the field,'' Mr. Klinger said. ''You trust this guy or gal with a gun, you should be able to trust them with a less lethal device.''  But human rights groups say the police may be overusing the Taser. Because the gun leaves only light marks, and because Taser markets it as nonlethal, officers often use it on unruly suspects, not just as an alternative to deadly force, said Dr. William F. Schulz, the executive director of Amnesty International USA. In recent incidents, officers have shocked a 9-year-old girl in Arizona and a 66-year-old woman in Kansas City.  ''We think there should be controlled, systematic independent medical studies,'' Dr. Schulz said. ''We would like to see these weapons suspended until these questions are answered.''  A study by the Orange County, Fla., sheriff's office showed that officers used pepper spray and batons much less after getting the guns. But the use of Tasers more than made up for that drop, and the department's overall use of force increased 58 percent from 2000 to 2003. Last week, several police departments in Orange County agreed to restrict the use of Tasers to situations where suspects are actively resisting officers. The sheriff's office is not part of the agreement and says it is still studying the matter.  State and federal agencies do not keep tabs on Taser use, so no one knows how many times officers have fired the weapon. Officers have reported close to 5,000 uses of the M26 to Taser, but the company says the actual number is much higher.  Little evidence supports the theory that Tasers reduce police shootings or work better than other alternatives to guns, like pepper spray. Because of their limited range, Tasers are best in situations where an officer using a Taser is covered by another with a firearm, officers say.  A 2002 company study found that nearly 85 percent of people shocked with Tasers were unarmed. Fewer than 5 percent were carrying guns.  In Phoenix, which has equipped all its officers with Tasers, police shootings fell by half last year. Taser trumpets that statistic on its Web site. But last year's drop appears to be an anomaly. This year, shootings are running at a record pace, according to the Phoenix police department.  A 2002 study in Greene County, Mo., found that Tasers were only marginally more effective than pepper spray at restraining suspects. Pepper spray worked in 91 percent of cases, while the Taser had a 94 percent success rate.  The largest police departments have been slow to embrace the Taser. The New York Police Department owns only a handful of Tasers, which are used by specialized units and supervisors, a spokesman said.  The M26 was introduced only five years ago, but the technology is much older. John Cover, an Arizona inventor, created the Taser in 1969. Its name stands for ''Thomas A. Swift Electric Rifle,'' an allusion to the Tom Swift series of science fiction novels.  Engineers have known for generations that relatively small electric currents cause painful and uncontrollable muscle contractions. Tasers operate on that principle, firing barbs that are connected by wire to the gun and flood the body with current. The gun can deliver its shock even if the barbs do not break the skin because its current can jump through two inches of clothing.  Weak currents are not inherently dangerous if they stop in a few minutes. But stronger shocks can disrupt the electrical circuitry of the heart. That condition, ventricular fibrillation, causes cardiac arrest in seconds and death in minutes, unless the heart is defibrillated with an even larger shock.  The exact current needed to cause fibrillation depends on technical factors like the current's shape and frequency, as well as the heart's condition, said James Eason, a biomedical engineering professor at Washington and Lee University. But because fibrillation is so dangerous, scientists can conduct only limited human trials. They must estimate the threshold of fibrillation from animal trials and computer models.  Still, the broad parameters for fibrillation are known, and the first Taser from Mr. Cover had a large safety margin. In 1975 the Consumer Product Safety Commission concluded that weapon, which was 11 percent as powerful as the M26, probably would not harm healthy humans.  Then, in March 1976, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms claimed it had jurisdiction over the weapons because gunpowder propelled their barbs. The firearms bureau essentially outlawed them for civilian use; no federal safety standard was ever created.  But the original Tasers were bulky and often ineffective. For almost two decades, they remained a niche product used by a few police departments.  That began to change after 1993, when Mr. Smith and his brother Thomas created a company to market electric weapons to civilians. Patrick Smith, who had just graduated from the University of Chicago business school, saw enormous potential for an alternative to firearms.  ''I just figured I'm going to go to out to Arizona, and I'm going to scratch and sniff and dig, and figure there's going to be gold in those hills,'' Mr. Smith said in an interview.  In January 1995, the Smiths introduced their first electric gun, which was powered by compressed nitrogen. As a result, the weapon was not regulated by the firearms bureau and could be sold to civilians.  For the next several years, the company struggled, as concerns over the gun's power kept sales slow. By 1999, the company, now known as Taser International, was near bankruptcy, with only $50,000 in the bank and $2.7 million in debt.  ''It was pretty humiliating,'' he said. ''We had completely wiped out my parents financially.''  Hoping to stay afloat, the company introduced the Advanced Taser M26 in December 1999. The weapon closely resembled a handgun, a feature many police officers liked, and was very powerful.  According to Taser, the gun produced 26 watts of power, four times the power of the earlier model. A field test in 2001 by the Canadian police showed that the M26 was even stronger, with an output of 39 watts.  (Stun gun power is usually gauged in watts, a measure of electrical energy, even though the biological effects of electricity are more closely related to current strength, measured in amperes. Electrical engineers often compare the flow of electricity to a river: amperes are like the river's speed, while watts are the amount of water flowing by each second. As watts increase, amperes rise, but more slowly.)  Taser's sales rose as officers learned about the new gun. At meetings with police officers, company representatives encouraged them to receive a half-second shock to feel the weapon's power for themselves. ''These guys would leave just absolutely evangelical about the product because we would just drop them all,'' Mr. Smith said.  In its marketing, the company touted the safety of the M26, saying it had been extensively tested.  But Taser had performed only two animal studies before introducing the M26.  In 1996, Taser hired Robert Stratbucker, a Nebraska doctor and farmer, to test the weapon. Dr. Stratbucker, who is now Taser's part-time medical director, shocked a pig 48 times with shocks as large as those from the M26. The pig suffered no heart damage.  Three years later, the company hired Dr. Stratbucker and Dr. Wayne McDaniel, an electrical engineer, for an animal test at the University of Missouri. The scientists shocked five anesthetized dogs about 200 times with the M26. The dogs did not suffer cardiac arrest, although one animal had changes in its heartbeat, according to a report.  Taser has repeatedly said the studies proved that the M26 was safe. But the biomedical engineers who reviewed the gun's safety for The Times said Taser should have conducted far more research.  ''I don't think there has been a definitive study saying that yes it can contribute to death or no it cannot,'' said Dr. Raymond Ideker, an electrophysiologist and a professor in the cardiology division at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Taser must test more animals and vary the shocks they receive to find the gun's safety margin, Dr. Ideker said.  In addition, while Taser claims that its Missouri study proves that the gun is safe for people who have used cocaine, it never tested animals dosed with cocaine. Because cocaine substantially increases heart attack risk, and Tasers are used on people who have taken cocaine, that omission is a serious flaw, said Dr. Wikswo of Vanderbilt.  The company should also examine risks other than fibrillation, some scientists say.  Dr. Terrence Allen, a former medical examiner in Los Angeles who examined cases in the late 1980's when people died after being shocked with earlier-model Tasers, said he was sure the weapons could be lethal. Taser is misrepresenting the medical evidence, said Dr. Allen, who has consulted for people who have sued the company.  Dr. Mark W. Kroll, a Taser director and the chief technology officer of St. Jude Medical, one of the largest pacemaker manufacturers, said Taser had adequately tested its weapons and they were safe. External pacemakers deliver much larger charges and do not cause fibrillation, he said.  Dr. Ideker countered that pacemakers and Tasers could not be easily compared, because the Taser's shock is very short and powerful, while a pacemaker delivers its charge over a much longer period.  Although Taser has performed only rudimentary studies of the M26, it has more closely studied the X26, the gun it introduced last year. In a 2003 study at the University of Missouri, Taser found that a shock roughly 20 times that of the X26 caused a healthy, anesthetized 85-pound pig to fibrillate.  Mr. Smith cites the 2003 Missouri study as proof that all Tasers have a safety margin of 20-to-1 or more. But the new gun puts out a charge only one-fourth as large as the older model, a fact Taser does not generally advertise.  The study said nothing about the M26, or about hearts stressed by disease, drugs or physical activity. ''I think another test is warranted,'' Dr. Ideker said.  Taser did not test the older gun, which is associated with nearly all the deaths, because ''we believed that the M26's safety record and prior testing speaks for itself,'' Mr. Smith said. ''Could it be done? Absolutely. There's time and expense involved.''  The X26 has become Taser's biggest seller, based mainly on the company's claims that it is even stronger than the M26 despite its small size and lower power. The company says the new gun enables electrical current to enter the body more efficiently.  No independent agency has tested the guns side by side, and in Taser's patent on the M26, Mr. Smith himself argued that weaker guns were often ineffective because they do not deliver enough current to incapacitate suspects. But neither deaths nor concerns about effectiveness have dampened police support and investor enthusiasm for Taser International. Stock analysts predict Taser will have $15 million in profits on sales of $60 million in 2004. Investors have bid up the company's shares 60-fold since last February, giving Taser a value of $1.2 billion.  The Smith brothers and their father, Phillips, have sold $46 million in Taser shares since November, according to federal filings. They still own $130 million worth of shares. Other Taser executives and directors have sold $14 million in stock. Mr. Kerik, the former New York police commissioner and a director, has sold $900,000 in stock. Mr. Kroll of St. Jude Medical has sold $1.7 million.  ''It's been great,'' Patrick Smith said of the company's recent success. But making money is not his main goal, he said. ''If we could get a Taser on every officer's belt,'' he said, '' it would save hundreds of lives or thousands of lives a year.''  Meanwhile, the number of Taser-associated deaths is rising. In June alone, at least six people died, the most ever in one month: Eric B. Christmas, James A. Cobb, Jacob J. Lair, Anthony C. Oliver, Jerry W. Pickens and Mr. Lieberman.  The circumstances of the deaths vary widely. Among the six, Mr. Pickens was the only one hit with the X26.  Mr. Cobb fought for several minutes after being shocked, which suggests that fibrillation could not have caused his death. Some of the other men collapsed immediately, according to news reports and witnesses. Some of the men were fighting with the police when officers shot them. Others simply refused to obey orders.  Mr. Pickens was one. On June 4, in Bridge City, La., the police were summoned to help calm him after an argument with his 18-year-old son, Taylor Pickens. Jerry Pickens confronted the police in the family's front yard.  ''My dad, he had been drinking, and he was kind of hostile toward the police,'' Taylor said. ''He kept trying to go back inside the house, and they said, 'If you're going to go back into the house we're going to Taser you.''' Mr. Pickens who was unarmed, began to walk inside, Taylor said.  ''They counted down three, and then they shot him in the back,'' Taylor said. ''My dad stiffened up, and fell back.'' Mr. Pickens hit his head on a cement walkway and began foaming at the mouth, Taylor said.  Sharon Landis, Taylor's mother and Mr. Pickens's wife, said officers did not need to shock her husband. ''They could have pepper-sprayed him, they could have grabbed him,'' she said. ''He's 55 years old, and these are big burly cops.''  Mr. Pickens was pronounced brain-dead that day and removed from life support three days later, Ms. Landis said.  Toxicologic tests on Mr. Pickens are being conducted, said Gayle Day of the Jefferson Parish coroner's office. A spokesman for the sheriff's office said he could not comment on a continuing investigation. Mr. Smith said he could not comment on Mr. Pickens's death.  Three weeks later, Kris Lieberman died in Pennsylvania. The officers who shocked him were the only witnesses to his death, which the Pennsylvania State Police are investigating. But Mr. Lieberman's parents said the state police told them that their son was shocked twice and collapsed afterward. [Stan Coopersmith, chief of the Bushkill Township Police, whose officers responded to the call, said he could not comment on the incident until the state police finish their investigation.] But Taser said that the police chief had told the company that Mr. Lieberman fought briefly after the shocks and that an automatic defibrillator used by the officers indicated Mr. Lieberman was not fibrillating when he collapsed.  ''I would suspect the autopsy will find a cause of death that does not include the Taser,'' Mr. Smith said.  Mr. Lieberman's parents say that he was troubled but that he did not use drugs. Police officers searched Mr. Lieberman's home after the shooting and did not find drugs, his parents say. Toxicologic tests are pending, the Northampton County Coroner said.  Mr. Lieberman's father, Richard, a plain-spoken farmer, said he had not decided whether to hire a lawyer. He simply wants to know if the gun caused his son's death. ''If he was the problem, we have to accept it,'' Mr. Lieberman said. ''If they were the problem, they have to accept it.''  Eric Dash contributed reporting from New York for this article. Summary: Growing number of people, now at least 50, have died since 2001 after being shocked by Taser stun gun; Taser International, which makes several versions of gun, contends its weapons are not lethal, even for people with heart conditions or pacemakers; contends deaths resulted from drug overdoses or other factors and would have occurred anyway; its primary safety studies on M26, which is far more powerful than other stun guns, consist of tests on single pig in 1996 and on five dogs in 1999; company-paid researchers, not independent scientists, conducted studies, which were never published in peer-reviewed journal; photo (M)",

            "input": "text:Tuesday is Equal Pay Day 2014so dubbed by the National Committee for Pay Equity, which represents feminist groups including the National Organization for Women, Feminist Majority, the National Council of Women's Organizations and others. The day falls on April 12 because, according to feminist logic, women have to work that far into a calendar year before they earn what men already earned the year before.  In years past, feminist leaders marked the occasion by rallying outside the U.S. Capitol to decry the pernicious wage gap and call for government action to address systematic discrimination against women. This year will be relatively quiet. Perhaps feminists feel awkward protesting a liberal-dominated government 2014or perhaps they know that the recent economic downturn has exposed as ridiculous their claims that our economy is ruled by a sexist patriarchy.  The unemployment rate is consistently higher among men than among women. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that 9.3% of men over the age of 16 are currently out of work. The figure for women is 8.3%. Unemployment fell for both sexes over the past year, but labor force participation (the percentage of working age people employed) also dropped. The participation rate fell more among men (to 70.4% today from 71.4% in March 2010) than women (to 58.3% from 58.8%). That means much of the improvement in unemployment numbers comes from discouraged workers 2014particularly male ones 2014giving up their job searches entirely.  Men have been hit harder by this recession because they tend to work in fields like construction, manufacturing and trucking, which are disproportionately affected by bad economic conditions. Women cluster in more insulated occupations, such as teaching, health care and service industries.  Yet if you can accept that the job choices of men and women lead to different unemployment rates, then you shouldn't be surprised by other differences 2014like differences in average pay.  Feminist hand-wringing about the wage gap relies on the assumption that the differences in average earnings stem from discrimination. Thus the mantra that women make only 77% of what men earn for equal work. But even a cursory review of the data proves this assumption false.  The Department of Labor's Time Use survey shows that full-time working women spend an average of 8.01 hours per day on the job, compared to 8.75 hours for full-time working men. One would expect that someone who works 9% more would also earn more. This one fact alone accounts for more than a third of the wage gap.  Choice of occupation also plays an important role in earnings. While feminists suggest that women are coerced into lower-paying job sectors, most women know that something else is often at work. Women gravitate toward jobs with fewer risks, more comfortable conditions, regular hours, more personal fulfillment and greater flexibility. Simply put, many women 2014not all, but enough to have a big impact on the statistics 2014are willing to trade higher pay for other desirable job characteristics.  Men, by contrast, often take on jobs that involve physical labor, outdoor work, overnight shifts and dangerous conditions (which is also why men suffer the overwhelming majority of injuries and deaths at the workplace). They put up with these unpleasant factors so that they can earn more.  Recent studies have shown that the wage gap shrinks 2014or even reverses 2014when relevant factors are taken into account and comparisons are made between men and women in similar circumstances. In a 2010 study of single, childless urban workers between the ages of 22 and 30, the research firm Reach Advisors found that women earned an average of 8% more than their male counterparts. Given that women are outpacing men in educational attainment, and that our economy is increasingly geared toward knowledge-based jobs, it makes sense that women's earnings are going up compared to men's.  Should we celebrate the closing of the wage gap? Certainly it's good news that women are increasingly productive workers, but women whose husbands and sons are out of work or under-employed are likely to have a different perspective. After all, many American women wish they could work less, and that they weren't the primary earners for their families.  Few Americans see the economy as a battle between the sexes. They want opportunity to abound so that men and women can find satisfying work situations that meet their unique needs. That 2014not a day dedicated to manufactured feminist grievances 2014would be something to celebrate.  Ms. Lukas is executive director of the Independent Women's Forum. Summary: In The Wall Street Journal, Carrie Lukas of the Independent Women's Forum writes that a study of single, childless urban workers between the ages of 22 and 30 found that women earned 8% more than men.",

The US congressional committee report found Australia has been targeted by more IS-linked terrorism plots than Belgium, Israel and Germany over the last two years.  Justice Minister Michael Keenan said the report confirmed the view of local authorities.   What I can say is that there is no country that is better prepared to deal with the threat of global terrorism than Australia,  he told reporters in Adelaide on Thursday.  The Australian Parliament is due to pass a fifth tranche of counter terrorism laws when MPs sit later this month.  According to the report, the US was the top target among western nations with 41, France was second with 20 and Australia and the United Kingdom were equal third with eight.  The US House Committee on Homeland Security report describes the 100-plus attacks against western countries since 2014 as  an unprecedented wave of terror .   ISIS-linked attacks against the west have been responsible for more than 1600 casualties since 2014,  the committee's report states.   The three highest-casualty attacks all occurred within the past year, including the November assault in Paris (480 people), the attack in Brussels (335 people), and the recent truck massacre in Nice (286 people).   Belgium was fifth on the list with seven IS-linked terrorism plots while Germany and Spain were next with five.  Israel and Indonesia both had one.  The report found 89 per cent of suspects were military-aged males, with the average age 26, and attacks were getting deadlier and more destructive with the average number of casualties per attack jumping the last year from 48 to 58.  Most of the terror group's external operations were carried out by independent followers inspired by IS, rather than those who worked for the group directly.  US authorities, according to the report, have identified individuals tied to terrorism in Syria who have attempted to enter the US as refugees.   Refugee flows have become a key pathway for terrorists to expand their reach into western countries,  the report states.   ISIS has advanced its operations by infiltrating operatives into the flow of refugees from the Middle East, including to plan attacks in Belgium, France, Germany, and Turkey.

            "input": "text:Every major mobile network and high street retailer will try to sell insurance to customers when they are buying new phones. Some networks charge as much as  00a315 a month  2013 or  00a3180 a year  2013 to insure the latest smartphones. Yet despite the costly premiums, research has shown that only one in five policyholders has ever made a claim.  When choosing mobile phone insurance, price is often the first thing we consider. For instance, it costs  00a312.50 a month to insure an iPhone 5 16GB with O2, and you will need to pay an excess of  00a360 if you need to replace the handset. However, if you make a second claim the excess doubles to  00a3120. So a year's worth of premiums plus one replacement phone would cost you  00a3210  2013 just under half the cost of a new handset.  However, making sure you are properly insured is harder than you might think. Many policies are riddled with exclusions. For example, it may not cover you for any calls made when your phone is lost or stolen.  It is crucial that you also comply with the conditions set out by the insurer, or you might be left out of pocket with a policy that will not pay out. For example, if your handset is stolen, you must tell the provider to bar the phone and contact the police to report the theft and get a crime reference number.  If you are one of the 20 million consumers who have home contents insurance, it is possible that your mobile phone is already covered  2013 so check before buying a separate policy from your network.  But research from statisticians Defaqto shows that the cover within home insurance can be limited and may vary according to where the phone is kept. For example, nine out of 10 policies automatically provide cover for mobile phones when they are within the home, but the number of policies that automatically provide cover outside the home is lower.   If you have 'away from home' cover on your contents insurance, you may be able to claim on that if your phone is lost or stolen while you're out,  said Mark Greening of Gocompare.com, the comparison service.  Away from home cover is an optional extra on most standard home contents policies, but it doesn't necessarily add a lot to your premium if it doesn't come as standard. It's important that you check any single article limits that might apply to the policy.  For example, this might limit payouts for any one item to just  00a3500  2013 which wouldn't necessarily cover the cost of replacing the latest smartphone.  Getting cover on your home insurance might be cheapest in the short term, but a claim is likely to push up your premiums in future.  A relatively small claim of a few hundred pounds may have a knock-on effect on the cost of your household insurance, which could be substantially more expensive,  said Mr Greening.  Millions of mobile users may be paying twice for insurance, as your phone may already be covered through a  packaged  (paid-for) bank account. Figures from Defaqto show that 71pc of packaged accounts include mobile phone insurance. Always check the level of cover, as it can vary. On its website, Defaqto analyses the quality of various financial products, including mobile phone insurance. For example, if you are looking for basic insurance cover, you may want to consider a product with one or two stars. But if you want a  Rolls-Royce  product  2013 which includes replacements for damaged phones, for example  2013 the more comprehensive policies have a higher star rating. See Defaqto.com for details. Bank of Scotland's range of Vantage current accounts, for instance, provides five-star cover with monthly prices ranging from  00a37.95 to  00a325. Keep in mind that you must register your handset in advance.  The cheapest deals usually come from stand-alone policies. You can also ensure that you are getting the level of cover that matches your needs. For instance, Protect Your Bubble (protectyourbubble.com) offers annual cover for an iPhone 5 16GB for  00a35.99 a month. This offers worldwide cover for theft and breakdown, as well as accidental and liquid damage. However, if you lose your phone, it will not be replaced unless you have selected this as an add-on for an extra  00a31 a month.  One way it keeps premiums down is to choose a policy that offers replacements that are refurbished rather than brand new. In some cases, customers will be offered phones of a  comparable specification  rather than an exact replacement. Given the cost savings, some people are happy to accept that. Summary: We explain how to make sure you are properly insured, and how to pay as little   as possible for the handset.",

            "input": "text:San Jose's homes are historically expensive.  According to data out Wednesday from the National Association of Realtors, the median price of a home in the California city is now over $1 million  2014 $1,85,000 to be exact  2014 the first time that the group has registered such a high figure in a metro area.  All in all, during the second quarter, home prices increased in 83% of the 178 metro areas that NAR tracks, and the average price of a single-family home nationwide increased 4.9% year-over-year, to $240,700.  The rise in prices also highlighted the vast shortage of homes being built, according to Lawrence Yun, the chief economist for NAR.   However, with homebuilding activity still failing to keep up with demand and not enough current homeowners putting their home up for sale, prices continued their strong ascent  2014 and in many markets at a rate well above income growth,  Yun said in the report.  We've highlighted this problem numerous times, dubbing it  the new housing crisis,  and the NAR data reiterates that the supply of homes on the market  2014 both new and existing  2014 is running well below demand, pushing prices up and keeping first-time homebuyers out of the market.  Yun noted that the rate of new homes coming onto the market is well under the average for most recovery periods, and as incomes and wages rise, more people are looking to buy homes. Couple that with people in existing homes being disincentivized to move, and you get bidding wars that push prices out of many buyers' range.   Many listings in a majority of markets  2014 and especially those in lower price ranges  2014 had multiple offers and went under contract quickly because of severely inadequate supply,  Yun said in the report.  This in turn dented affordability and without a doubt priced out a segment of buyers attempting to seek relief from fast-growing rents.   This problem was also reflected in the affordability index from NAR:   Despite falling mortgage rates and a small increase in the national family median income ($68,774), swiftly rising home prices caused affordability to decline in the second quarter compared to a year ago. To purchase a single-family home at the national median price, a buyer making a 5 percent down payment would need an income of $52,255, a 10 percent down payment would require an income of $49,504, and $44,004 would be needed for a 20 percent down payment.   While San Jose may be a bit of an outlier, it certainly reflects just how expensive things are becoming for American homebuyers.

Newlyweds Erik and Brandi Quam can 2019t really afford their home.

It 2019s already a tight squeeze: They 2019ve taken in a roommate to help pay the bills. Unfortunately, they can 2019t afford to sell either.

The irony is that the Quams should be able to afford their place: It cost just $219,000 when a still-single Brandi, fresh out of the Air Force, bought it.  So how did they get themselves in such a mess? More puzzling still, why did lenders let them 2014along with millions of other homeowners, many of whom, unlike the Quams, are in immediate danger of foreclosure?  In the answer to that question lies the real story behind the once dizzying, now fizzling housing boom. Sure, record-low interest rates, boomers buying vacation homes and immigrants grabbing for the American dream all did their bit to push up prices. But what really supercharged the market was the mortgage industrial complex 2014a machine with cogs called brokers and bankers, fueled by money poured in by investment banks, bond traders and hedge fund managers. The system prospered and grew, introducing new players into the financing transaction and transforming the roles of others. Finally it ran amok, creating huge incentives at every level of a home sale or a refi to sacrifice prudence in pursuit of a killing. Market checks and balances should have prevented the process from getting out of control. But they were corrupted, co-opted or simply steamrollered. For example:  Too much money. Too little restraint. This is the story of how all the important players in the market decided that they had too much at stake to shout,  201cStop! 201d We 2019ve been here before: Remember when Wall Street analysts told us Amazon.com was worth $400 a share?

That could be a drag on the economy. It 2019s already a real drag for the Quams.  The primary mortgage on the Quams 2019 condo was fixed at 5.25%. But Brandi had also taken out a smaller variable-rate loan. As rates rose in 2005, she went looking for a better deal and entered her contact information into a few websites. Shortly thereafter, she says, she got a call from broker Robert Hoover of CPA Mortgage in Maryland. He found her a new loan with what she says she understood to be an initial 1% rate, with only small increases in the first five years. And since she had equity (her condo had appreciated), she could even take a little cash out to pay off some bills. The transaction earned the broker and his firm about $12,600.  It took a few months before Brandi realized what she had done. The mortgage was something called an option ARM. It was true that Brandi could make initial minimum payments of about $800. But those weren 2019t enough to cover the interest she was actually being charged, which was higher than the rate used to calculate required payments. The unpaid interest was added to the loan balance, a phenomenon called negative amortization. The Quams have decided to start paying at least the interest on the loan, but even so, the balance has grown by $7,000. Barring a market turnaround, they 2019re stuck for at least another year and a half until the prepayment penalty phases out. They 2019ve had to turn down job offers because they can 2019t move.  Who is to blame here? Yes, Brandi should have asked more questions and scrutinized the fine print. The idea of a mortgage with a 1% rate seems, on its face, too good to be true. Brandi says she did know she 2019d eventually have to make higher payments, but she planned to move before that happened. Exactly how Hoover described the mechanics of the loan, or what she thought he meant, is impossible to know for sure now. Hoover declined to speak with MONEY, and his firm sent an e-mail saying that it couldn 2019t comment on a client but that  201cultimately, it is the consumer that makes the choice they feel is best. 201d  But based on the documents Brandi showed us for her loan 2014and documents MONEY has seen for other option ARMS 2014it is easy to see how a person could be confused. A payment schedule is shown on the federally mandated truth-in-lending form, but it is based on minimum payments and a steady interest rate, rather than the variable rate the Quams are charged. An  201cadjustable-rate note 201d first says the Quams will be charged a yearly rate of 1%. The next subsection says that rate  201cmay 201d change almost immediately. The first payment coupons show only the minimum, negatively amortizing payment.  A spokeswoman for the original lender, BankUnited of Miami Lakes, Fla., said she couldn 2019t specifically comment on Brandi 2019s loan. But she said that borrowers aren 2019t approved unless their  201ccredit score will support the fully indexed rate. 201d All borrowers, she added, acknowledge receipt of numerous documents disclosing every aspect of the loan, including a four-page form that describes the terms  201cin plain English 201d and warns borrowers of the possibility of negative amortization.  Keep in mind, complex loans like option ARMs are new to most people, and they are radically different from 15- and 30-year fixed-rate loans. Consumer advocates say that the truth-in-lending disclosure rules are outdated and that borrowers like the Quams are being asked to climb a steep learning curve 2014with their homes at stake.  201cThe disclosures on adjustable-rate mortgages have never been any good, and option ARMs are particularly terrible, 201d says Jack Guttentag, professor emeritus of finance at the University of Pennsylvania 2019s Wharton School.  In any case, the loans are popular. In the first half of 2006, option ARMs were 15% of mortgage originations, reports the Mortgage Bankers Association. In theory, the loan can be a useful tool for people with irregular income, such as entrepreneurs. But low payments are the rule, not the exception. Today more than 80% of borrowers in securitized option ARMs pay less than their interest charges, according to Fitch Ratings. Their loan balances are rising. That might not be so bad in a rising market, but it 2019s potentially a disaster in a falling one.  It 2019s obvious that a lot of homeowners could have used better advice about how to find an affordable loan. But good advice has gotten harder to come by in the mortgage game. That 2019s because the person across the desk or on the other end of the telephone getting you a mortgage probably doesn 2019t work for the bank that 2019s putting up the money. He may not care if you can pay.  201cConsumers thought that when they qualified for a loan, that meant they had a reasonable prospect to repay the loan unless some type of illness or catastrophe hit the family, 201d says Michael Calhoun, president of the Center for Responsible Lending.  201cThat is no longer the case. 201d  Morning commuters in Boston, Chicago and Phoenix are slapped awake by the voice of a pugnacious Texan shouting out of the radio.  201cWhen your mortgage payment goes up 400 bucks a month, you can dislocate your jaw and swallow it like a snake eatin 2019 an egg, 201d the voice says.  201cOr spend another seven grand and have some predator redo your mortgage. Unacceptable. 201d The voice belongs to Jon Shibley,39, the president of Lenox Financial Mortgage. Over 13 years he 2019s built his business from a one-man shop in Atlanta into a 200-employee company that arranges mortgages and refinancings in 24 states.  Up until the 1980s, when the savings-and-loan crisis brought the old system crashing down, getting a mortgage typically meant sitting down with a loan officer from a local lender, which cared a lot about your ability to pay. Today about 70% of mortgages are originated by a mortgage broker. It 2019s an intense, fast-moving business and suits the hypercharged Shibley just fine. Shibley meditates 20 minutes a day but also claims that he will occasionally burn himself or immerse his body in ice water 2014 201da shock to the system, 201d he calls it, that keeps him engaged. Shibley doesn 2019t rely on word-of-mouth or community roots. He drives his business with in-your-face advertising. These days, as his commercials show, his sales targets include borrowers looking to escape onerous payment hikes on their variable-rate mortgages.  201cPeople don 2019t know who to call, 201d he says.  201cThat 2019s why my marketing philosophy has been so successful. 201d  For better and for worse, the new mortgage sales machine made it much easier to get a loan. And if a mortgage option was mathematically possible, a broker made sure you knew about it. He or she could get you a low annual rate, help you avoid a down payment or find you a super-low initial monthly payment. Shibley 2019s particular pitch is  201cno closing costs, 201d which looks to be an easy sell to borrowers suddenly short on cash.  201cThis industry is a disaster, 201d he says. All these mortgage options can make sense in certain circumstances and hurt you in others. (You may actually prefer to pay closing costs, for example, if that gets you a lower rate and you plan to stay in the loan long enough to work off the costs.) The tricky part is figuring out which loan works for you.  A good mortgage broker can help you do that, and Shibley says that 2019s what his people do. But not all brokers will. Brokers can be paid more if they can convince you to pay a higher rate than you qualify for, or borrow more money than you need. And they resist efforts by lawmakers to give them a fiduciary obligation to act in the borrower 2019s best interest.  201cWe do not solely represent the consumer, 201d says George Hanzimanolis, president-elect of the National Association of Mortgage Brokers.  In short, it 2019s best to shop around 2014and it 2019s easy enough to do that on a basic fixed-rate mortgage. It 2019s a lot harder to comparison-shop loans with payment options and variable rates, which is why brokers love to sell them. With option ARMs, borrowers tend to focus on the introductory rate and minimum payment, and to ignore the higher rate down the road. For the broker that higher rate could mean the difference between a $3,000 commission and one several times as large.  201cOption ARMs are not a license to steal, but once a customer asks for it, I know I 2019m going to make four times as much, 201d says Jim Moore, a Grand Rapids broker who writes about his business at miamibeach411.com, speaking by cell phone.  201cIt 2019s what puts me down here at Best Buy buying a 40-inch flat screen. 201d  Even then there are usually limits to how much your broker can get out of you. After all, a mortgage is based on the value of your house. But maybe there 2019s a way around that too.  Last summer Daniel Kim was feeling pinched. So when Kim, now 27, of San Leandro, Calif. got a call from a mortgage company, he was intrigued. The loan officer, Mia Yi of ALG Capital, sold Kim on refinancing, putting him an additional $81,000 in debt on his house. Kim says he was surprised he could borrow more. He had bought the two-bedroom the previous year for $560,000 with no money down, and everything he had read said the market in his area was cooling. But after Yi produced an appraisal in November that said his house was worth $642,0, Kim signed.  201cI was excited, 201d he says,  201cthat my house had appreciated that much. 201d  Appraising the value of a house has never been an exact science. But the $4-billion-a-year appraisal industry provides a crucial reality check for the system. Banks need an appraisal to make a loan. Regulators and mortgage investors require it to insure against fraud. Consumers rely on appraisals to give them some measure of confidence they aren 2019t paying too much. In refinancings, the appraisal is the only thing that tells a consumer what a house is worth and how much he can borrow.  So perhaps it 2019s not surprising that appraisers have come under pressure from some of the people selling mortgages. MONEY has obtained more than 100 e-mails and faxes sent by loan officers to appraisers across the country. The language varies from asking if a predetermined value was possible to promising more business if a number could be hit.  201cMany homeowners are finding out that the equity they were led to believe they had in their house is not actually there, 201d says John Taylor, president of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition.  According to an appraiser MONEY hired, Kim 2019s house is worth only $580,000 and was at the time he refinanced the house. Yes, different appraisers often have different takes. In Kim 2019s case the appraisers disagree about whether an enclosed porch counts as part of the total square footage. But ALG 2019s Yi strongly suggested to appraisers what the answer ought to be. In an e-mail she sent to numerous appraisers, Yi said she needed  201ca value of $650,000 or more. Please let me know ASAP with max value. 201d Five days later Paul Chasteen, an appraiser in Discovery Bay, produced the appraisal that led to Kim 2019s $642,000 mortgage, less than Yi wanted but enough to do a deal. ALG got him loans for the full appraised value. The result: Kim now owes $62,000 more than his house may be worth. Kim put the money from the refinancing into a dry-cleaning business and paying off a car loan. He can 2019t move without foreclosing.  201cIt 2019s not a good feeling, 201d he says.  Yi declined to comment. ALG owner Crystal Palomino said two appraisers (from the same firm) reviewed the value, as did the funding bank. Chasteen says he and his fellow appraisers are under the gun because as many as 10 competitors may get the same order. Referring to that pressure, Chasteen says,  201cIs there a problem out there? You bet there is. 201d He adds, though, that he resists and that in Kim 2019s case pressure wasn 2019t an issue.  201cI never push values, 201d he says.  Appraiser Ray Miller of Lyndon Station, Wis. also says he doesn 2019t inflate values but complains that he is asked to do so daily. Miller says he doesn 2019t always give the preferred answer, which hurts business.  201cIf I don 2019t hit the number they are asking for, I almost never hear from that loan officer again, 201d he says.  201cBut if you don 2019t accept these orders at all, you won 2019t have any business. 201d  Brokers sometimes ask for a  201ccomp check. 201d They don 2019t ask for a target price, but get a number of appraisers to guess what a property is worth, sight unseen, before ordering.  201cAppraisers who do comp checks know that they have to inflate values to get the order and get paid, 201d says Pamela Crowley, a former appraiser who recently launched a site to catalogue lending abuses, MortgageFraudWatchList.org.  Hanzimanolis of NAMB says appraisal pressure isn 2019t a big problem. His organization amended its code of ethics last year to prohibit members from squeezing appraisers.  201cI don 2019t see how anybody but the appraiser is responsible for an inflated or fraudulent appraisal, 201d he says.  A number of states, including Colorado, are mulling laws that would make it clearly illegal to pressure appraisers. Jonathan Miller (no relation to Ray), owner of New York City 2019s Miller Samuel and one of the nation 2019s most prominent appraisers, argues that such laws are sorely needed.  201cUnder the current system, 201d he says,  201cthere is really no point to a mortgage appraisal anymore. 201d You might expect that those ultimately on the hook if a borrower fails to pay would take an interest in making sure that the collateral was really worth its appraised value. But until the past few months, you 2019d have been wrong.  The housing boom was good to John Devaney. Really good. He owns a Rolls-Royce, a Gulfstream Jet, a 12,000-square-foot mansion in Key Biscayne and a 143-foot yacht, as well as a few Renoirs and a valuable 1823 reproduction of the Declaration of Independence. Devaney 2019s not a developer, and he 2019s certainly not a flipper. The 36-year-old CEO of United Capital Markets is a bond trader. And one of his specialties is buying and selling bonds that are backed by the mortgage payments of ordinary homeowners. Option ARMs? Devaney loves  2019em.  201cThe consumer has to be an idiot to take on those loans, 201d he says.  201cBut it has been one of our best-performing investments. 201d  Devaney 2019s not out to get people into bad loans 2014or into good ones. He just makes bets on how many people will repay and when. Still, the $5.7 trillion mortgage-backed-securities market had a key role in today 2019s housing mess.  201cThe broker and the lender and everybody else in between is part of a factory that 2019s producing bond securities for Wall Street, 201d said attorney and consumer advocate Irv Acklesberg in testimony before a Senate committee recently. On the other hand, the fact that Devaney and other investors are willing to own mortgages may also be one of the reasons you could afford your house.  Banks have been selling off their mortgages to the bond market since the 1970s. Bond investors get the borrowers 2019 monthly payments and the promise that they will be paid back, while banks get immediate cash and the chance to unload some risk. All this makes it easier for them to make new loans 2014good news for most borrowers. The trouble is, Wall Street 2019s rocket scientists keep finding more sophisticated ways to repackage and resell mortgages. As a result, lenders stopped worrying so much about credit standards and learned to love risky loans.  Look, for example, at the financial Frankenstein 2019s monster known as the collateralized debt obligation, or CDO. Brought to life in the 1990s, the CDO helped solve a knotty problem for lenders. They were often left holding a small amount of loans that were too dodgy to sell to investors at an attractive price. But what if you grouped the payments from all those risky mortgages together, along with some other investments, and you sold some investors the right to be the first ones to get paid? This would look like a relatively safe investment, and so 2014voil 00e0! 2014you 2019ve transformed a risky loan into a triple-A rated security. Other investors would be farther back in line and might not get paid if things went badly. But you could offer those investors very high yields, so that hedge funds and pension funds would roll the dice.  This set the whole mortgage-bond sector on fire. Banks rushed to make mortgages 2014any kind of mortgages. Lousy credit? No problem. Can 2019t prove your income? No problem. Can 2019t pay more than 1% now? No problem.  Now a lot of that lending looks foolish. Mortgage delinquencies among so-called subprime borrowers have risen to 13%, the highest in at least 10 years. The market for the lowest-credit-quality mortgage bonds has tanked. And investors in CDOs may be in for a rude shock.  201cSome of the investors who bought CDOs certainly took on more risk than they thought, 201d says John Weicher, a former assistant secretary of housing now at the Hudson Institute. But Devaney, who told a crowd of investors that the riskiest mortgage bonds looked  201cawful 201d before the crash, says he thinks he 2019ll be buying.  201cI don 2019t believe the carnage and fallout will be as bad as people think, 201d he says.  Whether or not big investors come out okay, the damage is done for many homeowners.  201cThe system allowed banks to create unsustainable loans that are going to haunt borrowers for years to come, 201d says Allen Fishbein, director of credit and housing policy at the Consumer Federation of America.  201cUnlike the bank, the borrower has no way to lay off the risk. 201d  What comes next? The pullback. Investors will be more selective about where they put their money, and banks will be more cautious in their lending. That 2019s basically healthy. But the risk is that this will happen so fast that we 2019ll see a vicious circle develop: Falling home prices mean less credit, and less credit means fewer buyers and, hence, falling home prices. That could make a housing recovery that much harder to come by. For the Quams, one can 2019t come soon enough.  201cI worked so hard to be a homeowner, and now my dumb decision with this loan may take it all away, 201d says Brandi.  201cWe are newlyweds, bleeding money like crazy, and there are no Band-Aids. 201d  Read Next: Money 101: Buying a Home Summary: As  The Big Short  hits theaters, we go back in time to 2007 and meet the folks who were living through it.",

More than 130 organisations from across the world have backed the 00c2 Syrian Civil Defence, also known as 00c2 the White Helmets, whose members brave bombings and sniper fire to provide medical treatment for the wounded in rebel-controlled areas, to win the prestigious international award for peace efforts.  The Syria Campaign, an international human rights group advocating for the protection of civilians in the country, has 00c2 launched an initiative  00c2 calling for the White Helmets to win the prize. The winner will be announced on October 7.   Their efforts to save lives in the most dangerous place on earth are awe-inspiring, and merit the deepest respect.   Wendy Chamberlin, Middle East Institute  Former bakers, tailors, engineers, painters and pharmacists are among the organisation's members, who pledge to help anyone in need regardless of religious or political affiliations.  The group's 3,000 members operate across the country, including the governorates of Aleppo, Idlib, Latakia, Homs, Deraa and Damascus.  Ammar Aosalmo, a senior member of the group's branch in Aleppo, told Al Jazeera that at least 134 members have died on duty and explained his motivation for risking his life for others by saying the group was viewed by many as their last hope.  He cited the White Helmets' motto - taken from Islam's holiest book, the Quran:  To save a life is to save all of humanity.    People trust in us. When we look into their eyes we see that they need help ... when  00c2 Aleppo was under siege , people felt they were more safe with us around.   When asked whether his group had any method of notifying Russian and Syrian military fighter jets of their presence to avoid being hit by their bombs, he accused them of targeting the White Helmets.   Four of our centres were hit by Russian aircraft in the last month,  he said.  He also said subsequent attacks on the same location were the main reason the group's members were killed on duty.   We try to intercept aircraft signals to tell volunteers to get out because they will target the place again,  he added.  Raed Al Saleh, head of the group, has called on the UN Security Council to help impose a  no-fly zone  to facilitate their rescue efforts.   Barrel bombs - sometimes filled with chlorine - are the biggest killer of civilians in Syria today,  he said.   Our unarmed and neutral rescue workers have saved more than 60,000 people from the attacks in Syria, but there are many we cannot reach. There are children trapped in rubble we cannot hear. For them, the UN Security Council must follow through on its demand to stop the barrel bombs, by introducing a 'no-fly zone' if necessary.  00c2  Wendy Chamberlin, president of the Middle East Institute, who is one of  00c2 those who nominated the White Helmets for the Nobel Prize, told Al Jazeera why she believed the group deserved the accolade.  READ MORE: Q&A - Syria's White Helmets   As an American citizen who believes the fundamental duty of government is to protect its citizens, I am appalled by the actions of the Syrian regime, which deliberately targets humanitarian hospitals and drops chemical and barrel bombs on its own civilians,  she said.   Yet in the face of such horrors, the courageous and compassionate response of a group of Syrian volunteers is indeed inspirational.   The White Helmets are a neutral, all-volunteer organisation of nearly 3,000 Syrian civilians who act as first responders in a country where public services no longer function. Unpaid and unarmed, the White Helmets rush into bomb sites to rescue fellow Syrians from the rubble, regardless of religion or politics.   The White Helmets provide medical attention, emergency shelter, and safety information to nearly seven million people. They are the largest civil society organisation operating in areas outside Syrian government control, and their actions provide hope for millions.

Senior ministers have also sought to highlight the LNP's apparent willingness to leave the door open for One Nation preference deals.  Ms Trad told a Queensland Media Club lunch on Friday that mutual understanding and respect were key to attracting foreign investment.

Mr Baird told reporters the drop in votes was expected given the high levels in the 2012 elections and he trusted voters to distinguish between the different levels of government.   In any election there's a range of issues that play out and I strongly believe the community is very well able to determine what are local, state and federal government issues,  he said on Monday.  Labor enjoyed strong results in the western Sydney local government areas of Liverpool, Penrith, the Blue Mountains, Blacktown, Campbelltown and Camden.  The results reflected a  stinging rebuff  of the coalition government, Opposition Leader Luke Foley said on Sunday.   The people of western Sydney and across NSW have sent a message to (Premier) Mike Baird,  he said.   They've had enough of his high-handed, arrogant behaviour.   The coalition would be wiped from office if the swings were replicated at the state election, Mr Foley said. Summary: NSW Premier Mike Baird has shrugged off suggestions his decision to ban the greyhound racing industry hurt the Liberal party in local elections.",

            "input": "text:After the twin barrages of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita last year, the City of New Orleans emerged nearly 64 percent smaller, having lost an estimated 278,833 residents, according to the Census Bureau's first study of the area since the storms.  Those who remained in the city were significantly more likely to be white, slightly older and a bit more well-off, the bureau concluded in two reports that were its first effort to measure the social, financial and demographic impact of the hurricanes on the Gulf Coast.  The bureau found that while New Orleans lost about two-thirds of its population, adjacent St. Bernard Parish dropped a full 95 percent, falling to just 3,361 residents by Jan. 1. The surveys do not include the influx in both areas that has occurred this year as more residents begin to rebuild.  While the New Orleans area lost population, the Houston metropolitan area emerged with more than 130,000 new residents, many of them hurricane evacuees. Whites made up a slightly smaller percentage of Houston's population  0097 62.8 percent of the city in January compared with 64.8 percent last July, a month before Hurricane Katrina hit.  In Harris County, which includes Houston, median household income fell to $43,044 from $44,517, while New Orleans area's actually rose, to $43,447 from $39,793.  The physical impact of the hurricanes is well documented. Now, with these reports, bureau officials said they hoped to begin drawing into sharper focus the human landscape, showing in stark statistics how the storm's impact was felt most keenly by the poor, members of minorities and renters.   One of the keys for me is that the data we are seeing really supports the anecdotal stories we've been hearing for months,  said Lisa Blumerman, deputy chief of the bureau's American Community Survey.  We now have quantitative data that supports the stories from the storm.   One of the reports looked solely at population gains and losses, while the second studied demographic shifts before and after the storm.  The reports' findings had been expected, said William H. Frey, a demographer for the Brookings Institution. Still, he said, there were some small surprises.  It was not only New Orleans but also the entire metropolitan region that became whiter, less poor and more mobile, Mr. Frey said. At the same time, he said, assumptions that the evacuees who went to nearby Baton Rouge, where the population grew by nearly 15,0, were disproportionately poor and black were proven incorrect. A more middle-class group settled there, while the poorer and more vulnerable, who had less choice about where they landed, went to more distant cities.  Demographers in the affected states said yesterday that they were skeptical of some of the methodology in the studies, wary of the results and unsure how helpful the reports would be in measuring the human impact of the storms. Steve Murdock, the state demographer of Texas, said the studies underestimated the number of hurricane evacuees in Houston by limiting their measurements to individual households and failing to count people living in hotels, shelters and other group environments.   I can tell you that I learned nothing new about Texas,  Mr. Murdock said.  These are very limited data. The truth is, nobody knows how good this data really is.   Caroline Leung, an economic researcher at Louisiana Tech University, said she had been trying to reconcile some conflicting data in the two reports and came away confused. The underlying trends may be valid, Ms. Leung said,  but I would not rely too much on those population numbers.   Census officials emphasized that the special reports used a somewhat different methodology than typical bureau studies, saying some of the numbers might be slightly less concrete than normal.   But we felt the need to do this quickly, because the impact of the hurricanes on the Gulf Coast population is really without precedent,  said Enrique Lamas, chief of the bureau's population division.  Of the 117 counties and parishes used in the studies  0097 those identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as eligible for disaster assistance  0097 only 40 lost population in the four months after the storm, and 99 percent of the losses came in the top 10 parishes and counties, comprising New Orleans and Lake Charles in Louisiana and Gulfport and Biloxi in Mississippi.  The black population of the New Orleans metropolitan area fell to 21 percent from 36 percent, the bureau found. Summary: New Orleans is nearly 64 percent smaller, according to a Census Bureau study.",

            "input": "text:AMES KEATING marked the dissolution of his first marriage with the purchase of a black leather couch -  a bachelor's black leather couch,  Mr. Keating said. This decision led to his formulating the Black Leather Couch Theory, under which he conducted his nascent romantic life.   The idea was this,  he said.  I'd know when I'd met the perfect woman when I would be willing to part with the black leather couch.  He did meet the perfect woman - and then they both met the very imperfect apartment.  After a year or so, Mr. Keating, now 35, encountered Verena Schenk, now 33, albeit virtually, at Lavalife.com, an online dating service. He liked her smile and her screen name, which was Verendipity; she deemed him to be  nonfreaky,  as she put it, and refreshingly normal. One thing led to another, and Mr. Keating and Ms. Schenk found themselves falling in love.  Eager to fulfill the destiny prescribed by the Black Leather Couch Theory, which encouraged a full exploration of any probable relationship, Mr. Keating traveled to the apartment of his newly beloved, only to discover - her black leather couch. He was stunned:  It was the bachelorette black leather couch,  he said.  This coincidence was one of many - both had been married and divorced in the same period, both had been in Ms. Schenk's hometown of Hanau, Germany, at the same time, and both had moved to New York City at the same time, he from Dunmore, Pa. Their parallel lives held another significant detail: synchronized leases. Ms. Schenk, who was living in Murray Hill, had a lease running out in June. Mr. Keating, who lived in the financial district, had a lease up in August. (She has worked in commercial real estate; he is a business consultant.)  The two decided to make the leap, and move in together. Here is where their Arcadia ends, and the story turns dark: well, just the real estate part.  The cosmos was going to spin on its head as Verena and James started their new life together,  said Mr. Keating mock-portentously.  Instead, it was a cosmic cataclysm.   One weekend last May, they were shown a model of a two-bedroom apartment at the Crest, the luxury rental development at 63 Wall Street. This massive double-trapezium of a building, built in 1929, is planted halfway down the canyon of Wall Street, past the tourists posing in front of the statue of George Washington, past the American Stock Exchange, past the designer condos at 23 Wall Street - the building also known as Downtown by Philippe Starck - and past the old Regent Hotel, also scheduled for condo development. The Crest, the former Brown Brothers Harriman & Company headquarters building, intones the same basso profundo authority as its neighbors: it's the solemn architecture of money.  In another  meant-to-be moment,  Ms. Schenk said, it turned out that only one two-bedroom in the 470-plus-unit building was still available, the result of someone dropping out at the last minute. In May, the Crest was still a construction zone, so the couple toured a model unit. Though its proposed maple parquet floors were covered in wall-to-wall carpeting, the rest of the apartment was said to be the twin of  their'' two-bedroom: there was a granite and stainless-steel kitchen with a breakfast bar, ample closets and great light. The rent would be $3,725 a month, a bit steep for the area, but the developers offered all sorts of incentives: two months' rent free with a one-year lease, or three with a two-year lease, as well as free moving services.  Mr. Keating and Ms. Schenk signed on, opting for two years, and mapped out a move for July 22.  We were super-excited to start our life together,  said Ms. Schenk, who speaks with the same dry humor as Mr. Keating.  We couldn't wait. Our calendars and Palms said, 'The Crest! Move-in Day!'    On July 17, they celebrated Ms. Schenk's birthday at a restaurant in the West Village; afterward, euphoric from the evening, and anticipating their future, they took a subway down to their new home.  The Crest was pitch black.   I said to James, 'I have a feeling this move isn't going to happen,'   Ms. Schenk reported. Summary: When James Keating and Verena Schenk moved into their $3,750-a-month rental, they expected pure luxury. Instead they got buckled floors and other problems.",

            "input": "text:a Ali G Show,  the British comic Sacha Baron Cohen's HBO series, returns for its second American season on Sunday.  While playing the part of Ali G, an imbecilic and gonzo rapper who speaks in Caribbean-British slang, Mr. Baron Cohen in the first few episodes interviews Pat Buchanan, Sam Donaldson and Gore Vidal. For all the publicity that Ali G received in his initial HBO season, in which he put on the likes of Newt Gingrich, the former astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin Jr. and the former director of central intelligence R. James Woolsey, none of this season's august figures managed to see their disguised interviewer for who he is: a wickedly smart, left-wing comedian and practicing Jew with a degree from Cambridge.  In man-on-the-street interviews and other stunts this season, Mr. Baron Cohen also reprises the characters of Borat, an unwashed, leering Kazakh, and Bruno, an Austrian gadfly from the fashion world. Typically averse to talking out of costume and character, Mr. Baron Cohen still sat down this week to discuss his approach to satire, his fear of America and the secret wild ways of Boutros Boutros-Ghali. Here are excerpts.  VIRGINIA HEFFERNAN Why is Ali G so funny?  SACHA BARON COHEN It's a pretty simple joke, which is why even some kids get it. Essentially you have two people who look totally different  0097 one guy dressed in an absurd yellow jumpsuit, and the other guys dressed in a suit. They're speaking in different ways, with different body language and totally different levels of intelligence.  HEFFERNAN Is it more fun to play pranks on British people or Americans?  BARON COHEN It depends on the class, actually. The best targets  0097 the legitimate targets  0097 are successful, powerful white men, who rule the country. And in Britain the upper class are incredibly accommodating. You can punch someone from the upper class in the face, and they'll go,  Oh, I'm dreadfully sorry.  They'll never ever throw you out of the room.  Here, there have been some occasions where people just are blunt, where they will say,  All right, enough is enough.  Marlin Fitzwater threw Ali G out of the room. And this year Andy Rooney hated Ali G from the moment he saw him. He starts asking:  Have you done this before? Is English your first language?  And then basically tries to stop the interview after one question.  HEFFERNAN Is Borat an anti-Semite?  BARON COHEN Yeah, yeah. Part of the idea of Borat is to get people to feel relaxed enough that they fully open up. And they say things that they never would on normal TV. So if they are anti-Semitic or racist or sexist, they'll say it.  HEFFERNAN And you asked someone,  Do you have slaves?   BARON COHEN Exactly. We were in a private gentlemen's club in Jackson, Miss. And all the serving staff were black. There's this unsaid racism; there's still segregation there. I can't remember the actual line, but I asked if he had slaves, and he said,  Slavery's over now.  And I go,  Yeah, that's right.  He goes,  It's good.  And I go,  Good for them!  He goes,  Yeah, good for them. Bad for us.   That guy normally would never say that he thought it's a shame that slavery doesn't exist anymore. But because he's in the room with somebody who's totally na 00efve and seems to not mind that slavery existed, he was fully honest.  HEFFERNAN So what have you learned about America that you didn't learn when you were in Atlanta working on your college thesis on civil rights?  BARON COHEN Some areas of America are scary. When I was doing Bruno at the Alabama-Mississippi football game, the moment I stood on the field the whole crowd started booing. And about half the crowd started yelling,  Faggot, faggot!  And spitting, and saying,  We're going to kill you.  It's a very weird sensation.  HEFFERNAN In general, though, Americans seem like very good sports in the interviews.  BARON COHEN I think the term  sports  is wrong because that implies that they are playing along and they realize they're part of the game. As far as I've seen, they're not.  HEFFERNAN But when you refer to weapons of mass destruction as  B.L.T.'s  in your interview with Pat Buchanan, he picks up on the term and just kind of goes with it. Surely he's in on the joke there.

According to the latest Hitwise stats (June  201806), hi5 is the 8th most visited US social network. However, the site is losing market share - it now accounts for 0.78% of the social networking market, down from 1.06% in May. And although not explicitly stated, Hi5 appears to be more targeted than MySpace - many of the site 2019s users are fans of HipHop and R&B.  Like most social networks, hi5 gives users a profile page which includes their name, gender, location and a profile picture. Users must be 13 or over, but obviously there 2019s no way to verify a member 2019s age. On sign up, the site strongly encourages users to import their friends from Hotmail, Yahoo! Mail and and AOL Mail - so strongly, in fact, that it 2019s hard to skip this process.  Profile pages are located at username.hi5.com. What 2019s more, these pages are fully customizable: you can can edit the color of the background, text and links, change the default font or add a background image. For more advanced customization, users can edit the html code - this would allow you to insert videos from YouTube and Google Video, images from Photobucket and slideshows from RockYou. However, this feature seems far less popular than on MySpace, and most of the pages still carry the default design.  Friends, Photos and Other Features  hi5 also features a  201cdegrees of separation 201d system similar to Friendster - your network consists of 1st, 2nd and 3rd degree friends, and you can decide whether to make your profile publicly viewable or only accessible to members of your network. You can add friends by sending a friend request or inviting people via email. In addition, you can rediscover old friends by adding your school in the  201cClassmates 201d section.  The hi5 feature set is fairly standard: you can add comments to profile pages, post items on the bulletin boards, add members to your favorites, join groups and send messages to other users. hi5 also has a very basic blogging tool under the  201cJournal 201d section, but it seems that this is rarely used.  One popular feature is photo hosting: users can create up to 100 albums, each containing a maximum of 250 photos. Also popular are the Flash-powered chatrooms, which are based around locations or interests. However, hi5 2019s most unique feature is the ability to award  201cFives 201d to other users. Fives are icons that describe a person 2019s personality or their relationship to you - examples include Best Friend, Better Half, Brother, Classmate, Nerd, Party Animal, Diva, Hero and Whiz Kid. If a user accepts a Five, it will appear on his or her profile page.  hi5 Music, which is currently in beta, is broadly similar to the hugely popular MySpace Music service. Bands create their own profile pages to promote their music and connect with fans. Each band page also includes a Flash player - users can play the tracks, add them to their own pages or, in some cases, buy them from the iTunes Music Store. Popular styles include HipHop, Reggaeton and R&B.  hi5 is a worthy rival to Facebook, Bebo, Multiply, Piczo, Tagworld and the rest. Nonetheless, MySpace continues to steal market share from all these networks. Summary: Attention hi5 Users!

If George Bush is elected President, I'm leaving for France,  said Robert Altman, the movie director who made  Nashville  and  M*A*S*H,  yesterday at the Deauville film fest (playing to the crowd in - you guessed it - France).   It would be a catastrophe for the whole world if George Bush is elected,  the aspiring expat said in his understated way.  He'd get no argument from Christie Brinkley.   I'm really scared of George W. - I mean really scared,  the venerable supermodel and Democratic Convention delegate told retired Gen. Colin Powell yesterday in New York. The two were talking at Redbook magazine's  Mothers and Shakers  luncheon at Lincoln Center.  [Bush] seems so gung-ho about looking like a big strong Republican.   Powell, who delivered the event's keynote address, defended the Republican candidate, telling Brinkley:  You don't have to be afraid of him.

A New Jersey accountant who pleaded no-contest to stalking and terrorizing the actress for 15 years has been sentenced to probation. Mark Ronald Bailey agreed on Tuesday to an L.A. Superior Court judge's order to stay away from Shields for the next 10 years - or face four years in prison.  Shields went to police after she received  letters containing lewd, nude photographs of Mr. Bailey and threatening letters to the tune of over 100 pieces of correspondence,  according to a prosecutor's statement. One of Bailey's letters referred to Shields as his  mail-order bride.  Bailey also allegedly tailed Shields from last October to January, authorities said.  He was arrested after deputies saw him pull a gun while he was staring at a reflection outside an L.A. office building. Officers found two cards addressed to Shields in Bailey's pockets. Each ended with the phrase,  I'm not afraid of you.   Bailey,42, was also ordered to get psychiatric counseling twice a week, take medication and report to a probation officer.  Shields, who once played a stalking victim in a TV movie, did not attend Tuesday's hearing but submitted a statement in which she said,  No one in our society should have to live in constant terror and fear.   Ra deal for Snipes staffer?   Art of War  star Wesley Snipes is learning the art of the lawsuit. An ex-staffer at Snipes' Amen Ra Films claims in L.A. Superior Court that she was fired because she couldn't work for six weeks after she suffered a miscarriage and underwent emergency surgery.  Former executive assistant Rosa Reeve claims that, in August 1999, her supervisor at Amen Ra initially said she could work at home while she recovered. But about a week later, Reeve says, she was told that she was needed in the office to help Snipes. She obliged, against her doctor's orders. Things got even worse the following week, according to her complaint, when she was told that she had to travel to the out-of-town set of a Snipes movie. Reeve charges that, when she said she couldn't handle all that physical activity, she was fired.  She's suing for breach of contract, employment discrimination and wrongful termination.

            "input": "text:Friday, September 26th 1997, 2:03AM  ARLINGTON, Va. Marv Albert answered each of the judge's questions in a somber, sullen affirmative.  Was he the same Marv Albert named in the indictment?  Was his age correctly specified? His educational background?  Was he pleased with the work his lawyers had done?   Yes,  he said.  Very much.   Finally, Judge Benjamin Kendrick asked,  Are you pleading guilty because you are in fact guilty of this crime?   Albert glanced back at the defense table, in particular lawyer Peter Greenspun. He was about to plead guilty to assault and battery, a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail and a $2,500 fine.   He looked very sad,  said Alem Tewolde, a spectator in the courtroom.  You could tell from his face.    Yes,  said Albert. His final affirmation made a mockery of the call that made him famous:  YESSS!   Any announcer would tell you their skills are not a matter of language, but of delivery. And Albert was as skillful as any. Spoken in exuberant declaration after a Knicks basket, YESSS! became the signature of Albert's celebrity. But now, on a much different court, spoken as little more than a mumble,  yes  was a declaration of ruination. It made him another player in the bizarre, grotesque roster of celebrity sinners.  People thought they knew Marv. It is often said that fans invited him into their homes. And why not? Marv Aufrichtig, as he was born, was the grocer's son from Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn. He was the kid who called imaginary games on an imaginary radio station, WMPA, in his basement. But no one could imagine the public man in his private life.  The prosecutor said the charges were based on Albert's  coarse and crude abuse of a human being, not what titillates the media.   But that's not really true. The titillation and the humiliation it caused was central to the case, the wedge with which the prosecutor pried his plea. Albert understood as well as anyone. He is, after all, a member of the media.  There was all sorts of testimony about Albert's sexual proclivities: threesomes and garter belts and biting. And there would have been a lot more dirt to dish if not for the laws of Virginia. Marv Albert's lawyers had plenty on his accuser. They just couldn't get much admitted into evidence.  Outside the courthouse, an old cab driver appeared. His name is Walter Brodie. He was Albert's regular driver in Washington. He said the victim tried to bribe him in return for false testimony against Albert. For 50 grand and a new car, he said, she asked him to tell prosecutors that Albert asked him to secure the services of a male prostitute.   She said, 'You're broke and I'm broke so you gotta do something for me,'   he said.  Someone asked if the woman said she had been sodomized.   She didn't say that,  said the cabby.  All the sodomy that was committed was volunteered on her side and on his side.   But the jury never got a chance to hear that. And the prosecutors never got a chance to challenge Brodie.   I just felt I had to end this ordeal for myself and my family,  Albert said.  And there they were, the Alberts, facing their own kind in the media encampment. The fiance, Heather Faulkiner, is a TV producer. The brothers are broadcasters, too. And so is Albert's son, Kenny. Albert's daughter, Denise, works for the show  Inside Edition.  It seemed as if the only one without a television resume was Max Aufrichtig, the grocer. Still, the short, gray-haired old man who had shuffled through the courthouse every day knew a thing or two about on-camera demeanor. He was like his kids and his grandkids. There were no cracks in his composure, not a moment of madness, nothing that might nourish the media.   Thank you very much,  said Marv.  All of you have been so wonderful to us.    But did you assault her?  came the cry.   I can't . . .  he said.  I can't answer that. . . .   The family and the lawyers and the private investigators began to walk the gauntlet, their tracks traced by the cameras and reporters. What a way for a career to end.  Albert thanked a sheriff's deputy, shaking his hand. Then he stood at the curb, alone in an ocean of people. The sun shone brightly as he waited for the silver Ford to take him back to that place where the public man becomes private, the place of his fantasies, where  yes  means YESSS! and  no  means nothing.

            "input": "text:'She has never been seen before,  said Giovanna Giusti, a curator at Florence's Uffizi gallery, as we stood in front of a haunting self-portrait from 1778.  The painting was of Maria Hadfield Cosway, a woman whose love affair with Thomas Jefferson was realised only through their exchange of letters. Cosway studied in Florence under Violante Beatrice Siries Cerroti, whose picture hangs at the entrance to Autoritratte (Self-portraits), a strange and moving group of historical self-portraits by women which make up the first part of Giusti's show.  As one of the artists selected for this show, I have spent the last week in Florence experiencing something I had never imagined  2013 one of my paintings being installed within the vast, extraordinary Uffizi; an event which would have been inconceivable when, as a 17-year-old art student, I made my first visit to the city.  In many ways, this visit to Florence couldn't be more in contrast to my first. In 1984, when I was a student at Glasgow School of Art and still full of romantic ideas, my trip was coloured by the knowledge that a serial killer, il Mostro, was on the loose. Like the young women of the city who were afraid to venture out at night, I obeyed a self-imposed curfew. But it didn't matter; as a teenager all I had wanted to do was follow the path of thousands of artists before me who had for centuries viewed Italy, and Florence in particular, as essential for the study of the history of art.  Last week, 20 years later, I witnessed the inner workings of the gallery and received extraordinary access to rarely seen paintings. The Uffizi, originally commissioned by Cosimo I in 1560 as government offices, now houses one the greatest collections of paintings in the world.  It is situated in the city where the concept of painting as a medium to describe the world around us was born, an idea we now take for granted. Leon Battista Alberti, the revered author, artist, poet, priest, linguist and philosopher of the Renaissance, wrote in 1436 that  A painting is a window looking on to the world . In contrast to Rome, Florence appears to present itself as an artistic expression of a particular period, peaking in the 14th and 15th centuries, a period when the Roman origin of its name,  Florentia  or  the flourishing , couldn't have been more apt.  I was first contacted more than a year ago by Antonio Natali, director of the Uffizi. He and Giusti, director of the department of contemporary art, explained that one of the gallery's strangest and most remarkable collections was of artists' self-portraits. It is unique in the number of works it contains (well over 1,000), their historical value (Cardinal Leopoldo de' Medici started it in the middle of the 17th century) and its quality. It has grown over the years, but has only occasionally been updated with contemporary artists.  Women artists are rare in the collection but some of the most famous, such as Lavinia Fontana and La Tintoretta, are present. Natali and Giusti want to address what they feel to be a lack of contemporary works in the collection and, in Autoritratte, a small number of self-portraits by contemporary women artists are being exhibited alongside historical works from the collection.  On seeing the show, one of the things that made sense to me was the linear quality of the whole exhibit, from La Tintoretta in the 16th century to the present day. I felt a connection, a relationship not unlike a conversation, was happening among the paintings. Work being made by artists now wouldn't have been possible without what had gone before and it was exciting to see that. What I hadn't expected when I walked around the room, was an odd sense of loss from the earlier portraits. These were women who had to fight for their place as artists in the world.  I was struck by the similarity of the poses. Almost all the women proudly displayed the tools of their trade, many with hands clutching paintbrushes thrust to the foreground. There is an exquisite, tiny portrait by Maria Catherine Hakewill Browne in which the androgyny of her depiction of herself is striking. Then there is Rosa Bonheur, who as a woman in 19th 2011century Paris needed a license to work in public and was required to wear men's clothing to do so.  Giusti had been aware of my lifelong fascination with Old Master painting and she was particularly interested in the more subtle representations of self contained in my work. Her invitation to me to undertake a commission set up a discussion between us on the nature of self-portraiture and what our expectations of it were. The need for artists to represent themselves has a weight of history behind it and Giusti's exhibition emphasises the continuation of that tradition, one which has particular resonance at the Uffizi. I feel honoured to be part of it.  The contemporary artists, including Vanessa Beecroft, Niki de Saint Phalle and Jenny Holzer, are at the centre of the show and, as I stood in front of my own work, which hangs between photographs by Francesca Woodman and Patti Smith, I realised I'd become part of a conversation. Woodman used her self-portraits to disconcerting and startling effect with the elements of self and object often merging. My painting has dispensed with any recognisable representation of self altogether: only the object is left, so the painting becomes about the idea of something.  When I was young, I wanted to immerse myself in this city: it was a way of paying homage to the masters of Italian painting. The difference between how I felt about Old Master painting then and how I feel now couldn't be more marked. I recently spent three years as associate artist at the National Gallery in London. It changed not only the way I look at paintings but also the way I think about painting. It's not uncommon to feel disconnected when viewing historical painting, particularly the Old Masters. We experience a false sense of familiarity with many of these great works because of the simple fact that we have greater access to them than those who went before. In losing their mystery, they appear to become diminished.  What I've realised is that these paintings don't reveal themselves all at once, if at all. We may never understand them. They are the product of someone else's mind. But the joy is in looking. Whether at the Venus of Urbino by Titian at the Uffizi or the intimate Fra Angelico frescos in each of the monastic cells of the city's Convent of San Marco, it is now almost impossible to imagine the impact these works of art would have had at the time they were made. These paintings, along with those by Masaccio, Giotto, Michelangelo and more, were the most groundbreaking works in the history of western art, and they were being viewed, in some cases, by people who had perhaps only seen two or three paintings in a lifetime. For the first time, the extraordinary complexity of the human condition was being portrayed in religious works of art.  Some key pieces of the Uffizi's collection are exhibited in the Vasari corridor, named after the brilliant architect of the building. It is over a kilometre long, extending from the Salone dei Cinquecento in the Palazzo Vecchio via the Uffizi to the Boboli Gardens at the Palazzo Pitti. It was built as a private covered passageway for the Medici family (and a useful way of spying on the local population).  I had the privilege of being given a private tour, made particularly fitting because Autoritratte marks the beginning of a project where the Uffizi intends to exhibit nearly twice as many self-portraits as are now hanging in the corridor. The aim is to be more representative of both Italian and foreign contemporary artists.  Giovanna Giusti is right to be proud. So many of the historical works from the collection have never been seen, and are known by the rather beautiful title I Mai Visti, a phrase Antonio Natali played with by changing it to mean  women who have never been seen . I too took immense pleasure as I watched the crowd gathering around that haunting little self-portrait by Maria Hadfield Cosway.

            "input": "text:However, another reason for all the OPERA-tic excitement was that back in 1985, physicists proposed that some high-energy neutrinos might really be tachyons, capable of interacting with an as-yet-known field, giving them just enough of an energy boost to break through the barrier. Such tachyon-like neutrinos would supersede photons as the fastest particles in the universe.  OPERA 2019s calibration error dashed those hopes, but there are still plenty of potential loopholes to be explored, such as the Star Trek-inspired warp drive mechanism first proposed by Mexican physicist Miguel Alcubierre in 1994. In general relativity, spacetime is dynamic, not static, warping and bending in response to the presence of mass or energy. Alcubierre suggested that it might be possible to encase a spaceship within a  201cwarp bubble 201d, whereby space contracted in front of the craft and expanded behind it, enabling it to travel faster than light. But within that bubble, spacetime would remain essentially flat and the craft would technically  201cobey 201d the cosmic speed limit.  Alas, once again we face an energy problem: achieving that degree of curvature would require enormous amounts of energy  2013 and negative energy at that  2013 equivalent to the mass of Jupiter. To propel a spacecraft across the Milky Way galaxy may require more energy than can be found in the mass of the entire universe. A more energy-efficient ring-shaped design for such a warp drive was described recently at a symposium on interstellar space flight, offering a meager shred of hope to diehard space acolytes that for future generations, warp drive will be a reality.  However, given what we know about general relativity and quantum field theory,  201cIt almost certainly can 2019t be done, 201d says Ken Olum, a cosmologist at Tufts.  201cOf course, if we are talking about quantum gravity, it 2019s hard to know, because we don 2019t really know what that is. 201d  Former Nasa scientist Kevin Grazier, who was the technical consultant for Battlestar Galactica, says that a version of the Alcubierre warp drive inspired the  201cjump drive 201d used in that series. It was based on the assumption that, in this fictional world, the Colonials had merged theories of electromagnetism and gravity, such that if you could create a very intense electromagnetic field, it would be functionally equivalent to an intense gravitational field capable of warping spacetime. Turning that ingenious fiction into a viable reality is another matter altogether.  If we really want to get speculative, Olum suggests FTL travel would be possible if exotic concepts, like those that emerge from superstring theory, prove to be correct.  We inhabit four-dimensional spacetime, but various permutations of superstring theory suggest our universe is just one of many, co-existing within a bubble of five-dimensional spacetime called the  201cbulk. 201d Within that bulk, our universe lines up in parallel with all the others, just like the pages in a book. Olum explains that, hypothetically, one could take a shortcut through the bulk, thereby arriving at your destination sooner than if you had travelled along your four-dimensional surface, or brane (short for membrane) as it is known.  Even then, there is a catch.  201cIn brane theories, only gravitons can travel through the bulk, 201d says Olum. So one would need to invent a machine that could scan an object and transmit the information in the form of gravitons to a second machine on the other end which would then reconstruct that object  2013 shades of teleportation, only with gravitons.  Considering we have yet to observe gravitons in our most powerful accelerators, and the current record for teleporting small clouds of atoms is the relatively non-Cylon-troubling distance of 143 kilometres (88 miles), this scenario must also remain firmly in the realm of science fiction, at least for now. Science advances, but it does so slowly, at a pace nowhere near the speed of light.

Photograph: Guy Bell  Frieze is a fearsome freak show, a Fomo funfair, a place where you see people you never see anywhere else. Unless, of course, you are one of those people, in which case you must bump into yourself wherever you go. Hello, glossy social x-ray of who-knows-what age with bouncy-castle lips and legs like a Giacometti! Hiya, irritable mid-20s man sporting bowtie, pleather bomber and cuban heels with spats! Lovely to see you, elderly chap in heavy-rimmed specs and too-dark wig, being led around by a pert young person of either gender! I wonder 2026  As ever at Frieze, it's hard to tear your eyes away from the humans and towards the art  2013 though it's slightly easier this year. The organisers of Frieze, Matthew Slotover and Amanda Sharp, have softened the experience for those here to admire the work rather than the worked-on. There's more space between the galleries, and there aren't so many of them. The lighting is less migraine-y, the flooring a muted grey. The food is mostly in one area.  Still, you do have to gird your loins and sharpen your elbows to do Frieze (as well as empty your wallet: a one-day ticket to Frieze and Frieze Masters is  00a350). Here we go 2026 First, it's off to the big stuff. Jeff Koons has a massive space at the Gagosian stand to show off his shiny, happy sculptures: a cat on a washing line, a lobster doing a handstand, a sweetie heart, a car tyre avec blow-up Tweety Pies. But no one dares go near the art because of the enormous, stern security men. Instead, we all stand back and take surreptitious photos on our phones. A little further in, at Lisson, there's a piece by revered US minimalist conceptualist Dan Graham: a big spiral see-through corridor. This is nice to look at, both from outside and within. You can legitimately stare at everyone passing as you become part of the art. At the other end of the show, newcomer Jennifer Rubell  2013 the daughter of two important collectors  2013 gives us her self-portrait. A huge pregnant woman lounges on her side, her head on her hand. Her belly is gone: you can curl up inside the space left, a living foetus. Hmmm. Not for me. Big doesn't mean significant.  Near the not-pregnant monolith, however, you find Frieze Projects  2013 the fair's site-specific commissions  2013 and this year they're all gathered in one place. This area has a more lo-fi feel than the rest of the fair; the materials for the spaces are brown paper, MDF, polystyrene blocks. Children are encouraged to come in, and indeed form a vital part of a few of the commissions. For The Committee, Pilvi Takala asked a group of kids aged 8-12 from the Eastside youth centre in Bow, east London to decide what art to create with her award of  00a37,000. You can see the children talking about the project here. They are great.  Nearby, Angelo Plessas has created a playground where kids can create faces, play with art-creating computer games and enjoy performances. Round the corner there's Ken Okiishi's robot paint-shooter, which fires paint at glass in front of you: proper fun. Rivane Neuenschwander offers three enormous Battleship games; workers diligently scrape off five layers of material from each square to see if there's an X underneath. And Lili Reynaud-Dewar sits on a bed, reading Guillaume Dustan and Marguerite Duras out loud, as the bed coughs up black oil. Scary, sleazy, intimate.  This being Frieze week, there are plenty of other  2013 free  2013 art shows to check out, such as the first major solo exhibition of Oscar Murillo at the South London Gallery. Murillo,27, a Colombian who moved to the UK when he was 10, is the hot ticket in town. Two years ago he was working as a cleaner; now he is touted as the new Basquiat. Prices for his works at Frieze are in the hundreds of thousands, but at the SLG he was offering hand-painted lottery tickets for  00a32,500 each (yes, I know, but they're cheap compared to the rest of his work). Those of us without two grand to spare can just enjoy the excellent show, essentially Murillo's Dalston studio transplanted into Camberwell, with works that are finished, works that are not, all free to be bashed about by us visitors as we wish.  At the Delfina Foundation, near Victoria, you can see the result of one of last year's Frieze commissions: Asli Cavusoglu's three-part film, Murder in Three Acts. A witty piece that merges CSI cliches with art world norms, it was created in two booths at last year's fair.  At the ICA, cult female US artist artist Lutz Bacher has a disturbing installation downstairs, a quite uplifting one above: sound, film and sculpture mixed with found objects of Americana. Excellent. And at the Zabludowicz Collection on Chalk Farm Road, I loved Andy Holden's MI!MS project: where he revisits a manifesto for art that he and his friends set out when they were 18 and living in Bedford. Maximum Irony, Maximum Sincerity is the title of that manifesto: the results  2013 a clutter of films, ephemera, installations, happenings  2013 are funny (because of the irony) and unexpectedly moving (that'll be the sincerity).

Gone is the brooding, leading-man stare that made its way into  201cWater for Elephants 201d and gave star power to David Cronenberg 2019s adaptation of Don DeLillo 2019s bleak  201cCosmopolis. 201d  In  201cThe Rover, 201d the post-apocalyptic tale of a man (Guy Pearce) on a desperate search for his car in the desolate Australian outback, Pattinson plays a troubled sidekick  2014 a slow-thinking man with a Southern drawl, rotting teeth, and a violent streak.  The role, which adds moments of strange comic relief to the film, won Pattinson big accolades at the Cannes Film Festival. The actor, 28 and almost two years past  201cThe Twilight Saga, 201d called the Globe to talk about  201cThe Rover 201d hours before it had its Los Angeles premiere.  Q. I spent the day reading reviews of you in this movie. They use phrases like  201cinarguable skill. 201d  Q. Do you read reviews?  A. Oh, yeah, definitely, but I only remember the bad ones.  Q. Have you always read reviews? Even during the  201cTwilight 201d years?  A. I never learn my lesson. I was sitting around earlier reading them and everyone 2019s like,  201cStop it. You 2019ve got to keep doing press all day. 201d  Q. You must be loving all these  201cRover 201d reviews. People keep using the word  201ctransformative. 201d  A. It 2019s really the best I could have hoped to have happened. I 2019d already come to terms with it being completely not received well and everyone hating it, so everything is a bonus.  Q. How did you wind up in this film? I read an interview with your director [Mich 00f4d] where he talked about having a meeting with you. I was wondering which one of you was wooing the other.  A. I met him before the script was even around. I loved  201cAnimal Kingdom 201d so much. I like quite aggressive filmmaking. He seems very ambitious, which is very different. When this script came around, it was one of the top five scripts I 2019ve ever read since I started acting.  Q. At what point was it decided that you were going to do a deep Southern accent in this film?  Robert Pattinson (right) teams up with Guy Pearce in  201cThe Rover, 201d a post-apocalyptic film set in the Australian outback.  A. It said in the tiny description of the character that he was from the South, and that was basically the only thing it said about the character. Actually, Southern accents are quite fun to do anyway; you want to start saying the lines out loud. Generally, you want to start being analytical about a part, and with this, it was just immediately  2014 you want to perform it.  Q. The accent seemed effortless.  A. For some reason, with regional and American accents, my ear 2019s quite good, it 2019s quite attuned to it. I can do regional American a lot better than I can do regional English. I don 2019t know why. I think just growing up on American movies  2014 and from singing as well. I grew up listening to a lot of blues and stuff. It 2019s that kind of cadence.  Q. I want to talk about the wardrobe in this film  2013 and the teeth. You looked believably filthy.  A. It 2019s massive to me, all the costumes and everything, especially shoes and stuff. However generic the wardrobe looks, like the jeans, we 2019d gone through hundreds of pairs of five-dollar jeans to find the right ones.  Q. Were you allowed to shower during this filming process?  A. Yeah, it doesn 2019t make any difference. The second you wake up in the morning, you 2019re already pouring sweat. [ 201cThe Rover 201d was shot in Australia.] It 2019s kind of nice because you don 2019t need to have the makeup touch-up every two seconds. You 2019re just covered in blood and grime.   201cThis [ 201cRover 201d look] is nice because you can sit around in a big pile of mud and just enjoy yourself, 201d said Pattinson.  Q. I wondered which was more difficult  2014 to be in this kind of costume or to be in  201cCosmopolis, 201d where you have to look perfect throughout the film.  A. I guess both of them. I remember waking up [during the shooting of]  201cCosmopolis, 201d and my hair was stuck in the shape constantly. This [ 201cRover 201d look] is nice because you can sit around in a big pile of mud and just enjoy yourself.  Q. Speaking of  201cCosmopolis, 201d David Cronenberg is being honored at the Provincetown Film Festival this weekend. You 2019ve now worked with him twice, in  201cCosmopolis 201d and  201cMaps to the Stars. 201d If I get to interview him, what should I ask?  A. I would try to find the most random question about African politics or something and he 2019ll stun you with his encyclopedic knowledge of it. Or about 15th-century Czechoslovakian philosophy. He 2019ll be like,  201cOh, as a matter of fact . . .  201d  Q. According to the Internet, you 2019re in the running to play Indiana Jones. Is that just a Hollywood rumor or the real thing?  A. No, I think this story 2019s just made up. It 2019s like a, what is it called, a reverse psychology sound board where they say,  201cOh, let 2019s write an article about how excited we are about him being cast as Indiana Jones and then everyone will say how much they hate him and how terrible an idea it is. 201d  Q. You have your big  201cRover 201d premiere tonight. Will your  201cTwilight 201d fans still camp out to see you?  A. They 2019ve always been pretty supportive in every movie I 2019ve done; they 2019ve always created websites for the movie and stuff. I think everyone I work with is so stunned because they 2019re very proactive. That 2019s kind of great and always kind of shocking. Yeah, I 2019m curious about how people are going to interpret this one.  Q. You talk about liking ambitious directors. What 2019s the next ambitious move for you?  A. I just keep getting really lucky. I 2019m doing [ 201cIdol 2019s Eye 201d] in October with [French director] Olivier Assayas and Robert De Niro, which is kind of a ridiculous thing. I met Olivier two years ago and he talked about this script. It 2019s crazy and I 2019m so excited about doing it. Things just seem to keep dropping in my lap at the perfect moment.  Q. Do you get any chance to read books  2014 or is it all scripts now?  A. I just read the Andre Agassi autobiography, which I thought was amazing. I thought it was so great. I read this book by Steven Pinker called  201cHow the Mind Works, 201d which is also one of the best books I 2019ve read in ages. It 2019s about evolutionary psychology. I didn 2019t understand any of it [laughing].  Q. I should ask what you 2019re wearing to the premiere tonight. Isn 2019t that what I 2019m supposed to ask?  A. Really, I 2019m actually staring right at it right now because I had to get it refitted because I 2019m a fatass at the moment. I think it 2019s Alexander McQueen.

            "input": "text:Updated SEP 14, 2014 9:20a ET  Floyd Mayweather worked far too hard against Marcos Maidana their last time out to have to do it again in the rematch Saturday night.  Mayweather dominated Maidana from the opening bell, using his boxing skills to keep the Argentine off balance and pile up points on his way to a unanimous 12-round decision to retain his welterweight and super welterweight titles before a crowd at the MGM Grand that sometimes booed the lack of action.  It almost came at a cost, though, in a bizarre scene in the eighth round when Mayweather claimed that Maidana bit him on his wrist while they were in a clinch near the center of the ring.   He bit me!  Mayweather yelled to the Showtime announcers working ringside.  Mayweather remained unbeaten in his remarkable 18-year pro career, winning for the 47th time and doing it with such dominance that about the only one complaining about the decision was Maidana.   I was pressuring him and I was the aggressor,  Maidana said.  I won the fight.   Mayweather earned at least $32 million for the rematch, bringing his total purses to more than $100 million in the last year. Though he wasn't marked up, he was upset over the bite.   We were tangled in the center of the ring and I didn't realize what it was. Then I saw that he bit me,  Mayweather said.  After the eighth round my fingers were numb, I couldn't use my left hand.   Maidana denied he bit Mayweather.   How can he say I bit the glove with my mouthpiece?  Maidana asked.  I'm not a dog.   The fight was a marked contrast to their first bout in May, when Maidana roughed Mayweather up in a close fight. Mayweather won that bout, but it was close enough for Mayweather to offer an opponent only the second rematch of his career.  Maidana won't get a third fight after failing to land any big punches.  Two ringside judges scored it 116-111 for Mayweather, while the third had it 115-112. The Associated Press had it 117-110.  *By clicking  SUBSCRIBE , you have read and agreed to the Fox Sports Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.   I felt sharper in the first fight, my rhythm was off,  Mayweather said.  I got hit with some shots tonight I shouldn't have gotten hit with. But that comes with the sport.   Mayweather complained long after the first fight that Maidana was a dirty fighter, and complained even more when Maidana seemed to try to hit him below the belt in a clinch in the eighth round, then apparently tried to bite him.  Mayweather immediately jumped back and gestured to referee Kenny Bayless that Maidana bit him on the wrist. He went to his corner and showed Bayless where the bite was, then went over to the Showtime announcers table to complain.  Maidana would later be penalized a point for tackling Mayweather as he tried desperately to find something that would work.  By the end of the ninth round, Maidana was so out of sorts he went to the wrong corner when the bell rang.  Maidana spent many of the early rounds trying to figure out a way to get inside like he did in May. Mayweather kept him at a distance, circling around and landing left jabs and hooks, then scampering out of the way before Maidana could respond.  Punch stats showed Maidana throwing far more punches (572-326) while Mayweather landed more (166-128). Mayweather's was hit with only 22 percent of punches while landing 51 percent of his own.   I do have some bumps and bruises,  Mayweather said.  But I listened to my dad (trainer Floyd Mayweather Sr.) who always said hit and not get hit. That's the way you last in this sport.   Mayweather was a 6-1 favorite in the fight, even though Maidana gave him a tough time in their first bout. He showed why in the early rounds as he moved and boxed while Maidana chased him futilely around the ring.  Mayweather was determined not to let the fight become anything like the first, when Maidana went after him wildly and mauled him at every opportunity. For the second fight, Mayweather came out boxing and did so beautifully during the opening rounds.  Maidana was more cautious early than he was in the first fight, willing to take his time to find Mayweather. He finally began to pick up the pace in the fourth round, trapping Mayweather on the ropes and landing some shots to his body and head.  Mayweather, though, showed he learned his lessons from the first fight, when he was cut over his right eye and took a lot of shots to the top of his head. A defensive wizard, he fought moving sideways and backward, throwing his left jab out and slipping the big punches thrown by the Argentine challenger. Summary: Floyd Mayweather Jr. refused to allow Marcos Maidana to turn their rematch into a brawl, boxing masterfully to win a 12-round unanimous decision Saturday night in their welterweight title fight.",

            "input": "text:FORTUNE  2014 For the past few years, economists have been waiting for the housing market to rebound so the job market can finally  2014 crash? Wait, no. It 2019s the opposite. Right?  On Friday, we 2019ll get the latest look at how the job market is doing. Hiring is improving, but the unemployment rate has stayed stubbornly high. The go-to explanation among economists has been the weak housing market. Where are all those construction workers going to find work? Nursing? (That 2019s actually a pretty good idea.)  Housing prices are jumping again, and some people are even saying there 2019s a new bubble. We 2019ve pointed out you shouldn 2019t expect the economy to come roaring back just because the housing market is. But two economists are taking an even more extreme stance: that a good real estate market, where more people buy houses instead of rent, will throw more people out of work.  MORE: A housing era loan makes a comeback, with a twist  The paper by David Blanchflower of Dartmouth and Andrew Oswald of the University of Warwick titled  201cDoes High Home-ownership Impair the Labor Market? 201d, has been out for a month or so but was only published by the National Bureau of Economic Research on Monday. Among the findings:  That makes the study interesting for another reason. Not only are the authors saying the conventional wisdom of a weak housing market and a weak job market improving in tandem is wrong. But also the reason we say such things.  Most people believe the reason high homeownership in a housing bust creates stubbornly high unemployment is because the out of work can 2019t afford to sell their houses  2014 they owe too much  2014 and move to an area of the country where their job prospects are better.  But Blanchflower and Oswald insist it 2019s not the homeowners who are the unemployed, or at least the overwhelming majority of them. So the  201ctrapped in a house 201d storyline doesn 2019t work for them. Instead, they say homeownership creates a sort of economic rigidity that hurts the job market for everyone, but they don 2019t say how.  Homeownership, though, was rising throughout the 2000s, and yet the unemployment rate dipped below 4% in the middle part of the decade. Would it have gone lower? It 2019s only recently that homeownership seems to be holding us back.  Another funny thing about the study is that one of the first economists that Blanchflower and Oswald thank in the beginning of their paper is Dean Baker, co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research and a prominent liberal economist. It 2019s odd because Baker disagrees with Blanchflower and Oswald, which he says he told the two authors before they published the paper.  MORE: This country needs another financial crisis  Blanchflower and Oswald touch on two prominent recent economic debates. First of all, whether we should be promoting and subsidizing homeownership. On that, Baker agrees with the authors that subsidies that push many people into houses, and the lax lending that comes with them, are a bad idea.  The second debate is the structural vs. cyclical debate about the job market. On that, they 2019re split. Baker believes that we are in a cyclical downturn and more stimulus will help the job market. The authors, however, seem to be siding with people who think there have been other things going on with the economy, like a rise in homeownership, that will make it very tough for the unemployment rate to fall.  Baker 2019s own research suggests the housing bust has had little effect on worker mobility, and, in general, is hard to pin down as the real reason for high unemployment, other than in construction or other jobs directly related to housing. People still move for new job opportunities. They just leave with less.  To be fair to the authors, they don 2019t say that a jump in home buying will immediately lead to a rise in unemployment. The effect develops with a lag. But the lag is also the problem with the paper.  In places were the economy is weak, renters tend to flee because it is easiest for them to do so, leaving high rates of homeownership behind. In areas were the economy is strong, workers show up, and many don 2019t immediately buy a house. That could explain why Blanchflower and Oswald get the results they do. Michigan, for example, shows up as a high homeownership state and a high unemployment state, and the two don 2019t necessarily go hand in hand. Summary: A new study points to higher homeownership as the reason the unemployed aren't finding work.",

The $157 billion company got its start selling books online, happy to lose money while driving prices down, waiting for its brick-and-mortar competitors, with their thin margins and high overhead, to starve.

Today reports revealed Amazon hired Kim Swift, a designer of Portal, and Clint Hocking, a designer of Far Cry 2. Amazon Game Studios 2019 first release is a game called Sev Zero, a third-person shooter game with the ability to go multiplayer. It looks and plays like the hardcore games from EA or Sega.  But in typical Amazon style, Sev Zero is a steal. The game only costs $6.99, and users who purchase the Fire game controller get it for free. Beyond that, the average price of paid games on Fire TV is just $1.85.

It 2019s not clear if Amazon would convince those studios to include their games on Fire TV. Hardcore gamers will remain loyal to their systems and titles. But with Sev Zero and the host of low-cost games on Fire TV, Amazon is making a statement: The price of games will come down.  Compared with any other piece of digital media, from music, movies, and TV to news and books, games haven 2019t taken a price hit with the shift to digital.

            "input": "text:For 40 years, Los Angeles 2019 building code has required all buildings 75 feet and taller to have a rooftop emergency helicopter landing facility in a location approved by the fire chief. The idea in 1974, when the law was passed, was to make skyscrapers safer, in part as a reaction to a catastrophic fire in Brazil. But we know now there are better ways to make structures like the landmark U.S. Bank tower safe. I, for one, am cheering for the recently announced end of a policy requiring flat-topped buildings in Los Angeles. It 2019s a policy that holds lessons for tall buildings everywhere.  As an urban planner and architect (before becoming a professor, I was an architect at SOM-Chicago, the former Skidmore, Owings & Merrill), I know safety is more critical in tall buildings than in low-rise structures because tall buildings host a greater number of inhabitants and are themselves expensive investments. I also know that, if appropriately designed and built, skyscrapers are safer in many respects than low-rise and mid-rise buildings. They have concrete cores that are designed to withstand the extreme lateral forces and loads that occur during high winds and earthquakes. Fire safety systems in skyscrapers include sprinklers and wet and dry standpipes, to which firefighting hoses can be connected.  Codes for tall building safety were found to be deficient following the World Trade Center collapse in 2001. The National Institute of Standards and Technology concluded it would have taken more than three hours to evacuate the buildings if they had been full of people at the time of the attacks. In the process,14,000 people  2013 28% of the occupants  2013 would have died because of insufficient stairwell capacity.  NIST stressed that time is of the essence in evacuation. And helipads have a very small impact on evacuation times. Helicopters take time to land, load people, and take off. They only take a small number of a skyscraper 2019s occupants each time. Research indicated that if the World Trade Center rooftops had been accessible (the helipad fell in disuse), helicopters couldn 2019t have landed because of the heat and smoke.  Our rarely used helipads may enhance the perception of safety but do little else. The NIST study called for a smarter strategy of using building design for safety. Among the key elements:  Assume that the full building will evacuate. Conventionally, builders of high-rises have assumed  201cstaged evacuations 201d will occur. During a fire on one floor, occupants were supposed to evacuate to adjacent floors until it was safe to return. After the World Trade Center collapse, it became clear a tall building 2019s occupants would likely want to evacuate all at once in an emergency situation. NIST recommends that all non-residential skyscrapers that exceed 420 feet in height have three stairwells and fireproofing capable of withstanding a pressure of 1,000 pounds per square foot (in the event of a bomb, gas breakout, or something similar).  Allow some office workers to use elevators in an emergency. Conventionally, in an emergency situation, elevators in high-rise buildings are used by firefighters only. NIST recommends building elevators that can withstand fires and structural damage in the concrete core of a building.  Mark stairwells and exits with glow-in-the-dark signs. As simple as it sounds, not every building has such markings, especially those built before the 2000s. New York was the first large city to require luminous markings in stairwells, five years after the 9 11 tragic events. More than 1,500 buildings now have the markings, but that 2019s still a small fraction of America 2019s tall buildings.  If a city adopts these recommendations  2013 and also asks tall buildings to include refuge floors, video-camera surveillance, and automatic sprinkler systems  2014 the safety of the skyscrapers will increase significantly.  Relaxing the requirements of a helipad also will empower architects to create more interesting rooftops. A space 50-by-50-feet wide at minimum is required for a helipad spot, plus a typical additional 25 feet around it as a buffer. This has resulted in a repetitive, boxy roof shape in the Los Angeles skyline.  Beyond aesthetics, boxy rooftops with helipads are really a missed opportunity to create  201cgreen 201d roofs with sustainable features. Now Los Angeles can do something like the spiral form in the rooftop of Shanghai Tower in Shanghai that captures rainwater. Some towers 2019 tops are now designated for wind turbines to harness wind energy, such as the Strata Tower in London.  There 2019s nothing to fear  2013 and much to gain  2013 in relaxing the helipad requirement. I, for one, will be watching to see what inventive skyscrapers Angelinos come up with.

            "input": "text:FORTUNE  2014 Gyft CEO and Co-Founder Vinny Lingham has one goal: eliminate the plastic gift card.  That idea animates San Francisco-based startup Gyft, an app that offers users the ability to buy and then give gift cards directly on their smartphones. Users can purchase gift cards from close to 150 vendors  2014 including Amazon AMZN , Nike NKE and Old Navy GPS  2014 and send them to any other user of the app. Having the card balance available on your phone, so goes the theory, is more convenient than physical cards.  Backed by Google Ventures GOOG , Gyft offers a few additional features to those who have already purchased plastic gift cards. Users can upload the balance of an existing gift card directly to their account, or even re-gift a card to one of their contacts.  201cWe want Gyft to be the digital wallet that everyone has on their phone for receiving gift cards, 201d says Lingham. In the company 2019s first month, users uploaded more than $1 million in existing gift cards to the app.  Gyft hit the scene just in time for the holiday season, amassing more than 50,000 downloads in the company 2019s first 90 days, an important footnote considering the money at stake. A recent study by the National Retail Federation found that 81% of holiday shoppers plan to purchase gift cards this year. Total spending is predicted to reach more than $28.5 billion, and depending on the vendor, Gyft receives between 10% and 15% of the value of each gift card sold through its app.  MORE: Marc Andreessen: We 2019re in a tech depression  But spending isn 2019t the gift card industry 2019s problem  2014 unused gift cards leave billions of dollars on the table every year. Research from Visa found that 40% of gift card owners fail to redeem the card 2019s full value, leaving more than $2 billion in gift cards unused in 2011.  201cIt is clear that there is a tremendous amount of value trapped in stored value cards or gift cards, 201d says Joe Kraus, a general partner at Google Ventures.  201c[Gift cards are] so much more convenient by mirroring them into the device we carry with ourselves all the time. 201d Retailers aren 2019t the beneficiaries of this wasted cash, however. Federal regulations prohibit companies from listing gift card sales as revenue until the cards are redeemed, meaning both retailers and gift card owners want to eliminate the waste.  Gyft hopes to help by taking a narrow approach to solving a major problem. Gyft, unlike other gift-giving companies such as Giftly or Facebook 2019s FB Karma, deals exclusively with gift cards, minimizing its reach in the overall online shopping arena. But Lingham, alongside co-founders CJ MacDonald and Mark Levitt, wanted to avoid expanding too quickly. Gyft is Lingham 2019s third startup: in 2003, he co-founded Clicks2Customers, a search marketing company, and in 2007, Yola.com, a website builder. This time around, he decided to keep things simple.  201cOne of the pitfalls of very creative people, particularly entrepreneurs, is you tend to see too far into the future, 201d says Lingham,33, who grew up in South Africa.  201cThe inherent nature that makes you what you are is also your biggest enemy. 201d  Lingham credits Apple AAPL for unintentionally helping ease Gyft 2019s product into the market. When Apple previewed its new iOS6 operating system in June, Passbook was highlighted as the iPhone 2019s new digital wallet feature. If retailers wanted to keep up with an influx of iPhone users trying to use coupons, loyalty cards or tickets straight from their phone, retail technology would need to be ready. Gyft, launched three months later, no longer needed to convince retailers to accept payments via smartphone.  201cApple saved us in a big way, 201d says Lingham.  201cThey saved us from having to educate the public on why this was a good solution. 201d With Gyft, gift cards can be integrated with Passbook if users wish to see all of their digital wallet items in one place.

Given Gyft 2019s connection to Google Ventures, Google Wallet would be a logical suitor, although Kraus would not comment. Square Wallet, another mobile wallet offering, announced earlier this week that gift cards will now be part of its package. The announcement validates Lingham 2019s business idea but demonstrates how crowded the space is.  While the app was previously exclusive to iPhone, Gyft launched its Android application this week and hopes to provide users with a desktop platform beginning early next year. (Non-iPhone users can still use Gyft through a mobile browser.) In the future, Lingham envisions the app will provide retailers with the opportunity to reward customers by giving them gifts or unique coupons through push notifications. As companies continue to fight for customer attention when it comes to digital payments, Gyft hopes to carve out a place among the giants  2014 one plastic gift card at a time.

You are looking for shoes to complete the look, or want to read product reviews, or maybe just summon an associate to bring you an item in a different color or size, rather than have to get decent again and go back out to the store floor (if you even decide not to leave).  At two Nordstrom locations, one in Seattle, the other in San Jos 00e9, the upscale retailer is about to provide customers with technology by eBay EBAY to do just that: next week, in select departments at those stores, Nordstrom will begin to test full-length mirrors that, with the tap of a customer 2019s finger, turn into interactive screens, effectively creating smart fitting rooms.  The idea is to bring tech to an untapped part of a store where many customers ultimately make their purchasing decisions: the fitting room.   201cThe way customers shop for clothes has evolved, 201d Jamie Nordstrom, the retailer 2019s head of stores and former leader of its Nordstrom Direct digital business, told Fortune.  201cHow do we take all the information that 2019s available to customers while they 2019re sitting on the couch at home browsing and add that to the dressing rooms, so it 2019s the best of both worlds? 201d  Getting the best of both worlds is the holy grail for retailers eager to take full advantage of their physical stores in this e-commerce era. Nordstrom, widely considered a technology leader among brick and mortar retailers, plans between this year and 2018 to have spent $1.2 billion on tech, including e-commerce, fulfillment centers, and in-store service enhancements, such as these connected fitting rooms. Last quarter, comparable sales at its department stores were unchanged, showing how important it is to keep pushing to get more out of each shopper 2019s visit to the stores.  And Nordstrom is not alone in looking for what 2019s next in retail tech. Bloomingdale 2019s, the upscale chain owned by Macy 2019s Inc M , recently began trying out smart fitting rooms, equipped with wall-mounted iPads rather than Nordstrom 2019s interactive mirrors, at five of its stores.   201cYou have shoppers used to having all that content and help in the palm of their hand, 201d said Wendy Liebmann, CEO of WSL Strategic Retail.  201cHere, you have a literally captive audience, so there 2019s the opportunity. 201d  While Nordstrom 2019s smart fitting rooms build on what eBay also recently developed for fashion designer Rebecca Minkoff 2018s two boutiques, it is a more complicated project given how much bigger Nordstrom department stores are and how much more inventory they hold. And so in that regard, this test will be more telling of how the smart fitting rooms can be adopted by retailers broadly. Nordstrom won 2019t say how much of a roll-out it is planning 2014the success of these tests will determine that.  Mirror, mirror on the wall-should I buy this?  In the Nordstrom smart fitting rooms, shoppers will be able to enter with items selected on the sales floor, along with suggestions from the associate. They will also be equipped with barcode scanning to identify what is in the store so if a customer needs an item in another size or color, she can see for herself if it is in stock and instruct the associate to bring it.  For eBay, the technology is yet another step forward in the capabilities it built for Minkoff, and before that for Kate Spade KATE , for which the tech giant created an interactive storefront at four Manhattan stores that allowed customers standing on the street to pick merchandise, and place an order. The Minkoff stores have the ability to remember what a customer tried on during a previous visit, a capability Nordstrom won 2019t have right out of the gate.  While one might think such a state-of-the-art technology and how it facilitates high-touch customer service would more suitable to upscale stores, eBay thinks the technology could work even in more value-oriented retail chains. It could takethe shape of a big screen on a wall on the sales floor, rather than a sleek mirror in a changing room. Indeed, Jamie Nordstrom said the tech could potentially work at the off-price Nordstrom Rack stores, though there are no firm plans for a pilot there.  The partnership with Nordstrom is also a way for eBay, best known by consumers for its marketplaces and PayPal payments service, to burnish its reputation as a retail tech innovator, including in physical stores, where more than 90% of sales still take place. Another new eBay initiative is the connected mall it has developed with Simon Property Group, SPG consisting of an interactive mall directory that among other things, highlights events and deals happening that day. Growth in tech services will also help as the company gets ready for life after the upcoming spin-off of PayPal in 2015.   201cThis is about us saying,  2018Hey, are we really just an e-commerce company, or are we really a partner to anyone who does commerce, 201d said Steve Yankovich, vice president of innovation and new ventures at eBay.

            "input": "text:The actor Shia LaBeouf has told of being raped while performing his work #IAMSORRY at a Los Angeles art gallery. Was this a case of performance art creating an atmosphere in which anything, including crime, can happen?  Ever since the first ancestral performance happenings in the early 20th century, this dynamic and unpredictable form of art has been associated with violence and danger. From riotous Futurist evenings and the chaos of notorious avant-garde premieres such as that of The Rite of Spring in Paris in 1913, to surrealists insulting priests on the street, the moment when art becomes a kind of drama has often been a moment of physical threat.  LaBeouf 2019s performance #IAMSORRY is reminiscent of a more recent tradition of performance art that started in the early 1970s and replaces the sadism of the surrealists with a masochism in which the performer is a victim. In 1971, Chris Burden got himself shot in the arm in the name of art. He was also crucified on the back of a Volkswagen. Marina Abramovi 0107 nearly died in a performance in which she was trapped in a burning, petrol-drenched star. Vito Acconci assumed the humiliating role of masturbating under the floor of an art gallery as he fantasised about the visitors above him.  Was a female visitor 2019s apparent assault on LaBeouf a grotesque misinterpretation of the myths of self-exposure and suffering that surround performance art?  Regardless of that incident, #IAMSORRY stinks of bad art. It shows how hard it is to create good work in this strange and difficult genre. To work, a performance must create a genuinely special and intense atmosphere of intimacy and risk. LaBeouf 2019s show, in collaboration with artists Luke Turner and Nastja S 00e4de R 00f6nkk 00f6 sounds, to be honest, like a third-rate imitation of the works of Abramovi 0107 or Yoko Ono, whose Cut Piece dramatises vulnerability perhaps more powerfully than any other. People queued to encounter LaBeouf in a gallery. Er, hasn 2019t that been done? This piece is highly reminiscent of Abramovi 0107 2019s event The Artist Is Present, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.  Like Abramovi 0107, the actor sat behind a desk waiting for visitors to interact with him. The difference was that he had a bag over his head bearing the words  201cI am not famous any more. 201d  It is the charisma and mystique of an Abramovi 0107 that enables her to make such a performance powerful rather than pointless. LaBeouf 2019s exhibit sounds more like the kind of poorly conceived and basically silly event that gets performance art a bad name. Real artists rarely wear bags on their heads.  Clearly this does not excuse rape.  Yet it does put into perspective the romantic myth of  201csuffering for art 201d. People suffer for art all the time. Unfortunately, the art is rarely worth it. Pain alone does not make you an artist. Summary: Performance art is a difficult genre that often exploits physical threat, but LaBeouf 2019s #IAMSORRY is simply bad",

I think Jerusalem can be and should be the capital of two states,  Mogherini told reporters in the Israeli-occupied West Bank city of Ramallah, touching on a sensitive issue that has blocked peace efforts for decades.  Her appeal, at a joint news conference with Palestinian prime minister Rami Hamdallah, came hours after the killing of an Arab-Israeli by police fanned tensions between Israel and the Palestinians.  The shooting in northern Israel came after another night of clashes in east Jerusalem between youths hurling stones and firecrackers at police, who retaliated with rubber bullets, stun grenades and tear gas.  The violence has spiked as Israel has pushed ahead with its policy to build Jewish settlements on lands the Palestinians want for a future state and against the background of efforts by Jewish extremists to secure rights to pray at Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque.   Jerusalem is not just a beautiful city, the challenge is to show that Jerusalem can be shared in peace and respect,  Mogherini said.   The message is not for the people who live here, the message is to the rest of the world,  she said.   It is not a Palestinian-Israeli situation, it is a global issue.   On Friday, Mogherini met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who dismissed her criticism of Israeli settlement building in annexed east Jerusalem and the West Bank.

We spent two days traveling around in a caravan of black and white SUVs visiting humanitarian projects where NRG NRG and Crane are involved. Later we all got an email from a member of the group, Bechtel CFO Mike Adams, listing concrete ways we could help at one of the schools we saw: $14,000 for toilets; $4,000 so kids can wash their hands before they eat; $3,500 to construct a rainwater collection facility. Adams, the Crane family, and Christina Weiss Lurie, co-owner of the Philadelphia Eagles, came up with $25,000 to outfit the kitchen and pay for the high fence that surrounds the school.

Because the sun was unbearable, the ceremony took place outside the kindergarten building beneath a metal canopy that serves two purposes: shade below, solar-panel mounting structure above. The 17-killowatt system NRG installed at Union Des Apotres generates more than enough power to run the school. A battery back-up system stores enough overflow to keep things running at least 36 hours without sunlight.

The project, expected to be completed in 2017, is a belated culmination of the 1996 merger of Boston City Hospital and University Hospital, which created Boston Medical. While the hospitals have integrated departments over the past 18 years, and closed one of the two emergency rooms in 2010, they have continued to offer medical care at both campuses, often shuttling patients admitted at one to specialists at the other  2014 a two-block ambulance ride.  That would end under the consolidationplan. It has been approved by Boston Medical 2019s directors and the Boston Redevelopment Authority but awaits a  201cdetermination of need 201d certificate from the state Department of Public Health.   201cWe 2019re positioning ourselves for the next phase of health care, 201d said Dr. Ravin Davidoff, chief medical officer at Boston Medical.  201cWe 2019re creating a patient-centered clinical campus. 201d  The plan calls for eight additional operating rooms and about 70 single rooms on the former Boston City Hospital site, expanding outpatient facilities and the gastroenterology department, and creating an updated, consistent feel throughout a sprawling campus dotted with aging buildings. It would also expand by a third Boston Medical 2019s congested emergency department, the busiest in Massachusetts with nearly 130,000 patient visits last year.  But it will also mean closing the Newton Pavilion on the former University Hospital campus. Those two adjoining buildings will be sold.  Proceeds from the sale, along with money raised through philanthropy and bond financing, will bankroll construction and renovations at the Menino, Yawkey, and Moakley buildings on the remaining campus, plus a transport bridge that will ferry patients from a helipad over Albany Street to the medical center.  Overall, the hospital 2019s footprint will shrink by about 329,000 square feet to just under 2.1 million square feet.  The consolidation is expected to save at least $25 million a year through energy efficiencies and the elimination of  201cworkarounds, 201d such as the short ambulance trips to bring patients admitted in the emergency department to neurosurgery and cardiac specialists at Newton Pavilion.  Beyond the savings, there will also be larger and more efficient space for mothers and babies, for intensive care, and for doctors to collaborate.   201cIt 2019s caring for the patients in the right setting, in the most efficient manner, 201d said Bob Biggio, vice president for facilities and support services.  Some of Boston Medical 2019s competitors acknowledge privately that its redevelopment plan is a bold response to a changing health care environment in which hospitals face cuts in government payments for Medicaid and Medicare  2014 the top sources of revenue for Boston Medical, the state 2019s largest safety net hospital.  Despite those reductions and a national decline in the number of inpatient procedures, most hospitals have been reluctant to eliminate beds.  That may be changing in such cities as Boston, however, where academic medical centers also are grappling with reduced funding for research and must adapt to new insurance contracts that reward them for positive health outcomes and for keeping patients out of the hospital.   201cHospitals are going to have to work more efficiently, like other industries, 201d said Harry Glorikian, managing partner at the Cambridge consulting firm Scientia Advisors.  201cIf that means they don 2019t need as many beds, they can apply the savings to optimizing their plants and improving their services.   201cThey will have to manage care more efficiently outside hospitals to reduce admissions, and they will have to do what they do internally more efficiently, as well, 2019 2019 he said.  Leaders of the Massachusetts Nurses Association have protested the decision to close the former University Hospital campus, where more than 450 of its members work as registered nurses. Boston Medical officials say they anticipate their staffing needs will remain constant, so the nurses will be able to move to the consolidated campus. But to do so, they may have to switch their affiliation to the Service Employees International Union, which represents nurses there.   201cWhile management has stated publicly that there will be positions for everyone following the consolidation, they have refused to put that guarantee in writing for the East Newton Campus nurses, 201d said association spokesman David Schildmeier.  201cThese nurses have years of experience providing care to the patient population served by the hospital and they and their patients deserve that the new consolidation will ensure the same level of care. 201d  The issue is under negotiation but is not expected to delay the hospital 2019s consolidation.  During the three-year redevelopment project, Boston Medical would operate on both campuses. Summary: Boston Medical Center is preparing to break ground in the coming weeks on a $270 million construction and renovation project that will consolidate its two campuses in the city 2019s South End and eliminate 60 beds while keeping the same level of services.

I can't. If I lean into it, then I'm going down,  explains Galloway.  This prosthetic has a micro-processor that can add resistance as I'm bending that can slow me down.

            "input": "text:The Wellcome Collection in London is about to open a peep show  2013 and of a kind not seen in Britain for well over a century, since the last public museum of medical waxworks was smashed to pieces by the London Metropolitan police. The Wellcome's normally chaste white galleries have been transformed for a new show called Exquisite Bodies, which gathers together centuries of anatomical models of human bodies and body parts, created to educate, terrify and titillate.  The exhibition's designers say it will be part university lecture, part artist's anatomy lesson, part Victorian fairground booth. The oldest pieces, works made in ivory or wood in the 17th and 18th centuries, come from private collections in Europe. But most of the pieces, made in tinted wax, have a rowdier history, often conveying physical deformity or grotesque disease in lurid detail, and displayed in crowd-thrilling museums and travelling fairs from the 19th century onwards. The Roca museum, the original home of many of the pieces in the show, survived in the red-light district of Barcelona until 1935, and was considered so educational, particularly as a warning against the horrors of venereal disease, that at one point it was maintained by the Red Cross.   We wanted to convey the atmosphere of these displays,  curator Kate Forde says.  They were certainly about educating people, but they were also hugely popular entertainment, at a time before x-rays when the inner workings of their own bodies were a profound mystery to most people.   Most of the pieces are now fragile, and very rare. As these museums fell out of favour, the exhibits were destroyed. Forde has spent years tracking down specimens for the exhibition, adding to those collected in the early 20th century by Henry Wellcome, founder of the Wellcome Trust.  The rooms have been painted dark blue, and filled with extraordinary objects, from a two-headed calf  2013 probably faked  2013 to a cutaway model of a pregnant woman, her serene face betraying nothing of the midwife's hand groping inside her.  Especially arresting are supine naked women, known as  anatomical Venuses , made from the 18th century onwards. They were constructed of wax, wood or ivory so that their stomachs could be opened and internal organs displayed, usually including a pregnant uterus. Most have beautiful faces resembling traditional images of the Madonna, and luxuriant real hair. Although originally modelled for private collections, when any scholarly gentleman's study would include scientific instruments and anatomical treatises, some were also made to educate medical students.  There are also miniature ivory models in the same style.  It used to be thought that these were made to aid women consulting doctors, who could point to the models to show what their problem was, but I think that's most unlikely,  says Forde.  They are far too small, and the detail is too crude to be useful. They are luxury objects, and I wonder if they aren't a kind of executive desk toy, where you would amuse yourself by taking them to pieces and reassembling them.   Draw aside the crimson velvet curtains of the side alcoves, and you expose ever more striking things: human genitalia in extreme stages of disease modelled in flesh-coloured wax featuring real pubic hair, for instance. Whether these are intended to terrify the viewer into virtuous living or offer a curious form of titillation is open to debate.  The Wellcome has always been interested in the permeable membrane between art and science. Generations of art students learned anatomy directly from models originally intended for medical students; dissection was either illegal or specimens difficult to obtain. Detailed watercolour illustrations and engravings were made of dissections, and centuries-old specimens survive preserved in alcohol  2013 but the unique advantage of the model was that it preserved a three-dimensional image with its original colour.  Most were made by highly skilled specialists, of whom the finest was undoubtedly Joseph Towne, born in 1806 in Royston, near Cambridge. As a teenager, he modelled a full-size human skeleton working from observation and book illustrations alone, eventually being directed to London, and then to Guy's hospital in his attempts to find out if it was accurate. Guy's needed an assistant model maker, and the extraordinary model hand Towne made to demonstrate his skill is still in the hospital collection.  He ended up spending his entire working life at Guy's, living and working in the hospital basement. He was so secretive, particularly of his technique for colouring the wax, that he sometimes worked draped in a cloth, and blocked the keyhole of his room.  The most startling aspect of Towne's models is that they are unmistakably portraits of real people, including the head of a child dying of syphilis and a yelling man with a stubbled chin and broken teeth. Many contemporary artists must have been aware of Towne's peculiar genius. He craved recognition for his skill, and his work was often shown in exhibitions that included conventional works of art. His model of a dissected head  2013 included in the Wellcome show  2013 won a Royal Society of Arts gold medal in 1825, and he was included in the Great Exhibition in 1851.  There are many other overlaps with art history in the show. The Belgian surrealist painter Paul Delvaux, who repeatedly visited a Venus in the Spitzner Museum at the Brussels Fair, was only one of many artists fascinated by such figures. Delvaux might even be one of those captured in a photograph from the 1930s, on display here, which shows crowds poring over display cases in a tent in Brussels, their faces in various states of shock or hilarity.  The grotesquely dismembered figures that populate many early surrealist exhibitions strikingly recall these fairground creations, as does the work of many contemporary artists including Louise Bourgeois, the Chapman Brothers and Marc Quinn. Quinn's own sculpture of a naked woman, an eerie body cast of a real woman, Silvia Petretti, in polymer wax mixed with the anti-HIV drugs she was taking, was bought when the Wellcome Collection opened three years ago, and lies on permanent display in a glass case just inside the main door of the building.  The exhibition reflects an aspect of scientific history in which the gallery's founder himself was hugely interested  2013 the meeting point of art and science, and of the academic and the popular. Indeed, Henry Wellcome collected the most beautiful of the Venuses, originally commissioned by a Florentine aristocrat, and the ivory miniatures. Forde is confident he would have loved this show. Summary: Part fairground attraction, part science lesson, a new exhibition of grotesquely lifelike waxworks lifts the curtain on the hidden history of medicine and art",

            "input": "text:BOSTON, Aug. 22 2014 Urging patients out of bed to exercise just days after a coronary does not improve the health of their hearts, a study shows.  The report found that the condition of patients who walked and did calisthenics soon after their heart attacks was identical with that of people who took it easy in the hospital.  ''We were unable to demonstrate any significant beneficial or deleterious effects of an early, in-hospital exercise program,'' the researchers wrote.  The study conducted at seven Seattle hospitals and directed by researchers at the University of Washington School of Nursing was published in the issue published Thursday of the New England Journal of Medicine. 84 Patients in Study  The purpose of prompt exercise after a heart attack is to keep the patient's cardiovascular system from getting out of shape while he is bedridden.  In this study, 84 patients began exercising an average of four and a half days after their admission to the hospital and continued to work out until they were sent home five days later. These men and women exercised with weights and pulleys over their beds and did calisthenics and took walks after they were able to get out of bed.  Before their discharge, their health was compared with that of 174 people who did not exercise. The patients walked on treadmills while doctors conducted electrocardiograph tests and measured their heart rates, blood pressure and fatigue.  Even though there was no difference in the two groups, the researchers said the early exercise may still have a positive effect. ''If one assumes that a sedentary lifestyle is a risk factor and that exercise is a desirable preventive measure, then starting an exercise program during hospitalization when patients are highly motivated may well help to establish a habit of exercise,'' they wrote.

            "input": "text:GREENSBORO, N.C., March 7 2014 The Atlantic Coast Conference championship basketball game started as a thriller between two fine teams today, but became a bore when North Carolina used its four-corner stall in the last eight minutes to preserve a 1-point lead and beat Virginia, 47-45.  By winning the title, North Carolina, ranked No. 1 in the nation in the weekly wire-service polls, earned an automatic bid to the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament that starts Thursday. The Tar Heels, with a 27-2 record, are seeded first in the East regional and will begin play in a second-round game Saturday at Charlotte.  Virginia (29-3), which was ranked No.3 last week, received an atlarge spot and was seeded first in the Mideast regional. It plays a second-round game Sunday in Indianapolis.  Coach Dean Smith, whose trademark is the four-corner setup he favors as a means of holding a lead, said: ''You saw a great game until eight minutes to play. It could have been great if they came out and chased us, and then we shot some layups.''  But Virginia did not go out, and the Tar Heels, in possession with a 44-43 lead and 7:34 remaining, called time and went into their stall. They did not shoot for 7 minutes 6 seconds.  The four-corner stall was once called the four-corner offense, but no offense appeared to be intended today. James Worthy, Mike Jordan, Jimmy Black, Matt Doherty and Sam Perkins played catch until Virginia committed its seventh foul of the half, which sent Doherty to the line with 28 seconds left. He made the first shot and missed the second in a one-and-one situation, putting the Tar Heels up by 45-43.  Virginia then went upcourt with time to tie the game. But the Cavaliers lost their last chance when the freshman Jim Miller, pressured by Black, lost the ball out of bounds. Doherty was then fouled again and hit both free throws. Ralph Sampson, Virginia's 7-foot-4-inch center, made an uncontested stuff at the buzzer.  Doherty did not mind the four corners, saying: ''I don't care about the image of the sport. It was good for Carolina basketball because we won the game.''  ''I'm not getting involved in that controversy,'' said Terry Holland, Virginia's coach, when asked about the tactic. ''North Carolina did what it thought it had to do to win.''  The finish was in stark contrast to the start. Worthy, the all-America forward, set the pace when he took the opening tip and went in for a stuff basket. Carolina quickly ran off 8 straight points. Worthy Controls Offense  Worthy was a terror on offense, scoring 14 of his 16 points in the first seven and a half minutes. He made five of his first seven shots and was credited with the other two when Sampson was charged with goaltending twice.  Virginia began to come back as both teams kept up a fast pace that had the 16,034 fans in Greenboro Coliseum screaming. A transition battle was waged into the second half.  Sampson, who had been standing around, began to get involved in the action. And the Cavaliers slowed down Worthy by crowding him. Virginia, which had started so poorly, finally got the lead, 35-34, at 1:21 of the second half when Tim Mullen broke in for a backdoor basket. A few minutes later, Jordan, the freshman forward, hit four long shots to give the Tar Heels a 44-41 edge. Jeff Jones's 25-footer cut the lead to 44-43.  It was then that Smith called time and installed the four corners. ''A coach thinks to win a game under the rules,'' he said afterward. ''We were just trying to win, and did. They have a 7-4 guy you want to get out from under the basket, and he won't come out. If Sampson had come out, it might have been different. When I use the four corners and win, I'm a genius. When I use it and we lose, I'm all wrong.''  Sampson did come out and challenge the Tar Heels late in the game, when Virginia knew it had to foul for a chance to get possession. But for more than five minutes he had been standing under the basket.  Worthy, who had all his 16 points in the first half, was voted the outstanding player of the playoffs. The slow finish resulted in some unusual statistics: This was first A.C.C. title game since 1970 to have totaled fewer than 100 points; North Carolina had only three turnovers, and each team attempted only nine shots in the second half. Sampson Held to 12 Points  Sampson did not have an impressive playoff; he scored 12 points today for a total of 31 in three games. He had five rebounds, only one in the second half, for a total of 18.  Virginia was without Othell Wilson, its playmaker and secondhighest scorer, who suffered a thigh injury in the first-round victory over Clemson Friday night.  This was North Carolina's 10th A.C.C. title, more than any of the seven other teams in the league, and its second straight. It was the ninth under Smith, who has been coach since 1962. Smith has taken six North Carolina teams to the Final Four of the N.C.A.A. tournament, but has not won the championship. Memphis State 73, Louisville 62  MEMPHIS, March 7 (AP) - Keith Lee, a 6-10 freshman, scored 27 points as Memphis State won the Metro Conference tournament. Lee also had 15 rebounds and was named the tournament's most valuable player.  Memphis State (23-4), the league's regular-season champion, never trailed, opening a 4-0 lead and extending it to 35-28 at halftime. Louisville (20-9) opened the second half with a scoring spurt and pulled to 39-37 at 17:23, but Memphis State outscored the Cardinals, 22-7, to take a 61-45 lead at 9:33.  It was the third meeting this year between the Cardinals and the Tigers. Each won at home during the regular season.

            "input": "text:NEW YORK, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Bashing China is a time-honored tradition among U.S. candidates for higher public office, and no one has done that with more zest in this election cycle than billionaire Donald Trump.  Beijing handed the Republican presidential hopeful more ammunition to rail against China when it devalued the yuan on Tuesday, and Trump did not miss a chance.   (China) continuously cuts their currency, they devalue their currency,  Trump said on Wednesday during a campaign stop in Birch Run, Michigan.  They've been doing this for years - this isn't just starting.   Short-term events aside, though, data shows China's yuan has in fact been strengthening over the last 10 years, dramatically so. And while its appreciation against the dollar has abated in the last couple of years, the yuan has continued rising against the currencies of most of its trade partners, including Japan and the euro zone.  A weak currency lowers the price of a country's exports, making them more attractive to international buyers.   It is hard to call the yuan weak. It is less strong,  said Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.  Over the last decade, the trade-weighted yuan index, a measure of its value against the currencies of China's main trading partners, has risen by 43 percent, according to data from the Bank for International Settlements.  A Trump spokesperson was not immediately available to comment. Trump was not the only Republican candidate to weigh in on the yuan, as Senator Lindsay Graham of South Carolina called China's actions  just the latest in a long history of cheating.  Other U.S. elected officials from both parties have criticized China's moves as well.  The yuan has fallen 2.9 percent against the U.S. dollar over the last two days, 3.0 percent against the yen in the same period, and 1.6 percent against the Korean won, currencies of three of China's largest trading partners. Markets worldwide have been roiled for the last two days since Beijing devalued its currency.  But the currency's fall thus far only offsets some recent trade-weighted gains. Against the euro, for instance, the yuan has strengthened 5 percent in 2015. It is up more than 4 percent against the Korean won, and nearly 13 percent against the Malaysian ringgit.  The yuan's trade-weighted index is constructed as follows: 31.7 percent is weighted to emerging Asia - countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia - 18.5 percent to the United States, 17.4 percent to Japan and 16.2 percent to the euro zone. Other industrial countries, central and eastern Europe and Latin America make up the remaining 16 percent.   So China has weakened more than 2 percent in the last two days, big deal, does that really take away Malaysia's competitiveness?  said Chandler.  In fact, the U.S. dollar is one of the few spots where the yuan has failed to gain headway in 2015, sliding 3 percent. The dollar has strengthened against almost all currencies for most of 2014 and 2015 as investors factored in expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike.  But in 2013, the yuan had gained 2.8 percent against the dollar, and in 2012, had risen 1 percent.  Still, if what is still a modest decline in the yuan turns into a full-blown slump, a  broader part of the political spectrum in the U.S. will voice concern,  wrote Jens Nordvig, global currency strategist at Nomura. Given that the change in China's policy makes its currency more sensitive to market movements, the Obama administration may not react negatively initially.   If we get 5 percent quickly, then Congress can turn quickly,  Nordvig told Reuters.  Late on Wednesday, the dollar was up 1 percent against the yuan at 6.3870.  Chandler urged market participants to wait and see how all this would play out.  It may not be that bad after all.

But Emani quickly realized there was no room for the boy at the overcrowded hospital. Under sedation, the boy waited for weeks until Emani could fix the holes in his heart.  It 2019s a story that doctors and executives at Children 2019s, the region 2019s dominant pediatric care center, tell again and again: They don 2019t have enough beds, surgeries are being delayed, patients are being turned away and sent to other hospitals. And it 2019s why executives say they need to complete a $1 billion expansion of their Longwood Medical Area campus, a project that would create an 11-story tower with more room for doctors and nurses to treat more patients.  Yet the hospital 2019s message has been undercut recently by a group opposed to the proposal for reasons that have nothing to do with surgeries or beds. They object to the plan to build the tower over the Prouty Garden, a tranquil refuge for countless sick and dying children and their families. And many have emotional stories to tell.   201cThe hospital is out of touch. I don 2019t think they totally see what they 2019re going to lose, 201d said Beecher Grogan, whose daughter, Lucy, liked to wiggle her toes in garden 2019s grass before she died from leukemia at age 12.  How do you put a price tag on a place where two generations of sick children escaped their hospital beds?   201cThey should absolutely build a building, 201d Grogan said,  201cbut anywhere but there. 201d  The group Friends of the Prouty Garden, a group backed by an anonymous donor, has raised enough money to take out full-page ads in the Globe and hire a lawyer and public relations firm. Its online petition to preserve the garden has nearly 14,000 signatures, and it has the backing of some prominent physicians, such as Dr. T. Berry Brazelton.  Hospital executives may have been caught off guard by the backlash, but now they 2019re trying to defend their case. They say they examined at least nine scenarios before settling on the plan to build over the Prouty Garden. All of the other options were too costly, would take too long to build, or would be too far from the hospital 2019s other facilities, resulting in inefficiencies and higher costs, they say.   201cWe looked at the cost-effectiveness, we looked at the time it would take, we looked at what it would bring us in terms of patient care, 201d said Dr. Kevin Churchwell, the chief operating officer at Children 2019s.  201cWhen we put it all on the grid, the building that we 2019re going to build really fit the best. 201d  The debate will play out at a public hearing Thursday afternoon before the Department of Public Health. State regulators are reviewing whether the hospital 2019s proposed expansion is appropriate, as they do with all major capital projects. They have also asked Children 2019s, one of the state 2019s priciest hospitals, to pay for an independent study that shows what effect the project will have on health care costs.  The Prouty Garden at Children 2019s Hospital.  To soften the blow of eliminating the Prouty Garden, executives are planning to build three green spaces into their expanded campus: a rooftop garden, an outdoor garden, and indoor gardens that can survive the winter and bring a little peace to children too sick to go outside.  Rising patient numbers  2014 not just from Massachusetts, but from other states and countries where Children 2019s is seeking growth  2014 have made the hospital a crowded place. And the numbers continue to grow as Children 2019s cements its reputation as a place for treating the world 2019s smallest and sickest patients. The hospital admitted more than 24,349 patients in the year ended Sept. 30, up 1.8 percent from the previous year.  All but four of the hospital 2019s 404 beds were full on Wednesday, and 50 children were being treated in the emergency room. In the neonatal intensive care unit, tiny babies slept in cribs crammed into a small room, surrounded by supply cabinets, as clinicians and family members shuffled by. Parents who wanted privacy with their sick newborns were out of luck.  Children 2019s executives say the expansion project, the largest proposed by a Massachusetts hospital, will change all of this. It will add dozens of beds and eliminate room-sharing, an inconvenience that also puts patients at greater risk of catching infections. In the new space, each patient  2014 even newborns  2014 will have a private room.   201cIt 2019s not just adding beds, 201d chief executive Sandra L.

In total, the project is pegged at $1.5 billion and is scheduled to take five years to complete.  Prouty Garden supporters say the hospital doesn 2019t have to choose between the garden and the expansion project.  The half-acre garden is the  201csoul 201d of the hospital, they say, a place that provides the kind of healing that 2019s not possible within hospital walls.

King Jigme Singye Wangchuck has been slowly pulling his isolated mountain state into the modern world and has declared his desire to relinquish some of his powers.  A draft constitution has been drawn up and elections were to 00c2 have been held 00c2 for the country's first parliament.  But royal astrologers believe that the stars will not be favourably placed until 2008 for the country, wedged between India and China, to take the plunge and abandon royal rule.  A palace official, who asked not to be named, said:  The king took their advice very seriously. That's the reason why he has decided to hold the first democratic elections in the kingdom in 2008.   A referendum on the new constitution will now be put to the country's 700,000 people early in 2008, and if it is passed elections will be held before the end of that year.  The draft keeps the king as the head of state, but parliament 00c2 - consisting of two houses, a 75-member National Assembly and a 25-member National Council - would have the power to impeach him with a two-thirds majority vote.  In 2001, Wangchuck, who became king in 1972 at the age of 16 after the death of his father, initiated the drafting of a new constitution, a document he made public 00c2 last March. 00c2  00c2  00c2  00c2  In December he announced that he would also hand over the throne to his son, Crown Prince Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, in 2008.  More than 100,000 Bhutanese of Nepali-origin living in refugee camps in eastern Nepal on the border with India have rejected the draft constitution and their leaders have vowed to defend their rights, by force if necessary.

The refugees say they were ignored when officials prepared the draft constitution, and are campaigning for their right to return to the country and vote in elections, as well as constitutional protection for their customs and religion.  Bhutan has remained untouched by most modern influences, with a limited number of foreign visitors allowed each year.  Television arrived in 1999 and the internet a year later.  Whether the king will pay them as much attention as he has paid his astrologers remains to be seen, with talks over their fate stalled since 2003.

In its latest report, Treasury said Monday that total holdings increased 0.8% to a record $6.29 trillion. The figure climbed even though China, the largest holder of Treasury debt, trimmed its portfolio by 0.6% to $1.24 trillion.  For the first time since 1974, when the government began releasing data on foreign ownership of Treasury securities, the report broke out ownership for specific countries that it had always lumped together such as  201coil exporting nations 201d and  201cCaribbean banking centers. 201d  The report showed that Saudi Arabia in March held $116.8 billion in Treasury debt, down 2.5% from February.  A Treasury spokesperson said that the decision to start listing Saudi Arabia 2019s holdings separately was not linked in any way to recent warnings from the government of Saudi Arabia. Last month Saudi Arabia said that it could begin selling off its U.S. investments if Congress passes a law allowing the country to be held responsible in U.S. courts for any role in the Sept. 11,2001, terrorist attacks.  The break-out of the investments held by Saudi Arabia makes the country the 13th largest foreign holder of Treasury securities. The Cayman Islands, which previously was included in a grouping of Caribbean banking centers, ranks No. 3, behind China and Japan. It held $265 billion in March, up 3.9% from February.  Treasury spokesperson Whitney Smith said de-grouping certain countries is an effort to make the data more useful.   201cWe concluded that it was consistent with transparency and the law to disclose the data in a disaggregated fashion, 201d Smith said in a statement.  The new report showed that Japan, the second largest foreign holder of debt, increased its holdings by 0.4% to $1.14 trillion in March.  The $6.29 trillion in total foreign holdings of Treasury debt was a modest 1.9% higher than a year ago.  Of that total, 65% is held by foreign governments, primarily central banks.  The national debt now stands at $19.16 trillion. With the federal budget deficit projected to grow over the next decade, the United States will need to see continued strong foreign demand for Treasury debt to help finance its growing borrowing needs.

Chris Christie and that his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was running the VP vetting effort with a group that included former Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson and himself.  Now we have more names.  In an interview with Greta van Susteren on Fox News on Tuesday night, he suggested he was considering former Arizona governor Jan Brewer and Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin. And now Bloomberg reports that Trump 2019s campaign has been giving a close look at former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Trump has been asking his advisors about Gingrich during conversations at the Trump Tower in New York, according to Bloomberg.  Rick Tyler, who was an aide to Gingrich for 12 years in Congress and also worked with the former House Speaker during his 2012 presidential bid, told Bloomberg that he was  201cconfident 201d that the 72-year-old Gingrich was being considered and thought he could act as a kind of senior policy advisor to Trump, in the way that Dick Cheney did with George W. Bush.  While not publicly campaigning for the job, Gingrich has been an outspoken cheerleader for Trump while others 2014i.e. current House Speaker Paul Ryan 2014have been less enthusiastic. When asked why he thought Trump would be a good president in an interview with TIME published this week, Gingrich gave this response:  I think he has the potential to be an extraordinarily dynamic president who shakes up a bureaucratic city that badly needs to be shaken up. I think that the bureaucracies in Washington have gotten the attitude that they run the country, not that the country runs them. And I think in a free society, that 2019s very unhealthy.  He also gave some suggestions as to what he thought Trump should look for in a VP:  I think there are three characteristics: Is it a person who could actually be president if something happened to the president? Are they compatible in their ideas and attitudes, could they work together as a team? And third, do they do at least a little bit to help win the election. I think you think of them in that order and they have to pass each of the three tests.  Gingrich offered some candidates he would eye, with this in mind: Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.); Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa); and Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin.  But when he was asked if he would take the job himself, Gingrich got cagey.  201cI 2019m not going to get into that. I think that 2019s very unlikely, 201d he said.  201cThere are many good potential candidates. 201d  Still, if Trump does sign up Gingrich, they 2019ll have at least one thing in common (besides preternaturally buoyant hair): they 2019re both on their third attempt at marital bliss.

            "input": "text:Roger Clemens insists that he trains more vigorously now than he did as a young major leaguer. At least one of his old pitching coaches has a hard time believing it. Bill Fischer recalled one of Clemens' starts in 1989, when he lasted only one-third of an inning, departed the mound in anger and immediately returned to work.  He got his wife out of the stands at Fenway, took a bucket of balls and drove around until he found a city field that was empty,  says Fischer, the Red Sox pitching coach from 1985-91.  He brought his spikes, threw 125 balls at the backstop and made her pick them up. I asked him what he was doing. He said he didn't get enough work in the game.    Clemens, now 36 and a Yankee, has found a way to address that problem. At an age when most successful major league pitchers are in the twilight of their careers and when most power pitchers must learn to adjust their styles, Clemens remains one of the game's hardest throwers - largely, close observers believe - because he trains and prepares for his starts with greater zeal than anyone in the history of the game.  Ninety-nine-point-nine percent of pitchers in the game could not complete his program,  says Al Nipper, Clemens' former teammate and another former pitching coach in Boston.  No way. They couldn't keep up with him. He'd kill them.    Brian McNamee would agree. As the Blue Jays strength and conditioning coach, he worked closely with Clemens last year in Toronto and marveled at the pace the pitcher kept.  He goes about his workouts with the same intensity as he goes about the games,  McNamee says.  He does a lot of necessary things a lot of pitchers might be afraid to do, especially younger pitchers. He has those four days (between starts) and he goes at it.    And on the days that Clemens pitches?  He will do more before he goes out to start warming up,  McNamee says,  than some guys do all week.    Clemens notes proudly that he was  clocked three or four times last year at 100 mph,  and scouts say he often throws 96. Addressing his uncanny ability to throw so hard for so many years, Clemens acknowledges that  a lot of it has to do with conditioning. You figure out how to include your legs with your arms to remain a power pitcher.    Maintaining such power is not nearly as easy as Clemens makes it seem. Few pitchers in history have thrown with exceptional velocity past age 35, as Clemens has. Nolan Ryan did it. Randy Johnson, 13 months younger than Clemens, has done it. Tom Seaver says he did so  to a degree  but he never had more than 200 strikeouts after age 34. Seaver recalls that he began to lose his power in his  mid-30s, right about where Roger is.    Once able to throw  75 or 80 fastballs a game out of 130 pitches,  Seaver says his heat gradually dissipated until, at age 38 or 39, his per game supply of fastballs was down to  10 or 15 ... where I felt I could throw it right past somebody.    Seaver points to a game he pitched for the White Sox against the Red Sox with Carlton Fisk catching in 1985 as evidence of the concessions he had to make as he got older. He had runners on second and third with one out in one of the late innings, with Mike Easler and Tony Armas due to bat. Seaver threw six straight fastballs, struck out both hitters and escaped the inning.  I walked into the dugout and told Pudge, 'Don't expect that pitch anymore,'   Seaver says.  He asked me where that came from. I said 'I don't have any more. I had a few. I was saving them.  '   Clemens, a teammate of Seaver's in Boston for half the 1986 season, remembers how Seaver pumped up his fastball a few times each game, a concept that still seems foreign to Clemens. Asked if he could feel a difference in his fastball now compared to 10 years ago, the only five-time Cy Young Award winner said,  Not really. When my legs are strong and right, I can get behind a ball and turn it loose.    How does he do it? Longtime Clemens watchers point to a combination of factors: naturally sound mechanics that minimize strain on his right arm; exceptional lower body strength; good nutritional habits; and the determination to undertake a more difficult training regimen each year.  I think it was nature that made him so good early,  Yankees pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre says.  I think it's his work and conditioning that keep him that way.    Clemens offers the public only a glimpse of his physical regime. He acknowledges that he runs three or three-and-a-half miles three times between his starts, and that he strengthens his right hand by manipulating it in a bucket of rice, just as Steve Carlton once did. Clemens reveals only generalities about the year-round daily workouts he conducts with only a two-week break after the season.  When I was 29 or 30, I waited and I got more and more sore,  Clemens says.  I went zero to 80, but it took time to recover.    By speaking in such broad strokes, Clemens suggests that his conditioning program lacks real form. In fact, he adheres to a detailed routine that makes his workouts as purposeful as his time on the mound - and the results are every bit as impressive. McNamee, a Queens native who has a master's degree in exercise physiology, worked with Clemens last season to update an already rigorous training schedule. Together they created a rotating five-day regimen aimed at building total body strength, but particularly the legs, abdomen, groin and arm.  Four days go very quick between his starts,  McNamee says.  ... The day off was the day he pitched.    Throughout Clemens' workouts, John Cougar Mellencamp usually blared in the exercise room.  He's a creature of habit,  McNamee says. Though he has refined his workouts in recent years, Clemens' habitual sweat sessions began long ago. Nipper, who joined the Red Sox rotation at almost the same time Clemens did in 1984, recalled that they used to run four or five miles through downtown Boston on days when one of them wasn't preparing to pitch. They likewise ran all the stadium stairs in each ballpark they visited.  His mindset was 'I want to prepare myself to pitch 15 innings every single start,'   Nipper says. Clemens had to rededicate himself to training following a four-year span in Boston from 1993-96, when he was a combined 40-39. Nipper, his pitching coach the last two of those years, recalled that Clemens had  some groin problems and mechanically, he got into a rut.     He was trying to protect his groin,  Nipper says.  His drop step was different. He wasn't getting back and getting balanced like he had been. His fastball didn't have the juice it had. He had to do something to keep up with the workload, so he got much stronger in his lower half.    So much stronger, Fischer believes, that Clemens' fastball actually had more oomph the past two years in Toronto than it did during his final four years in Boston.  He said, 'Hell, throwing a fastball is what I do,'   Fischer says. Gordon Lakey, the Phillies' director of major league scouting, has watched Clemens pitch at every level since high school. While serving as a special assistant to Blue Jays GM Gord Ash late in 1996, Lakey recommended that the club offer Clemens the four-year contract he was seeking, in part because of how well he still threw his fastball. Lakey estimated that Clemens threw between 75 and 80% fastballs in his first few major league seasons, along with a decent slider and curveball, and that he threw 65% fastballs the last few seasons, complemented by a devastating forkball that  made hitters look in two planes.    Perhaps as much as his fastball, Clemens' knowledge of hitters and outstanding command have fueled the career resurrection that resulted in his two Cy Young Awards the past two years. But what Lakey called  his gift of power  continued to set him apart. Where will it end? McNamee suggested that Clemens' unparalleled work ethic could allow him to push beyond commonly accepted limits of physiology for middle-aged men.  I told him I'd like to see him get 300 wins and then become a closer and get 300 saves,  McNamee says.  He could do it. But he says, 'I'm a starting pitcher. That's how I'm built.  '  Clemens also is built with a couple of physical flaws that eventually may undermine his work. Lakey acknowledged that Clemens was prone to hamstring and groin problems that someday could cut his power, but added that he did not anticipate Clemens breaking down. Clemens' recent stay on the DL with a strained hamstring - he returned to the lineup yesterday in a 10-2 drubbing of the White Sox in which he set the American League record for consecutive wins with 18 - could be somewhat of an omen. The injury had stopped him from pitching, curtailed his all-important workouts and heightened his irritation.  He enjoys all of it,  Fischer says.  If he can't do it all, that's when he'll retire.    Roger Clemens' durability almost invites scientific study, and he apparently agrees. For more than a decade, Clemens has been keeping careful records about how his body functions. Clemens hopes his journals will benefit someone other than himself. With the help of his sister, Brenda, Clemens said he is attempting to develop a computer program that could improve the way amateur pitchers - from Little League through college - keep track of their physical conditioning. Clemens regularly makes detailed journal entries about his strenuous physical conditioning. He reviews computer files that help him structure his workouts.  I can go back and look at last year before the All-Star break and see that I was feeling weak for two weeks,  Clemens says.  I thought my strength was down. I thought my leg strength was down. So I squatted for 10 days. Then I noticed my performance, my leg strength was better.  I review it sometimes weekly, sometimes just once a month. I'll program a certain weight that I know I should be at. I'll watch that, as far as my running program. How I felt when I lifted. How I felt if I benched or did some curls and how it affected my arm. There's all kind of things I can break it down to.    Clemens said he began keeping a journal in 1988 as an extension of books many pitchers keep on hitters. Ex-Red Sox teammate Dwight Evans encouraged Clemens to think seriously about the impact of nutrition on performance, and Clemens said he  started really monitoring all that I do, everything from how I felt to when I ate.    LET'S GET PHYSICAL Roger Clemens' workout regimen according to Brian McNamee, the Blue Jays strength and conditioning coach: DAY 1 (following a start):  Navy SEAL drills,  McNamee called them. For 35 minutes, he kept Clemens in constant motion, performing cardiovascular drills, upper body, lower body and explosion exercises, with no breaks between. DAY 2: Clemens performed an indoor session, consisting of 25 minutes on an exercise bike, 25 minutes on a treadmill and 400 of what McNamee called  power abs,  abdominal exercises that he developed for the pitcher. DAY 3: Clemens began with a three-and-a-half mile run, continued with two sets each of 25 repetitions of side shuffles, power abs, and stair climbers. The workout concluded with 50 line drops, in which Clemens would face McNamee and run backwards until McNamee would drop a ball. Clemens would run forward, pick up the ball, return it and begin again. DAY 4: During batting practice, Clemens ran 15 sprints, followed by 24 hours of what McNamee called  complete shutdown  in advance of his start. DAY 5 (start): In perhaps the most surprising part of his schedule, Clemens undertook a battery of exercises beginning about an hour before a game. At the SkyDome, he would run five to 10 of the stadium ramps and do exercises in a prone position with five or 10-pound dumbbells. Clemens performed resistance exercises with surgical tubing for his pitching arm, shoulder shrugs using 40- or 50-pound weights, five minutes of full-body stretching, more power abs -  to induce fatigue,  McNamee said - and concluded by standing before a full-length mirror and going through his delivery five to 10 times. Summary: Roger Clemens insists that he trains more vigorously now than he did as a young major leaguer. At least one of his old pitching coaches has a hard time believing it. Bill Fischer recalled one of Clemens' starts in 1989, when he lasted only one-third of an inning, departed the mound in anger and immediately returned to work.  He got his wife out of the stands at Fenway, took a bucket of balls and drove",

He used the N-word on the last day of black history month,  Williams said in a video interview posted Tuesday on TMZ.com.  The entertainer, whose real name is Micah Williams, was arrested on a battery charge in Georgia on Monday after the staffer at Leslie's Pool Supplies in Gainsville told cops Williams punched him around 11:30 a.m.  Williams,44, was booked and released in time to make a separate court hearing Tuesday for an unrelated criminal case in southern California.  KATT WILLIAMS ARRESTED AFTER PUNCHING GEORGIA STORE EMPLOYEE  It was outside the Tuesday hearing that Williams said the store employee was to blame.   He thought that when he was having a conversation with me that I was in his pool store to rob it,  Katt told TMZ.  When I put 30 items on the counter, he then thought it was just a ploy to distract him.   Williams claimed he put fifteen $100 bills on the counter in an apparent gesture to prove he didn't need to shoplift, and the store employee allegedly scooped up the cash and put it in his pocket.  When Williams asked for his money back, the unidentified man told him he was new to the job, didn't care about losing it and wanted Williams to leave, the comedian claimed.   I said, 'I can't get out of the store without my packages or without my money,'  Williams told TMZ.  He said, 'Oh, you can get out the store, or you can go to jail.'   That's when the employee allegedly used the N-word, Williams claimed.  The interview excerpts posted on TMZ didn't include a denial from Katt that he punched the man, but they elaborated on Williams' decision to go outside and wait for cops while lying on the ground.   So Katt Williams did what Katt Williams had to do as a black man that is self-employed. And Katt Williams went out to the middle of the street and assumed the position so that the hard-working police officers that ran up on him with nine police cars and guns drawn understood that they weren't dealing with a criminal,  Williams said, referring to himself in the third person.   This is my 19th visit to Atlanta, and I'm not from there. Now Georgia no longer gets the comedy of Katt Williams,  he said.  A female employee who answered the phone at the pool supply store Tuesday referred questions to an executive at the company's corporate office in Phoenix.  A message for the executive was not immediately returned Tuesday.  Gainesville police have confirmed Williams was on the ground with his hands behind his back when police arrived.  A store employee told officers that Williams was in the store with two women and threw a pair of goggles during the fight, Sgt. Kevin Holbrook said.  Williams then went behind the counter and punched the employee at least once, the alleged victim told police.  Williams was booked into jail at 1:34 p.m. and faces a misdemeanor battery charge, authorities said.  The stand-up comic has a long history of run-ins with the law, including arrests for inciting a bar fight and leading cops on a bizarre street chase while driving a three-wheel motorcycle.  His Tuesday case in Los Angeles County Superior Court stems from a 2014 fight with a man near LAX Airport.  Williams also is charged alongside co-defendant Suge Knight in a case involving the alleged robbery of a high-end camera from a press photographer in 2014.  He has pleaded not guilty in that felony case. Summary: Comedian Katt Williams says his arrest for punching a shop employee started when the comedian was called a slur.",

            "input": "text:The first season of the US TV series The Strain ended with The Master, source of New York 2019s vampire infection and one of the oldest vampires in existence, escaping our human heroes again. And he did so by scampering across roof-tops in full daylight  2013 something vampire lore says most bloodsuckers can never do. We were all left wondering: what fresh hells, what weird mutations of the vampire rules will season 2 bring?  The series is based on the collaborative novels of screenwriter Chuck Hogan and major horror and science-fiction film director Guillermo del Toro. The Strain does a neat update and twist on Bram Stoker 2019s Dracula. Instead of Count Dracula 2019s entry via a spectral boat, we get a plane-load of (un)dead plague victims in New York. Instead of Dracula 2019s lair in Piccadilly, just a stone 2019s throw from Buckingham Palace, The Master nests in the old tunnels under New York 2019s Freedom Tower. Instead of Stoker 2019s vampire hunter Van Helsing, we have the cantankerous Abraham Setrakian, who first encountered The Master in the Auschwitz concentration camp in 1944. And instead of Stoker 2019s Christian band of brothers who come together to expel the evil from the British Empire, we have a mixed group of antsy New York immigrants  2013 Ukrainians, Jews and Hispanics, men and women.  The Strain is just the latest mutation of the vampire formula established by Bram Stoker 2019s Dracula, which appeared in Queen Victoria 2019s Diamond Jubilee year of 1897. The first major adaptation was FW Murnau 2019s expressionist masterpiece, Nosferatu(1922)  2013 Stoker 2019s widow sued the studio behind the film for breaching copyright. But Dracula isn 2019t the only source of the vampire myths. The Strain owes much of its power to an even older tradition of vampire stories in the West that stretches back another 150 years.  The word  2018vampyre 2019 first appeared in English in the London Journalin March 1732. This awkward word had been transported directly from confused reports about a bizarre incident on the far-flung edges of the Hapsburg empire. In Medreyga, a village in rural Hungary, peasants had created a disturbance by demanding the body of their recently deceased neighbour, Arnold Paul, be dug up. It had been a month since his death and burial. They claimed to the local authorities that his unquiet corpse was menacing them and causing local livestock to waste away in the fields at night. The word they used for this ambivalent creature, stuck between life and death, was  2018vampyre 2019.  On opening the grave, it was alleged that the body of Arnold Paul was witnessed by reliable Hapsburg agents to appear perfectly fresh and undecayed, and also bloated with fresh blood that frothed from the mouth. The peasants pinned the body in the grave with a stake through the heart and then burnt the remains, just to be sure.  A few years later, a Benedictine monk, Augustin Calmet, gathered a lot of similar accounts together in a large tome subtitled Concerning the Vampires of Hungary, Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia. It is from these marginal territories that vampires emerge. Dracula 2019s castle in Transylvania on the very edge of Europe, was where the light of Christendom flickered feebly against the dark unknown of the Ottoman Empire beyond.  Stories of vampires in the 18th Century functioned largely to mock the superstitions of stupid peasants. This reassured a sophisticated metropolitan culture, who circulated these narratives in their new-fangled newspapers and magazines, that London, Paris or Vienna had overcome the tyranny of Medieval beliefs. The cities were full of rational, enlightened citizens who no longer believed such things.  Voltaire thought the silly fashion for these uncanny stories was over. How wrong he was  In Paris, the rational philosopher Voltaire began his entry on vampires in his 1762 Philosophical Dictionary:  201cWhat? Is it in our 18th Century that vampires still exist? 201d He confidently predicted that although Western Europe  201chad been infected with vampires for five or six years 201d in these sensational accounts,  201cthere are now no more. 201d The silly fashion for entertaining with these uncanny stories was over. How wrong he was.  The peasant vampire of Eastern European folklore was a ponderous corpse that disturbed the peace but was relatively easy to destroy. The seductive, corrupting aristocratic vampire arrived in 1819 with a short story by William Polidori published with much sensation in the London press. Lord Ruthven is the title character of The Vampyre, a bloated, lustful beast who preys on young women, particularly terrifying because he does so in the most exclusive salons of society. The vampire has moved from the folkloric margins of the peasantry to fuse with the melodramatic image of the aristocratic libertine.  The added spice was that William Polidori had been briefly appointed as personal doctor to the most notorious aristocrat in England, Lord Byron. The legendary poet had been hounded out of England for his scandalous sex life. During that exile, Polidori had been present at the famous evening at the Villa Diodati near Lake Geneva in 1816 when Byron and his guests Percy and Mary Shelley told ghost stories to each other. The literary vampire was born alongside Baron Frankenstein 2019s monster. Soon after this occasion, Byron summarily fired his doctor.  The vampire as a louche devil who corrupts through sex and money as much as through his bite  There is more than a dash of Byron in Lord Ruthven. Some gossip-mongers even assumed that The Vampyre, which appeared anonymously at first, was either a portrait of Byron or an actual confession by the debauched lord. If Polidori had wanted revenge on his boss, this rather backfired. The story only increased Byron 2019s notoriety and sales. The Vampyre was reprinted and dramatized widely across Europe, but often without Polidori being credited. The doctor died soon afterwards, a failed writer.  The vampire as a louche devil who corrupts through sex and money as much as through his bite has never quite gone away. It was this vision that inspired a long-running 1840s serial, Varney the Vampire, or The Feast of Blood, in which the genre was twisted around to include debauched aristocratic women who bathed in the blood of virgin girls to keep an eternal youth. The most famous literary version of this was Sheridan Le Fanu 2019s feverish short story Carmilla from 1872, the narrative that launched a thousand scurrilous lesbian vampire fantasies. Le Fanu was also a newspaper editor who gave Bram Stoker his first writing job. The first version of Draculawas set in Styria in Austria, where Le Fanu 2019s Carmilla had taken place.  The Strain shows that the vampire haunts the world 2019s centres of power. A hundred years ago it was imperial London: now it is the financial and political powerhouse, New York, where The Master 2019s invasion is aided by the Stoneheart Corporation, run by Wall Street execs seeking eternal life. Almost as soon as the vampyre was named in print in English, it was put into service as an allegory for the  2018blood-suckers 2019 of bankers and usurers in the City of London. The Strain again borrows from tradition.  The show is also clearly related to the  2018zombie apocalypse 2019 genre, the first season showing the slow beginnings of a disease outbreak that is a scientific, viral rendering of the old supernatural infection. In the first season, we watched New York decline steadily into chaos and riot, the undead massing in the sewers and killing openly on the streets. In a country that currently simmers with racial tension and fears the consequences of growing economic inequality, it is clear the makers of The Strain trade on this apocalyptic anxiety. If there is a worry that the series sometimes uses imagery of invading vermin that comes from a tradition of demonising the immigrant poor, the story is also working to assemble a multicultural band of heroes who will restore a vision of America as a melting pot. This vision, of a group of disparate individuals banding together to take down an implacable foe and succeeding, is also embedded in two hundred years of vampire stories. Perhaps that 2019s why vampire tales endure  2013 in the eerie shadows where bloodsuckers creep there is a vision of doom, but also of hope as well.  Roger Luckhurst is a professor at Birkbeck College in London. He has edited the Oxford World 2019s Classics edition of Dracula and his new book, Zombies: A Cultural History, is out in August 2015.

This all started Tuesday as voters in Utah and Arizona were going to the polls, when Trump tweeted, then erased, and then tweeted again a missile against Cruz:  201cLyin 2019 Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad.

Or, you could support Ted Cruz on Tuesday. 201d The ad, run by an outside group backing Cruz, was clearly meant to target Mormon voters in Utah leery of Trump 2019s three marriages, his most recent to supermodel Melania, 26 years his junior.  Cruz won Utah with 69% of the vote; Trump came in third with 14% after Ohio Gov. John Kasich with 16%  2014 which is perhaps why on Wednesday Trump retweeted a supporter 2019s tweet which showed a snarling Heidi Cruz 2019s face next to a gorgeous shot of Melania with this tag line:  201cNo need to  2018Spill the beans, 2019 the images are worth a thousand words. 201d  Cruz defended his wife on Twitter and at a press conference called Trump a  201csniveling coward 201d for attacking women.  201cDonald does seem to have an issue with women. Donald doesn 2019t like strong women, 201d Cruz said.  201cReal men don 2019t try to bully women. That 2019s not an action of strength. That 2019s an action of weakness. It 2019s an action of fear. It 2019s an action of a small and petty man who is intimidated by strong women. 201d Though, notably. When repeatedly pressed, Cruz refused to rule out supporting Trump, who has a lead of 274 pledged delegates, if he becomes the eventual nominee.  The latest exchange is just another example of Trump 2019s small hands tizzy, says Kelly Dittmar, a scholar at Rutgers University 2019s Center for American Women and Politics.  201cInstead of responding to the attack on Melania from the anti-Trump PAC by calling it out for the misogyny it represents, Trump played into the same type of objectification of women by endorsing a response that placed his wife 2019s  2014 and Heidi Cruz 2019s  2014 value in appearance alone, 201d Dittmar said.  201cThis back-and-forth is yet another display of both men seeking to reinforce their masculinity in different ways, whether by  2014 in Trump 2019s case  2014 competing to be the candidate with the hottest wife, or  2014 in Cruz 2019s case  2014 by embodying the role of protector and defender of his family. 201d  Indeed, Cruz  2014 who notably did not call for the Melania ad to be taken down  2014 is no stranger to using his wife as a political prop. When he first announced his candidacy for president, he spent more time talking about Heidi 2019s baking talents than he did her highly successful Goldman Sachs banking career.  Cruz, seeking to burnish his social conservative credentials, buries his wife 2019s success behind her role of mother and supporter, says Michelle Swers, a professor at Georgetown University who studies women in politics.  201cIn this anti-Wall Street climate her association with Goldman Sachs will be questioned, 201d Swers says.  201cAs more women are in the workforce the careers of potential First Ladies will be scrutinized. 201d  A March Reuters Ipsos poll found that half of all women had a  201cvery unfavorable 201d view of Trump, up from 40% in a similar survey conducted in October. And a December Quinnipiac poll found both Trump and Cruz underwater with women in favorable unfavorable standings.  A Republican presidential candidate has not won the women 2019s vote since Ronald Reagan. George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush only won the White House by mitigating the loss of women, who turn out on average 10 percent more than male voters, to the single digits. That gap would likely prove more difficult to close if Hillary Clinton becomes the first female nominee fielded by either party.  Especially if the Republican debate on women is limited to who 2019s prettier and how good a baker one 2019s wife is.  This article was originally published on Time.com.

While the discussion of bonuses remains largely within the team, some riders reportedly received  20ac30,000.  The 12 months between Wiggins' and Froome's victories were defined by the power struggle for the leadership of Team Sky at this year's Tour de France, a battle that ended only when Wiggins was forced to withdraw from the race through injury after pulling out of the Giro d'Italia.  In an extract from Inside Team Sky, Brailsford discussed his  goal harmony  strategy for ensuring that Wiggins would ride in support of Froome in the 2013 race. Banking on Wiggins' professionalism, he expected the defending champion to agree in principle to serve as Froome's domestique.   Then I would say, 'OK, if you don't follow team orders we will agree to fine you three or four months' wages,'  Brailsford told Walsh.  This will be a significant amount of money, maybe as much as a few hundred thousand, and I believed it would concentrate Brad's mind. I was then going to turn to Chris and say: 'Right, Chris, if Brad goes against team orders, I'm going to give you that money.'   The meeting never took place, and the matter of the bonus money was not addressed until the World Championships in Florence, where the British road race team anchored by Froome, and featuring Wiggins, retired in ignominy.   That was a matter for Bradley and Chris and it is now sorted,  Bralisford said of the bonus payment, although Froome's manager and fianc 00e9e Michelle Cound believes issues between the pair are far from resolved.   I don't believe Brad ever intended to pay Chris the bonus,  she told The Times.  I think the reason he did is because he knew it was coming out in the book.   Brad paying Chris really doesn't mean that much. It's about a lot more than the sum of money.

The mystery transportation device being developed by the award-winning inventor Dean Kamen  2014 the subject of continuous fevered speculation since provocative clues and predictions surfaced in media reports last January  2014 is not hydrogen- powered, a favored theory in Internet discussions. Nor does it run on a superefficient Stirling engine (yet).  But if the public's collective yearning for Jetsonian travel technology must remain unrequited this week, at least the speculators will have their curiosity satisfied.  Mr. Kamen plans to demonstrate today a two-wheeled battery-powered device designed for a single standing rider. Its chief novelty lies in the uncanny effect, produced by a finely tuned gyroscopic balancing mechanism, of intuiting where its rider wants to go  2014 and going there.  The device, the Segway Human Transporter, better known by its former code- name, Ginger, can go up to 12 miles an hour and has no brakes. Its speed and direction are controlled solely by the rider's shifting weight and a manual turning mechanism on one of the handlebars.   You might ask, `How does it work?'   said Mr. Kamen, mounting one of the devices last week on a test track at his company's headquarters in Manchester, N.H.  Think forward,  he said, inclining his head ever so slightly and zooming toward a reporter.  Think back,  he continued, effortlessly reversing course.  Tilt sensors monitor the rider's center of gravity more than 100 times a second, signaling to the electric motor and wheels which way to turn and how fast.  Mr. Kamen says the much anticipated unveiling comes now because he has had time to file for crucial patents on the technology and is ready to test it publicly.  The United States Postal Service, the National Park Service and the City of Atlanta plan to begin limited field tests of the devices early next year. Amazon.com ( news quote ) and several companies that make parts for the Segway, including GE Plastics and Michelin North America, plan to use the devices to try to save money by reducing the time it takes employees to move around corporate campuses and large warehouses.  At an average speed of 8 miles an hour, or three times walking pace, Mr. Kamen says the Segway can go 15 miles on a six- hour charge, for less than a dime's worth of electricity from a standard wall socket.  It is easy to see how the transporter tickled technology industry luminaries like Steve Jobs, founder of Apple Computer ( news quote ), and Jeff Bezos, chairman of Amazon.com, when Mr. Kamen showed them an early model of the Segway. John Doerr, a partner in the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, has invested $38 million in Mr. Kamen's efforts, the largest single investment in the firm's history.  The names and positive pronouncements of all three  2014 Mr. Jobs reportedly said the device could be as significant as the development of the personal computer  2014 were invoked in a supposedly secret proposal for a book to be written by Mr. Kamen and Steve Kemper, a journalist. But excerpts of the proposal, which won a $250,000 contract from Harvard Business School Press, were reported in January by Inside .com, which is now defunct.  The leaked proposal, which referred to the Segway cryptically as  It,  set off a tidal wave of conjecture that led to several hundred media reports, tens of thousands of Internet postings and the question in the minds of some observers as to whether Mr. Kamen had set out a deliberate strategy to whip up public interest in his creation.  Mr. Kamen says he was mortified by the leak and that his reason for maintaining his silence in the face of so much speculation was to protect his company's intellectual property as it filed hundreds of patent claims. He suggests the level of interest is a sign of the actual hunger for a transportation choice that fills the niche between walking and driving.  The recipient last year of the National Medal of Technology, awarded by President Bill Clinton, Mr. Kamen,49, has made millions of dollars creating medical devices including the first insulin pump and the first portable kidney dialysis machine.  Typically, Mr. Kamen sticks to research and development with his company, DEKA Research and Development, and licenses his inventions for others to market. But for the Segway, which grew out of his work on a motorized wheelchair that can climb stairs (code-named Fred), Mr. Kamen decided in early 2000 to form his own company to produce and market it.  A college dropout, Mr. Kamen has collected a total of about $90 million for the start-up, Segway, with Credit Suisse First Boston Private Equity and Kleiner Perkins as the lead investors. He retains majority control of the company, whose headquarters are in a complex of former mills about 10 minutes from his hexagonal-shaped home, which has a machine shop in the basement and two helicopters in the garage.  The decision to start the company was based largely on his personal attachment to the idea, Mr. Kamen said. Not one to shrink from sweeping statements, he argues that the Segway could cause cities to be redesigned, help wean the world from oil dependence, compress time and space for pedestrians and raise productivity for corporations and government agencies.   Nothing has happened at the level of the pedestrian to improve transportation since we invented the sneaker,  Mr. Kamen said.  We think if you could integrate the Segway technology into cities it would be a universal win for everybody.   That is a big if. The Segway is meant to be ridden on sidewalks, and many municipalities ban motorized devices on sidewalks. The machines weigh 65 pounds, and although they may be able to zip in and out of elevators and offices, going up and down stairs is a different matter. The device can be put in  follow mode,  which helps propel it up and down, but there is still lifting to be done. Each one comes with a computer encoded on-off key protected by 64- bit software encryption to deter thieves or joyriders. But locking the machine to a parking meter or lamppost is far more awkward than doing the same with a bicycle.  Then there is the price. When the first models are expected to be available to consumers in about a year, they will cost about $3,000.   I don't want to sound like a Ginger-slammer,  said Paul Saffo, director of the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park, Calif.,  but it's about $2,000 too expensive and 40 pounds too heavy.   Even if some consumers are taken with the devices, skeptics say the social resistance to them may pose an even greater problem.   The big question is: Will pedestrians consider them socially acceptable on the sidewalk?  said Sheila Lynch, executive director of the Northeast Advanced Vehicle Consortium, a nonprofit organization that sponsors alternative transportation projects.  I've seen a lot of promising transportation innovations, and a lot of them aren't around anymore. I thought electric bikes would be a no- brainer, and they're not doing so well.   Even though scooters are much cheaper and faster, Mr. Kamen says that the Segway, which riders stand on facing forward, feet side by side, will have much broader appeal than scooters, which require an ability to balance and brave street traffic.  But Gary Bridge, Segway's senior vice president for marketing, is acutely aware of the need to develop a code of  Segway etiquette  before introducing the device to consumers. When Mr. Kamen invited a reporter to play on the Segway, Mr. Bridge reminded him,  We don't play, we ride.    The last thing we want is to be seen as the snowboard,  Mr. Bridge added.  To avoid such associations, the first field tests of the devices are set to take place over the next few months with government agencies and corporations. The United States Postal Service, for instance, plans to try 20 units on mail routes in Concorde, N.H., and Fort Myers, Fla., starting in January. The agency hopes the devices can reduce reliance on trucks and enable mail carriers to cover more ground.  And the City of Atlanta plans to use several dozen starting in February in an effort to reduce emissions and traffic congestion in its downtown area, where many employees drive three or four miles to work.   The idea of being able to extend somebody's willingness to be on foot from a couple of blocks to four miles makes a lot of sense for us,  said Michael Dobbins, commissioner of planning development and neighborhood conservation for the City of Atlanta, who wrote Mr. Kamen a letter after reading a newspaper article about  It  earlier this year.  Ultimately, Mr. Dobbins said, other commuters may want to use the device in conjunction with public transportation.  As for whether the Segway can ever hope to live up to the hype of Ginger and It, innovation experts say it is too soon to tell.   This seems like a machine that wants to serve humans, and maybe that's his real breakthrough,  said Arthur Molella, director of the Lemelson Center for the Study of Invention and Innovation.  But in terms of a conceptual breakthrough, we're going to see it as a breakthrough only if a whole lot of people use it.   t is not a hovercraft, a helicopter backpack or a teleportation pod.

We've been hearing the term 'smart home' for about the last two years, maybe a little less,  said David Siroty, vice president for North American communications at Coldwell Banker.  Technology is intersecting with the home more than at any other time in history.   A study released earlier this year by Coldwell Banker found that about 45 percent of Americans either own some kind of smart home technology or plan to buy it this year. And Siroty said about 33 percent of Coldwell Banker's agents report that properties labeled as  smart  sold more quickly and for higher prices than expected.  With demand for  Internet of things,  or IoT, household devices on the rise and more homeowners incorporating smartphone-controlled features into their properties, industry leaders are working on a definition that everyone can get behind. Coldwell Banker and technology review site CNET teamed up to answer this question by putting together a new smart home litmus test and building a checklist for home buyers and sellers to use to help figure out whether their properties qualify.  Under the new definition, a home must have an Internet connection and at least three different kinds of smart technology to be considered a smart home. At least one of those technologies must be either for security or temperature control, and the others can come from a list of categories CNET and Coldwell Banker established.  One of the most popular smart technologies Coldwell Banker agents are seeing right now are those that enhance home security, Siroty said. According to the Coldwell Banker survey, about 31 percent of people with smart home technology have some form of smart security system.  Smart homes are more common right now in more affluent markets, where the different technologies are built into a customized, integrated system, Siroty said. But individually purchased smart appliances and systems are popping up in homes at lower price points.   It's similar to the explosion we saw in granite countertops,  he said.  They were the norm in the more affluent sector, and over time they came more into traditional homes to the point where they're now standard in many homes.   So what goes in to creating a smart home? Here are eight things Coldwell Banker and CNET say could raise your home's IQ. Summary: How many Internet-connected systems does your home need before it's considered brainy?

The federal government on Wednesday issued a formal request for proposals for the 14-acre campus of the Volpe Transportation Center in Kendall Square, offering up a rare swath of open land in one of the tightest real estate markets on the East Coast. Developers will have 90 days to respond with their plans, and the General Services Administration hopes to award the site to one of them by year 2019s end.  A slew of major Boston-area builders have expressed interest in the Kendall Square site, Cambridge officials said.  A slew of major Boston-area builders have expressed interest in the site, according to Cambridge officials, among them Skanska USA, Boston Properties, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, and the real estate arm of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  The GSA released the RFP only to bidders who qualified in an earlier round of the competition, which included proven ability to finance a $500 million project. It has declined to identify those firms, citing federal procurement laws. It has also refused to publicly release details of the RFP, so it is unclear what priorities the agency will consider.  One requirement the GSA did disclose, however, is that the winning bidder build a  201cstate-of-the-art 201d facility for the Volpe Center itself before taking possession of the rest of the property. That means any large mixed-use development there is likely to be years away.  It 2019s not clear what form that development might take, or how big it could be. Late last year, Cambridge officials halted a plan to rezone the Volpe site for the new project until a developer was selected. The city was considering allowing a building as high as 500 feet, which would be the tallest in Cambridge, along with adopting steep requirements for affordable housing and open space.

            "input": "text:The Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center is about to come under the management of the University of California at Los Angeles. The contract under which the two-year-old museum will give up its independence is expected to be signed in a few weeks, Arthur Groman, the museum's lawyer, said this week.  Joining the museum with U.C.L.A. was, Mr. Groman said,  a marriage made in heaven.    Securing competent management is a hard task and here we have qualified people at hand,  he said.  The museum's $60 million building in the Westwood area of Los Angeles was overseen by Dr. Hammer, the chairman of the Occidental Petroleum Corporation, whose headquarters is adjacent to the museum. At the direction of Dr. Hammer, shortly before his death in 1990, Occidental gave the museum a $35 million endowment in addition to the money to build the museum.  But the corporation's pockets were never quite deep enough: the museum from its inception has had financial and management problems. Accusations and a Lawsuit  When plans for the museum were unveiled in 1988, Dr. Hammer was accused of reneging on his promise to donate his art collection to the Los Angeles County Museum. Then Occidental shareholders unsuccessfully took Dr. Hammer to court, saying the corporation paid $95 million for what was, in fact, a private project. Neither incident proved an obstacle to Dr. Hammer, however, who opened the museum in his name and gave it the bulk of his collection.  There are lingering problems even now. A lawsuit filed two years ago by Joan Weiss, the niece and sole heir of Frances Hammer, Dr. Hammer's wife, who died in December 1989, challenges the museum's ownership of its art collection, which consists of about 100 Old Master, 19th- and 20th-century works, estimated to be worth about $450 million at the market's peak two years ago.   This suit has significant impact on the future of the museum,  said Richard D. Cleary, a lawyer representing Mrs. Weiss, who added that he believes that if his client wins, the museum will be left without much of a collection. (Once the university takes over management of the Hammer, the museum will get some works owned by U.C.L.A., like a Matisse collage, as well as 35,000 works on paper currently at the university's Grunwald Center for the Graphic Arts. But the most important works are from Dr. Hammer's collection.) Compliance or Coercion?  Mrs. Hammer signed several disclaimers waiving her right to the art her husband gave the museum. But Mrs. Weiss charges that her aunt, who died three years ago, was coerced into signing the agreements by Dr. Hammer, depriving his wife of the fair share of her husband's estate. According to court papers, the bulk of Dr. Hammer's fortune, estimated to be $400 million, was from Mrs. Hammer's own assets or was community property, which under California law must be split. A court conference is scheduled for Sept. 24 and a trial date is expected to be set then.  Henry T. Hopkins, the chairman of U.C.L.A.'s art department and director of its Wight Gallery, will be the Hammer Museum's new director. And the Wight Gallery and the Grunwald Center for the Graphic Arts will move into the museum's building in Westwood.  Both gallery spaces will eventually be converted to academic use.  It's a complex negotiation,  said Ruth Simon, a lawyer for the university.  We're hoping all the details will be ironed out soon.   Those now running the Hammer -- Stephen Garrett, the director, and Alla Hall, the administrative curator -- will be leaving at the end of the year. Mr. Garrett said their plans were indefinite. Hilary Gibson, the director of planning and development, left two months ago, and is working with a Westwood business organization. SoHo Square Dance  Last year's spate of artists switching galleries in the hopes of making more money or getting more exposure continues. Indeed, as nearly 50 shows open in SoHo this week, the list of artists who have found new galleries is particularly striking.  Tomorrow, a show of John Coplans self-portraits opens at the Andrea Rosen Gallery, at 130 Prince Street. Mr. Coplans left Galerie Lelong on West 57th Street in June after four years.  The decision had nothing to do with money and there were no quarrels,  said Mr. Coplans.  I'm 72; I'm an old man and I didn't want to be represented by a French gallery that is controlled from Paris. I wanted an American gallery with young people struggling to make new art.  Serrano to Paula the Cooper  A new crop of artists has joined the Paula Cooper Gallery in SoHo this fall, after a rough two years during which it lost three major artists -- Joel Shapiro, Robert Mangold and Donald Judd -- to the Pace Gallery.  The best-known name is Andres Serrano, who will have his first show at Paula Cooper in January. In June, Mr. Serrano sued the Stux Gallery in SoHo, where he had shown for five years, for more than $250,000 he said the gallery owed him from the sale of his works. The artist and the gallery each say the suit was settled amicably, but insiders say that part of the deal included allowing Mr. Serrano to break his contract with Stux.

The day after he died, the broadcast posted excerpts online here and later offered our television audience more here -- but viewers weren't satisfied, so we decided to add to our offerings.  In the clip above, Bowie describes how he approached making albums.  I have such a wide interest in different forms of music,  he said,  I've found that the making of an album really changes from piece to piece.   In 2003, 60 Minutes filmed him recording songs for his album  Reality  in a studio in Woodstock, New York. In one of them,  Never Get Old,  Bowie seems to proclaim his intention to live forever. He assured our producers the song was tongue in cheek.   It doesn't bother me in the slightest, growing older,  he said.  I just thought the subject matter was kind of funny for a song.   By the time 60 Minutes spoke with Bowie, his Ziggy Stardust days were long past. He said he was glad he was no longer doing those types of performances.  I don't miss the spectacle of doing shows like those one iota,  he said.  I would have huge anxiety attacks every night, wondering if somebody is going to fall down, or somebody's going to forget to do something, or whatever.   But Bowie also mentioned his interest in writing a theatrical piece for someone else to perform, which he ultimately did. In 2015,  Lazarus,  starring Michael C. Hall, debuted off-Broadway and sold out within hours.  Bowie's own performances weren't always as confident as they seemed. The first night of a new tour  I'm just jelly, you know?  he told 60 Minutes.  Until I've got that first half hour, say, behind me.   And it wasn't just big shows. Appearing before a small audience of diehard fans in a club called  The Chance  in Poughkeepsie, he told 60 Minutes he was nervous to go on.  It's all new songs, and I've never done them before,  he said.  And this is a tough crowd, believe it or not. This is a really tough crowd.   Interviewed in 2003, Bowie, who lived in downtown New York City, was still processing the events of 9 11.  If I didn't have my family - especially my daughter - whose eyes I do look through a lot these days, I think it would be very easy for me to slip into despondency and negativity about the current times,  he said.  He said his daughter, Alexandria, kept him optimistic.  I owe it to my daughter,  he said.  I want her to know that she has a father who's enthusiastic and looking forward to the things she's going to do when she grows up.    00a9 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

He was 88.  Edhi's family announced his death and his son, Faisal Edhi, asked all people to  pray for the departed soul  of his father.  Earlier in the day, the family had said that Edhi's condition deteriorated and that he was breathing with the help of a ventilator. Edhi had been hospitalized for the past several weeks and his son said he was suffering from kidney- and sugar-related problems.  Known in Pakistan as  Angel of Mercy  for his social work that also won international acclaim, Edhi had established a welfare foundation almost six decades ago that he oversaw together with his wife, Bilquis Edhi.  The foundation owns and runs Pakistan's largest ambulance service, as well as nursing homes, orphanages, clinics and women's shelters, along with rehabilitation centers and soup kitchens across the country.  Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif expressed his condolences and sorrow over Edhi's passing and said he prayed that God will give the charity worker  the best place in paradise.   Edhi was a  real gem and asset for Pakistan,  Sharif said in a statement.  We have lost a great servant of humanity. He was the real manifestation of love for those who were socially vulnerable, impoverished, helpless and poor.    This loss is irreparable for the people of Pakistan,  the prime minister added.  Pakistan's powerful army chief Gen. Raheel Sharif also expressed his condolences to Edhi's family, lauding him as a  true humanitarian.   Crowds of people were gathering outside the Karchi hospital late Friday night to express their condolences to the family.  Edhi came from humble origins and remained a quiet and modest man all his life, which in part was what inspired the nationwide love for him among Pakistanis. His son said that before his death, he asked that his eyes be donated to a person in need.  Born in 1928 in a small village of Bantva near Joona Garh in Gujarat district of then British-ruled India, Edhi was deeply affected by the death of his mother when he was 19. He never finished school but later said that the world of suffering became his tutor.  Edhi migrated to Pakistan in 1947 and made a living at first by working as a commission agent selling cloth at the Karachi wholesale market. A few years later, he started a free Bantva dispensary with the support of some community members. That was the start of his charity work.  In time, he turned his vision of developing a systemized welfare service and drew a persistent and wide response for donations, expanding the trust at a remarkable pace. He first set up a maternity home and the emergency ambulance service in Karachi, which at the time had a population of over 10 million.  In 1965, Edhi married Bilquis Bano, a nurse who worked at the Edhi dispensary. The couple has four children, two daughters and two sons. Bilquis ran the free maternity home and organized adoption of abandoned and out-of-wedlock children across Pakistan.  As their work spread across the country, Edhi remained involved hands-on in the Edhi Foundation, from raising funds to helping with ritual bathing of the bodies of the deceased poor. He also personally drove one of the network's ambulances across Karachi to help anyone in need.  Edhi's foundation also provides technical education to the disadvantaged, religious education for street children, consultations on family planning and maternity services, as well as free legal aid, financial and medical support to prisoners and the handicapped.  Despite the vast sums of money that passed through his foundation, Edhi lived modestly with his family in a two-room apartment adjacent to the headquarters of his foundation.  His work earned him numerous awards at home and abroad, including the Gandhi Peace Award, the 2007 UNESCO Madanjeet Singh Prize, the 2011 London Peace Award, the 2008 Seoul Peace Award and the Hamdan Award for Volunteers in Humanitarian Medical Service.  Known in public as Maulana Edhi - a respectful title for a religious scholar, usually an elderly person with a beard - he supported and promoted working opportunities for women. Out of the 2,000 paid workers of his Edhi Foundation, around 500 are women.  Prime Minister Sharif also announced Saturday as a day of mourning in Pakistan and said Edhi would be given a state funeral on Saturday in recognition for his services.  Sharif, who is returning to Pakistan from London where he underwent open heart surgery, expressed regret that his health would not allow him to personally attend the funeral.

League tables may indicate, for example, that one university is stronger for veterinary science than another. Student satisfaction surveys may show that one institution offers a better experience than another, while employers may even favour graduates from a certain establishment. But the universities that come out on top in all these measures can change from year to year, and when it comes to naming them there may be surprises in store.  In the most recent national Research Assessment Exercise, which ranks universities according to the quality of their research, the University of Essex came ninth in the UK, above Bristol, Leeds, Sheffield and other red-brick institutions.  201cIn social science we were top in the country, so those wanting to study politics, economics or sociology could do well here, 201d says the university 2019s spokesperson Jenny Grinter.  201cIn economics, 100 per cent of our research was internationally recognised. In politics, 45 per cent was world-leading. Those figures eclipse Oxford, Cambridge and some other leading universities. 201d  There are other unsung heroes. Bournemouth University, for example, won a Queen 2019s Anniversary Prize in 2011 for world-leading excellence and pioneering development in computer animation, and has, says Vinney,  201cone of the best media schools in the world 201d. The Complete University Guide 2013 puts Strathclyde fourth in the UK for accounting and finance; Hertfordshire sixth for anatomy and physiology; and the University of Bath second for accounting and finance, third for business studies and fourth for both politics and psychology.  Non-red-bricks thrive in vocational and professional courses, too. Aspiring teachers assemble at Edge Hill University in Lancashire, those seeking careers in sports sprint to Loughborough, and would-be fashion students flock to Central Saint Martins. The University of East Anglia, meanwhile, is known for its creative writing programmes, which have nurtured acclaimed novelists Ian McEwan, Tracy Chevalier and Kazuo Ishiguro.  When it 2019s a question of university life and the student experience, it 2019s a little more difficult to measure quality. Rachel Winzer is director of research at the 1994 Group, which represents 19 UK universities  2014 among them Essex, Bath, Leicester and Surrey. Winzer says their member institutions have  201ca long heritage in providing high-quality student experiences 201d and that the organisation has  201cchampioned the concept of the holistic student experience 201d, which she points to as a key measure of quality. In the 2011 National Student Survey, the University of Cambridge took first place among universities when it came to overall student satisfaction, with Oxford and St Andrews in Scotland  2014 a member of the 1994 Group  2014 among those in joint second place. The 2012 survey released yesterday saw Open University top the rankings.   201cOne of our key selling points is our well-established placement scheme that leads to high employability, 201d says Will Marsh, a spokesman for the University of Bath, which was named Sunday Times University of the Year 2011-12.  The university has strong relationships with leading international organisations, including Nike and Google.  201cMany of our graduates go into jobs earning well above the national average, 201d adds Marsh.  Employability is also a priority for the 20 Russell Group institutions. According to Wendy Piatt, director general of the Russell Group, their graduates are particularly sought after by employers. While UK graduates overall can expect to earn at least  00a3100,000 more during their working lives than their counterparts who do not have degrees,  201cRussell Group graduates receive on average a 10 per cent salary 'top-up 2019 over those from other universities 201d.  But Grinter at the University of Essex says employers know the courses that suit them  2014 and those may not exclusively be from big-name institutions. She advises applicants to dig a little deeper.  201cConsider what you want to study and how strong a particular university is in that subject, rather than just looking for an institution that you recognise. For example, big human rights organisations, such as the United Nations, are full of our graduates. People wanting to work in that field know that going to Essex opens doors. 201d  Marsh says:  201cWe would like to think that employers prick up their ears when they see a degree from Bath on a CV. We have seven students applying for every place here, and while Ucas applications in the country overall have fallen this year, ours have gone up. 201d  The University of Worcester similarly bucks the trend. Applications to this new university have risen at a faster rate than applications to any other UK university over the last five years.  While academic reputation and performance are certainly important, students really need to consider the whole experience before making a decision. Are there top-notch sports facilities and state-of-the-art labs or workshops? Which universities are best for students who want to study part-time? How many contact hours do students get?  How are courses taught and assessed and what 2019s the accommodation like?   201cWe 2019re a campus-based university, on a hillside overlooking Bath, with social and academic facilities all in one place, 201d explains Marsh. He compares this set-up with that of the nearby University of Bristol:  201cIt has buildings spread across the city  2014 the two universities offer very different environments. 201d   201cProspective students should have the freedom to choose which type of university suits them best, 201d Vinney concludes.  201cIt is time for us to challenge this deep-seated notion that one type of university is 'better 2019 than another. The most important question is, which university is the best fit for you? 201d  After getting straight A*s in her A-levels, Lucy chose a marketing degree at Bournemouth University.   201cI considered lots of courses before deciding on marketing. I wanted to do something new and creative. My head of sixth form was keen for me to apply to Oxbridge to study English literature. He said a lot of the London marketing agencies would prefer to hire an Oxbridge graduate, but I didn 2019t want to go into a job feeling I knew an awful lot about books but not a great deal about the business. I think my teachers felt that if I could get in but didn 2019t apply, it was a waste. I don 2019t see it that way.   201cMy parents were supportive of my decision. They were impressed by the relationship Bournemouth has with industry. I 2019m now on my sandwich year, and the university has helped me get a placement doing creative marketing for Warner Bros.   201cWith any course, you get out what you put in. I 2019ve been really pleased with mine. It 2019s vocational, but with bits of economics and psychology, so I haven 2019t had to give up on the academic subjects. I feel I 2019ve definitely made the right decision for me. 201d  University open days: How to make the most of university open days  National student survey: UK student satisfaction reaches new record  University rankings: British universities on the rise Summary: Anyone thinking about higher education in 2013 should take into account more   than surveys and league tables, advises Jessica Moore.",

But then she saw Fred Trump pull up in an elegant black limousine. She put down her groceries and rapped on the limo 2019s tinted window to complain to the real estate royal who owned her building. To her surprise, the elder Trump came out and helped her carry her groceries up five flights of stairs, Andrews says today  2014 and he stayed for coffee.  Forty years later, the daughter is voting for the son.  At a Staten Island fundraiser for the Republican Party of Richmond County on Sunday, Andrews recalls seeing Fred and Donald strolling around her childhood apartment complex, chatting with her mother.   201cHe was just a nice man, 201d Andrews says of Fred Trump.  201cAnd Donald was with him a lot. So I was a fan of them from back then. 201d  Trump has been a national celebrity for decades and his gold-plated name has propelled him to victory in far-flung states from Georgia to Michigan. But as the primary comes to Trump 2019s home state on New York on April 19, there are few places where he is as big a force. In Staten Island, New York City 2019s most isolated borough, where the Trump family 2019s roots run deep, his support is as strong as anywhere in the country.  The locals grew up in his father 2019s buildings, saw him on television, commuted to Manhattan to work in his towers. Trump conjures up the combativeness, the straight-talking bluntness and success prized among New Yorkers, particularly in the heavily Republican borough.  At a press conference at the Hilton Garden Inn fundraiser lunch on Sunday, Trump recalled the days when he drove with his suited father in a limousine around the island.  201cIn the summers I used to work on Staten Island, 201d he said.  201cThe greatest people. These people are incredible people. 201d  If New York City is a microcosm of the national demography, then Staten Island is a holdout of mostly white conservatives in a city that is quickly diversifying. Staten Island went for McCain in 2008, even as the rest of the city voted for Barack Obama. And the borough, a blue collar county with heavy Italian and Irish heritage where the Trumps owned Tysens Park and apartments in Grymes Hill, has long been Trump land.  At the event on Sunday, Staten Island 2019s women in four-inch heels and men in jerseys with  201cTrump 201d written across the back gave him a standing ovation when he arrived, and they didn 2019t sit down for the entire speech.  Trump repeatedly appealed to the concerns of white voters who feel increasingly marginalized as a political minority in New York City, even though they 2019re not a racial one. During the event, he got big cheers for saying we need  201cless political correctness, 201d and accused China of waging an  201ceconomic war 201d against the U.S. And he recast Ted Cruz 2019s now infamous dig at  201cNew York values 201d in his own way.  201cWe 2019re New Yorkers, we 2019re smart, 201d he said matter-of-factly.  201cWe have New York values. 201d  The family real estate empire was largely built by his father Fred in the post-World War II building boom and included low-to-middle-income housing across the boroughs, some of it built with government assistance. The family faced repeated allegations of racial discrimination and was sued by the federal government in 1973 for refusing to lease apartments to African Americans.  Shelomo Alfassa saw the Trump developments growing up near Coney Island in Brooklyn and still sees the Trump Pavilion developments in Jamaica, Queens, on his commute to work.  201cI lived right near Coney Island. I grew up hearing the name Trump, 201d said Alfassa, the director of marketing at a security company.  Because Trump is both a national celebrity and a local businessman, everyone who 2019s crossed his path has a story to tell. Donald Pagano, a Staten Island-based contractor, said he worked a job in the Trump Tower on 57th Street and Fifth Avenue as a 23-year-old and once rode an elevator with Ivana Trump. He didn 2019t recognize her as Trump 2019s wife, so he started flirting with her.   201cI said,  2018You have the most beautiful blue eyes, enveloping bigger than the Pacific Ocean, 2019 something like that, 201d Pagano said, laughing.  201cSo I always like to refer to myself as  2018the other Donald 2019 in her life. 201d  Despite his name recognition, Trump is as controversial in Staten Island as he is anywhere else. The protesters outside his Sunday event carrying anti-Trump signs called him a fascist and a racist.  201cIf greed and avarice and chicanery are New York values, then yes, 201d Trump is a New Yorker, said Pete McParland, who works in maintenance at the College of Staten Island.  201cUnfortunately, it 2019s a very racist borough. 201d  It helps that in a city that is grappling with racial tensions over police brutality, Staten Island is cop country. On Sunday, Trump accepted an award from the New York Veteran Police Association and told a group of retired NYPD officers he had a  201ctremendous amount of respect for the work you do. 201d   201cHe understands and is sensitive to how tough our job is, 201d says Lou Telano, president of the New York Veteran Police Association, who says he has spoken with Trump several times on this issue. Telano presented Trump with an award for his  201cdedication, concern and support for America 2019s law enforcement. 201d  With Trump looming larger than life over Staten Island, Democrats have come to contest his popularity.  201cDonald Trump was here today but he certainly wasn 2019t welcome in my part of Staten Island, 201d New York State Assembly Member Matt Titone said at a Hillary Clinton event later that day.  201cWe have to show the world what Staten Island truly is about. And we are about inclusion. 201d  Yet perhaps more on Staten Island than anywhere else, Trump is still a byword for success.   201cAll of the stuff Trump had going on in the  201980s. The hotel. The board game. The football. He 2019s synonymous with wealth, 201d said Richard Luthman, a Staten Island man who is registered as a Democrat but plans to write Trump in.  201cTrump is New York. 201d  Luthman was one of several registered Democrats in the audience who had chosen Trump over their party 2019s candidates.  201cI don 2019t like any of the Democrats running, 201d says Angela Gianino, a second-grade teacher and registered Democrat.  201cFrom the very first day when they threw his name out there, I thought he would be a great President. 201d  Her sister Jacqueline Allen, a pediatric nurse practitioner, put it this way:  201cEverything he touches turns to gold. 201d  Yet despite his family 2019s history in the borough, Trump rarely crosses the Verrazano Bridge to this part of the city. When he was asked by a reporter what his favorite pizzeria in Staten Island is, he was decidedly vague.   201cI have a lot of them, 201d Trump said.  201cI have, like, 12. 201d  Correction: The original version of this story misstated the 2012 presidential election results in Staten Island. President Obama beat Mitt Romney there. Summary: His family 2019s roots run deep in the borough.",

            "input": "text:Yet in the aftermath of Melania Trump 2019s speech, campaign advisers have fretted that they do not know for sure where Mr. Trump gets his ideas and language  2014 whether they are his own, in other words, or are picked up from Twitter, television, or, say, a best seller by Bill O 2019Reilly of Fox News, a commentator whom Mr. Trump likes.  Borrowing or adapting may not always be tantamount to plagiarism, but several Trump advisers, who also insisted on anonymity, said that after the furor over Ms. Trump 2019s remarks, the campaign cannot allow a similar blowup.  Ed Rollins, a Republican strategist who is advising a  201csuper PAC 201d supporting Mr. Trump, said that the candidate could not afford any mistakes.   201cHis speech is the whole game, 201d Mr. Rollins said.  201cViewers have to watch it and say,  2018There is the next president of the United States. 2019 201d  In the interview, Mr. Trump said his speech would center on his vision of a strong and secure America that  201conce existed and no longer does, but can again under a Trump administration. 201d  His greatest challenge, he said, was  201cputting myself in the speech 201d  2014 discussing his upbringing and early experiences and relating them to the hopes and aspirations of other Americans.   201cI was never comfortable getting personal about my family because I thought it was special territory, 201d Mr. Trump said, glancing at a picture of his father on his desk.  201cIt can feel exploitative to use family stories to win votes. And I had a very happy and comfortable life growing up. I had a great relationship with my father. But my focus needs to be on all the Americans who are struggling. 201d  He said he was unsure if he would discuss his older brother Fred, who died as an alcoholic in 1981 at 43  2014 and whom he has described as an example of how destructive choices can damage lives that seem golden.   201cWithout my brother Fred I might not be here, 201d Mr. Trump said.  201cHe was really smart, great-looking. I don 2019t drink or smoke because of what happened to him. I focused on building my business and making good choices. I may talk about that, but I don 2019t know if I should. 201d  Acceptance speeches seldom seem complete without anecdotes about personal trials and triumphs: Mitt Romney, trying to persuade voters to see him as more than a rich businessman, devoted about a fourth of his 2012 address to his parents 2019 unconditional love, his Mormon faith and reminiscences about watching the moon landing. In 2008, Barack Obama described how his grandfather benefited from the G.I. Bill and how his mother and grandmother taught him the value of hard work. And Bill Clinton 2019s 1992 speech vividly recalled the life lessons he learned from his mother about fighting and working hard, from his grandfather about racial equality  2014 and from his wife, Hillary, who, Mr. Clinton said, taught him that every child could learn.  Mr. Clinton finished his speech with a now-famous line tying his Arkansas hometown to the American dream.  201cI end tonight where it all began for me, 201d he said.  201cI still believe in a place called Hope. 201d  James Carville, a senior strategist for Mr. Clinton 2019s 1992 campaign, said that if Mr. Trump hoped to change the minds of those who see him as divisive or bigoted, he would need to open himself up to voters in meaningfully personal ways in his speech.   201cIf he 2019s really different than the way he seems in television interviews or at his rallies, Thursday 2019s speech will be his single greatest opportunity to show voters who he really is, 201d Mr. Carville said.  Paul Manafort, the Trump campaign chairman, said that Thursday 2019s speech would be  201cvery much a reflection of Mr. Trump 2019s own words, as opposed to remarks that others create and the campaign puts in his mouth. 201d   201cHe 2019s not an editor  2014 he is actually the creator of the speech, 201d Mr. Manafort said.  201cMr. Trump has given Steve Miller and I very specific directions about how he views the speech, what he wants to communicate, and ways to tie together things that he has been talking about in the campaign. The speech will end up being tone-perfect because the speech 2019s words will be his words. 201d  Mr. Trump prefers speaking off the cuff with handwritten notes, a style that has proved successful at his rallies, where he has shown a talent for connecting with and electrifying crowds. But his adjustment to formal speeches remains a work in progress: He does not always sound like himself, and reading from a text can detract from the sense of authenticity that his supporters prize.  One question is whether, or how much, he will ad-lib.  He has sometimes seemed unable to resist deviating from prepared remarks, often to ill effect  2014 ranting about a mosquito, or joking that a passing airplane was from Mexico and was  201cgetting ready to attack. 201d   201cAd-libbing is instinct, all instinct, 201d Mr. Trump said.  201cI thought maybe about doing a freewheeling speech for the convention, but that really wouldn 2019t work. But even with a teleprompter, the speech will be me  2014 my ideas, my beliefs, my words. 201d Summary: Mr. Trump 2019s campaign is said to have given orders that any language in his speech even loosely inspired by essays, books or Twitter posts must be rewritten or attributed.",

            "input": "text:Bad news for men popped up in news media all over the country this week, based on a study from Northwestern University reporting that cases of advanced, aggressive prostate cancer had risen sharply from 2004 to 2013.  Newsweek, NBC, CBS, Fox News and United Press International were among the organizations that covered the study. The reports suggested that recent medical advice against routine screening might be to blame for the apparent increase in advanced cases, by leading to delays in diagnosis until the cancer reached a late stage. Another factor cited was the possibility that prostate cancer had somehow become more aggressive.  But the frightening news appears to be a false alarm  2014 the product of a study questioned by other researchers but promoted with an incendiary news release and initially reported by some news media with little or no analysis from outside experts.  The claim of an increase in advanced cases does not hold up, according to the American Cancer Society, which posted a statement on its website challenging the findings. The main concern is that the study 2019s methods do not pass muster with statistics experts, so the increase may not be real.  In an interview, the cancer society 2019s chief medical officer, Dr. Otis W. Brawley, called the study  201cmisguided epidemiology 201d and said its authors  201cdon 2019t know that they don 2019t know. 201d  The episode began late last week when Northwestern University emailed an attention-grabbing news release to reporters.  201cMetastatic Prostate Cancer Cases Skyrocket, 201d it said, and described a study published Tuesday in the journal Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases.  The study 2019s authors wrote that routine use of blood tests to screen for prostate cancer had declined, and that they wanted to find out if the decline had led to changes in the incidence of advanced disease at the time of diagnosis.  Prostate screening has long been a subject of intense debate, with advocates insisting it saves lives and detractors saying it leads to too much unnecessary treatment of tumors that would never have progressed. The operation can leave men incontinent and impotent. In recent years, expert groups have advised against routine screening, saying the risks outweigh the benefits. But some doctors worry that the drop in screening will leave some men with disease that is found too late to be easily cured.  The senior author of the study, Dr. Edward Schaeffer, a prostate cancer oncologist and the chairman of urology at Northwestern, said in an interview that he believed screening saved lives.  In the study, the doctors examined the records of 767,550 men with prostate cancer diagnosed from 2004 to 2013. Using the number of cases of metastatic disease in 2004 (1,685) and 2013 (2,890), they reported an alarming increase of 72 percent.  But for the United States population, that percentage could be meaningless. On the cancer society website, Dr. Brawley said that to measure whether a disease was becoming more common, researchers could not rely on just the absolute number of cases. They need to calculate rates, meaning the number of cases per a certain number of people.   201cEpidemiologists learned long ago that you can 2019t simply look at raw numbers, 201d he wrote.  201cA rising number of cases can be due simply to a growing and aging population among other factors. 201d  Another expert expressed similar doubts. Dr. Christopher Filson, an assistant professor of urology at Emory University School of Medicine, said:  201cI don 2019t want to claim their results are wrong. They may be true, but the way they looked at the question brings in too many possible alternative explanations. 201d  The authors acknowledged in their report that the lack of rates was a  201climitation. 201d But they said that because the number of patients was large, their findings probably reflected national patterns.  Dr. Schaeffer emphasized that the researchers did not claim a link between their findings and the advisories against screening; they noted that advanced cases started rising even before those.  Most of the initial news articles about the study reported the supposed increase without caveats, and few quoted the cancer society or outside experts. In some cases, online versions of the articles were amended to tone down the message and add comments from Dr. Brawley.  Maggie Fox, a reporter for NBC, said she reported on the study because  201cprostate cancer is a huge issue in this country, and the question of screening has been greatly controversial. 201d Dr. Schaeffer, she said, is influential.  201cWhat he says will make waves, and we felt it was important to report and include criticism of the study. 201d  Dr. Brawley said that even if further analysis found an increase in advanced cases, it would probably be from improvements in magnetic resonance imaging scanning. In other words, rather than reflecting more cases of advanced disease, the increase would mean doctors had become better at finding it.

The iconic theatre was established to resuscitate the artistic and cultural life that Beirut was famous for before the war.  Now, 20 years later, Beirut is going through a different set of changes, led by unfettered real-estate giants ripping down the city 00e2 0080 0099s historical landmarks. Public spaces have been privatised, and Starbucks, McDonalds and other Western food chains have sprung up across the city.  Amid this rapid change, Masrah Beirut (Beirut Theatre), one of the oldest theatres in the capital, closed its doors last year - despite popular protests to keep it open - after the building was sold to a real-estate developer. Now, al-Madina Theatre is one of only three theatres left in Lebanon to offer non-commercial, artistic events.   We are a cultural theatre. We only host works that are based on artistic cultural expressions,  said Louay Ramadan,39, who has managed the theatre since it was first established by artist Nidal Achkar in 1994. Speaking to Al Jazeera from his office, as artists arrived to start rehearsing for a dance show, Ramadan explained that by avoiding commercial shows, which generally bring in the most money, the theatre struggles to stay afloat financially.   Three quarters of the Lebanese audience today look merely for entertainment at commercial shows and perhaps a quarter of people still look for cultural venues to attend; the latter are our bloodline that keeps us busy,  Ramadan said.  RELATED: Baalbeck - Lebanon's show must go on  Facing financial troubles, and without any subsidies from the Lebanese government, al-Madina Theatre turned into al-Madina Theatre Association for Arts and Culture in March of 2005. As a non-profit organisation, the theatre receives private and institutional donations from Lebanon and across the Arab World  The theatre aims to promote dialogue and create a space of free expression. In addition to plays and performances, al-Madina Theatre organises festivals, exhibitions and film screenings, and hosts cultural events such as conferences, seminars, lectures, book signings and workshops.  The main problem in Lebanon for theatres is that they cannot sponsor an event or cater for events that won 00e2 0080 0099t have a financial turnover.  - Roy Dib, Lebanese artist and art critic  Roy Dib is a Lebanese artist and art critic, whose work focuses on the subjective construction of space. The 30-year-old told Al Jazeera that while al-Madina theatre is trying to appeal to young artists and broach new ideas, the steep cost of renting theatre space remains a problem.  While there is no fixed rate, Ramadan told Al Jazeera that al-Madina charges artists between $600 and $800 to use the theatre as a rehearsal space, while rental costs can go up to $2,000 on performance days. He added that the theatre sometimes offers its space up for free when artists cannot afford to pay.   The main problem in Lebanon for theatres is that they cannot sponsor an event or cater for events that won 00e2 0080 0099t have a financial turnover. In the absence of a budget to cover logistics, this kind of theatre work becomes stagnant,  Dib said.  Al-Madina originally began in a smaller space, known as Metro al-Madina. Today, the smaller theatre is an extension of al-Madina and is under different management.  Hip-hop artist El-Rass will launch his second album,  Adam, Darwin and the Penguin  at Metro al-Madina on May 24.  I think Metro al-Madina is a much-needed kind of place in Lebanon,  El-Rass told Al Jazeera,  [for] its mantra of pushing new forms of art, its size that allows both sophisticated performances and affordable prices for artists and audience with a cozy feel.   Lina Sahab, an artist who performs in the cabaret show Hishik Bishik at Metro al-Madina, said the theatre provides  a space to express and perform alternative shows and concerts for an audience that has been long denied such a venue .   Metro al-Madina brought back that spirit and art, and the more we performed our Hishik Bishik show, the more we realised our audience was growing and liking what they watched,  she said.  VIDEO: Walls that speak in Beirut  Throughout modern Lebanese history, theatres have served as a hub for political events. Theatres across the capital hosted politically active Lebanese artists, like Ziad al-Rahbani. They also helped resurrect Lebanon 00e2 0080 0099s Hakawati (storyteller) tradition through the works of artists like Roger Assaf, who produced shows on the heroism of Fedayeen (literally,  those who sacrifice , a reference to Palestinian fighters) and their resistance to the Israeli occupation.  Clashes also broke out during the Lebanese civil war in front of Beirut Theatre, which sits in the waterfront area of Ain al-Mraisy.  Our theatre brings together people from all sects, from all regions in Lebanon, and [from all] political views and colours.  - Louay Ramadan, al-Madina theatre  Dib told Al Jazeera about an incident that occurred in April 1969 at the Beirut Theatre that cemented the theatre 00e2 0080 0099s influential role in Lebanese politics: That night, Dib said, Lebanese security services interrupted a play, Majdaloun, while the actors were still onstage.   The actors decided to continue the play in the street and resumed acting, walking with their audience up to Hamra Street 00e2 0080 00a6 Actors then clashed with the police one more time, finally stopping the play and ending in their arrest,  he recalled.  Issam Bou Khaled - a director, scriptwriter, actor and expert on theatre in Lebanon - told Al Jazeera that in the 1970s and 80s, theatre was more interactive with its audience, many of whom were working-class Lebanese who wanted theatre to reflect the political issues of the time.   Back then, there was the influence of the Palestinian revolution, the Left and the movements of unions and workers' syndicates. Then, Masrah Beirut presented artistic expressions that reflected concerns on the streets. People used to look forward for that interactive theatre,  he said.   The artists and audience found each,  Bou Khaled added,  and that kind of theatre was a mediator [for] interacting and influencing.   According to Ramadan, al-Madina Theatre continues to serve as a centre for culture and political expression.  The theatre became a platform for various expressions, some calling for change in the political situation, and others advocating issues that concern society,  he said.  Our theatre brings together people from all sects, from all regions in Lebanon, and [from all] political views and colours.   Outside the theatre, in Beirut 00e2 0080 0099s traffic-filled Hamra street, Mahmoud, who runs a newsstand next to al-Madina and did not give Al Jazeera his last name, agreed.   This theatre represents a time when Beirut shone its cultural values on the world,  Mahmoud said.  Today Beirut is full of clothing shops and shopping malls. The moment theatres like al-Madina cease to exist, is the moment Beirut 00e2 0080 0099s cultural image is erased.  Summary: Facing gentrification and financial struggles, al-Madina Theatre is one of Lebanon's last non-commercial art spaces.",

Lucy Stephens   There was no understanding of heart failure or the ability to pick up on significant signs from the patient such as her inability to speak.   The inquest heard that Mrs Walters called 111 at around 8am on December 28,2014, asking for a doctor to visit her, and told staff she had a heart defect.  The call handler noticed her breathlessness and classified her case as an emergency, calling 999 to ask for an ambulance to be sent.  A crew was dispatched from Portsmouth's Queen Alexandra Hospital to her home in the city.  But as the paramedics were on their way, Mr Richardson called Mrs Walters back and then cancelled the ambulance when it was just a minute away.   2022 Health watchdog launches inspection of scandal-hit NHS 111 helpline  Mrs Walters' body was found at 6pm, almost ten hours later, by her son, Lawrence Thorpe, a 25-year-old former teacher, who had been resting upstairs in his room that day.  Ann Walters' children, Felicity Thorpe (25) and Lawrence Thorpe (24) Photo: Portsmouth News Solent News & Photo Agency  He dialled 999 but medics who turned up pronounced Mrs Walters dead.  Mr Richardson told Portsmouth Coroner's Court:  During my conversation with her I had established she was conscious and breathing, and expressed a wish to be seen by a doctor and not an ambulance.   I gave her advice that if her symptoms changed or got worse or if there were any concerns in the meantime to call us back straight away on 999.   He told how Mrs Walters refused to wake her son up, adding:  I heard she wanted to be seen by a doctor. I thought I was complying with her wishes.   It was extremely busy that morning.   Mr Thorpe asked:  In hindsight, do you believe your decision was wrong?   The inquest heard calls to the out of hours GP service were up 30 per cent on the previous year for the four-day bank holiday Christmas weekend.  Mrs Walters had declined an operation in 2007 as she was  adamant  she did not want her chest opened up, doctors told the inquest, even though her condition would leave her breathless and more tired.  Consultant Cardiologist Dr Philip Strike of Queen Alexandra Hospital said:  She was aware this would kill her.   When he last saw her shortly before her death in 2014, he gave her less than a year to live, adding:  She was at a phenomenally high risk of sudden death. It could have happened at any point.   Dr Strike said it would have  unlikely  that an ambulance attending her home or an out of hours GP could have saved her if she ultimately died from heart failure.  Senior Coroner David Horsley recorded a narrative verdict, ruling that Mrs Walters died of congestive cardiac failure.  He said there was a  strong possibility' that she died between her phone call with Mr Richardson and a call from the out-of-hours GP an hour later.   Luci Stephens, of South Central Ambulance Service, which runs the local 111 line, said:  We would like to say how sorry we are. The trust has undertaken an extensive investigation in consultation with the family, and has introduced stringent changes to its 999 clinical support desk procedures.   What is the NHS 111?

So how do we begin to comprehend a hundred rows of data, let alone a thousand or a million or a billion rows?  That's the dilemma so many companies face, thanks to technology advances that make it easier to routinely collect enormous amounts of data.  Humans are fundamentally different from computers 2014we're wired to comprehend shapes, patterns and colors. So technology companies are using data visualization to help companies turn large sets of data into pictures that lead people intuitively to the information that is most important to them.  That can mean something as familiar as a color-coded map, only with lots of interactive features. Or it can mean something unfamiliar to most people, like seemingly amorphous shapes that on closer inspection quickly yield insights into the data they portray.  One picture that's still considered effective was published in 1869 by the Frenchman Charles Minard (http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki File:Minard.png). It shows the casualties suffered by the French army during Napoleon's disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812 and 1813.  By using two colored lines 2014one for the army's advance and one for its retreat 2014and varying their thickness as the army's position and its numbers changed, Mr. Minard showed how many men advanced into Russia and how many returned at various locations. A third graph shows the freezing winter temperatures the men encountered as they retreated to France.  Today, Mr. Minard's picture wouldn't be static. We would be able to dig into it, clicking to find out how many men died on a given day and perhaps correlate those numbers with other data, such as the amount of food available or the types of weapons used. We would have more ways to visualize the data 2014we could lay it against a map 2014and we could monitor the reaction to it on Twitter.  Below are some examples of what technology companies are doing today to show us big data in pictures.  This picture combines social-media data with information from a retailer's billing systems to evaluate a marketing campaign. It compares public response to the campaign with the revenue the campaign generated. Horizontal bar charts are an easy way to compare two metrics, such as positive and negative sentiment, says GoodData Corp. Vice President Hubert Palan. (Since this is a U.S. retailer, negative sentiment is in red. If it were an Asian retailer, red would be considered positive.) The bubble chart combines three metrics 2014reach, engagement and return on investment. The verdict: Social-media reaction was good, but return on investment wasn't, so this campaign didn't perform as well as others.  The shapes that Ayasdi Inc. data displays take are automatically generated by the company's software, which relies on a branch of mathematics called topology. This picture shows clusters of credit-card transactions; the red dots indicate fraud. By clicking on the areas that are red, users can get more information on how those frauds were perpetrated. That can help them develop ways to prevent further incidents, say by adding new rules to their transaction systems. Users can choose the colors, but the default color scale runs from blue to red 2014cool to hot 2014says Ayasdi Vice President Jeff Yoshimura.  This series of pictures tells the story of a company's profitability through commonly understood shapes and graphs. Numbers about employees, for instance, are represented by human figures. Numbers about products break down into shopping bags 2014the bigger the bag, the more profitable the product. Tidemark runs on iPads, and since its data is in the cloud the story can be shared and continually refreshed,  much like Facebook and LinkedIn on the consumer side,  says Tidemark Systems Inc. founder and Chief Executive Christian Gheorghe.  This picture represents more than 100 million rows of data. It shows a calculation of how fluid would move through a two-dimensional space; the colors indicate the fluid's density at given points in time. Users can zoom in to examine parts of the picture and the data behind them. This picture was rendered from the data in a couple of seconds, says Pete Schlampp, Platfora Inc. vice president of products and business development.  This picture shows the global rate of infant mortality from 1950 to 2011. The world map orients viewers by geography, while the line graphs orient them by time. Shades of red draw attention to the regions where the most babies have died. The bar chart is another way to compare the number of deaths in each region. It's gray because too much color can be confusing, says Tableau's senior director of product marketing, Ellie Fields.  This is a portrayal of a corporate hierarchy, or pecking order, and infighting based on an investigation of a corporate fraud or insider threat.

Cities across Europe have been touting their financial infrastructure, office space and tech savvy. But for executives considering a move to Frankfurt, Paris, Dublin or Amsterdam, factors such as language and schooling options may matter more.   201cPeople won 2019t accept an assignment if they think it would hurt their children 2019s education, if the infrastructure isn 2019t there, 201d said Simon Murray, director of the International School of Paris, which has  201creceived some exploratory nibbles 201d from British-based families worried about Brexit.  There are just over 775,000 students attending English-language international schools in kindergarten through 12th grade throughout Europe, according to the International School Consultancy, which tracks the international schools market.  James Wykes, a British former banker who moved to Frankfurt with his family in 2014, said families with children enrolled in London 2019s competitive high-end schools may hesitate to remove them if the education abroad won 2019t prepare them for a potential return later.   201cThey 2019ll be concerned how easy it will be to get back in, 201d Mr. Wykes said.  Compounding the problem, many of Europe 2019s top English-language schools say they are full. Paris has many international schools and bilingual programs, but capacity at most of those schools is tight and government efforts to meet demand wouldn 2019t match a post-Brexit surge, say locals.  French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said shortly after the June 23 Brexit vote that France would build as many bilingual classes as needed.  Frankfurt, which is touting itself as a finance center and the home of the European Central Bank, has even fewer international schools, some with waiting lists.   201cShould there be an influx, it will be tight, 201d said Daniela Wuestenberg, who helps families relocate to Frankfurt.  Germany 2019s financial capital has four international schools and one funded by the EU for children of staff. The city also has several bilingual private schools. All are in high demand from foreign and local families.   201cIn terms of capacity, we 2019re at our limit, 201d said Ferdinand Patscheider, the director of the EU 2019s European School Frankfurt.  The EU 2019s London-based European Banking Authority will probably relocate, but to where is undecided. If Frankfurt succeeds in its lobbying to land the EBA,  201cwe 2019ll just about manage to accept the children of those employees, 201d said Mr. Patscheider.  201cThen we 2019re full. 201d  Relocation specialists say that the independent Frankfurt International School and International School Frankfurt Rhein-Main would probably be most appealing to families moving from Britain.  FIS, which was founded in 1961 and helped create the widely recognized International Baccalaureate program, has several hundred students on its waiting list, said Director Paul M. Fochtman. The school 2019s main campus, in a Frankfurt suburb, is full, but  201csolutions can be found 201d if Brexit increases demand, he said.  New schools have more room. The Metropolitan School Frankfurt, established in 2007  201ccan accept 100 more students tomorrow, 201d director Peter Ferres, the school 2019s founder and a former investment banker, said.  Mr. Wykes, the Briton in Frankfurt, said he is happy with the private school his three children attend and the region offers  201ca good quality of life. 201d Still, he questions whether the city can compete with London and Paris on lifestyle and schooling options.  201cIt 2019s a different caliber, 201d he said.  Greater Paris boasts more than a dozen international schools and bilingual programs, spanning preschool to high school, educating thousands of children. Many of those schools, concentrated in its wealthy western suburbs, are already in high demand from both expat and French families.   201cI couldn 2019t even have 10 families at the moment, there just wouldn 2019t be enough space for everyone, 201d said Katarina Pekkanen, Head of Admissions at Sections Internationales de S 00e8vres, a school west of Paris with about 900 students in its English-language section.  An influx of thousands of new students could force some schools to expand, said Kate des Places, external-relations director at Marymount International School, an English-language Catholic school in the affluent suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine. The school plans to address the impact of a Brexit in its new strategic plan this fall, she said.  For Londoners looking abroad who don 2019t want to deal with a foreign language, Dublin is an obvious choice. But the Irish capital presents other schooling issues.  The majority of Irish schools are Catholic and relocation companies say most expat families prefer nonreligious or multidenominational education. Many expat families have focused on a narrow range of multidenominational schools, such as Sutton Park School or St. Andrew 2019s College, increasing competition for admissions.   201cIt 2019s not easy to get a place in those schools, 201d said Francine O 2019Byrne of the Relocation Bureau in Dublin.  201cSometimes, parents 2019 first [choice] isn 2019t possible and we must look at other options. 201d  Amsterdam, home to about 2,700 international companies, is in a particularly difficult spot, relocation specialists say. The city has been drawing an increasing number of companies, resulting in enormous demand for international or bilingual education.   201cThe companies are annoyed that there are no places in the schools, 201d said Eline Hausel of the Young Expat School, a company specialized in helping families relocate to the Netherlands.  The greater Amsterdam area has eight public and private international schools, but those in or near the city center have waiting lists, said Kajsa Ollongren, deputy mayor of Amsterdam.  Amsterdam has responded to the problem with a program to expand capacity over coming years.

            "input": "text:A pair of legal scholars, John McGinnis of Northwestern University (here and here) and Ilya Somin of George Mason University (here and here), have been carrying on a spirited debate as to which would be worse from the standpoint of what is commonly called conservative jurisprudence, a Donald Trump presidency or a Hillary Clinton one. (McGinnis describes himself as a classical liberal, and Somin is affiliated with the libertarian Cato Institute. But both are exponents of conservative jurisprudence, a rough shorthand that serves the purpose for this discussion.)  It 2019s a somewhat peculiar debate, in part because the answer seems like a no-brainer, notwithstanding Trump 2019s manifest lack of knowledge about, and interest in, jurisprudence (beyond cases to which he is a party). McGinnis:  Mrs. Clinton, by contrast, would nominate reliable liberal justices, just as Bill Clinton and Barack Obama both did:  To the list of potential vacancies we would add the seat of Justice Stephen Breyer, whose ninth decade will begin during the next presidential term.  If Mrs. Clinton appoints three justices 2014or she and Obama do so together, since a lame-duck confirmation of Judge Merrick Garland is a possibility should she be elected 2014the result would be not only a liberal majority but, in all likelihood, a young liberal majority. Garland, who will be 69 as of Inauguration Day 2021, would almost certainly be the oldest of the group.  That Trump would be not just less than ideal but worse in this regard strikes us as the sort of idea so absurd only an intellectual could believe it. Somin is such an intellectual. Yet his arguments are worth taking seriously, if only because they expose a fundamental flaw in the entire Nevertrump line of reasoning.  Somin 2019s case begins with the premise, undoubtedly correct, that Trump is not an ideological conservative in the mold of Reagan 2014and further, that unlike other recent GOP nominees, who 2019ve had their heterodoxies, he aims to change the party 2019s ideological orientation in fundamental ways:  This characterization seems to us overwrought in some respects, but let 2019s concede the basic point that Trump is ideologically something new under the Republican sun. Somin argues that even if President Trump appoints some old-fashioned conservative justices, the party 2019s ideological reorientation would, in the long run, have a deleterious jurisprudential effect:  Somin acknowledges that  201cwe don 2019t yet know what the full contours of a Trumpist judicial philosophy might be 201d 2014no small understatement. He then offers some speculations as to what they could look like, about which it suffices to say we are with him in finding the picture he paints unattractive.  We do not fault Somin for taking the long view here, or for considering the worst-case scenario. But here is the problem: When it comes to evaluating the possible consequences of a Trump defeat at Mrs. Clinton 2019s hands, he acts as if the world ends in 2021. That short time horizon is convenient for his argument but potentially disastrous for his objective.  Example: He opines that McGinnis  201cmay . . . be excessively pessimistic in thinking that [Mrs.] Clinton would get two or even three Supreme Court appointments, if she wins. 201d He acknowledges that Antonin Scalia isn 2019t coming back, but he scoffs at the idea that Ruth Bader Ginsburg would retire 2014after all, she hasn 2019t done so before. Seriously, that 2019s his argument:  He also doesn 2019t think Justice Kennedy would voluntarily leave the bench during a Democratic presidency. But then neither, one supposes, would Scalia have. At some point every justice departs, whether voluntarily or not.  If Mrs. Clinton is elected and re-elected, then by the end of her time in office Ginsburg would be 91, Kennedy 88 and Breyer 86. The likelihood of a youthful (by Supreme Court standards) and therefore enduring six-justice liberal majority seems perilously high.  It is true that conceding the 2016 election to Mrs. Clinton, as the Nevertrumplings urge, would not ensure her re-election four years later. But it would open the possibility 2014a possibility we have not seen seriously addressed in any of the voluminous Nevertrump literature we 2019ve reviewed. The plan seems to be along the lines of the Underpants Gnomes of  201cSouth Park 201d: 1. Throw the 2016 election; 2. ?; 3. Conservative victory in 2020!  Electoral politics beyond 2016 lies beyond the scope of Somin 2019s argument but is highly relevant to it nonetheless. What makes Nevertrump conservatives so confident in their ability to win in 2020? We 2019d venture to say it 2019s more a matter of complacency than confidence.   201cMovement conservatism 201d of the Goldwater-Reagan variety has been the Republican Party 2019s dominant ideology since about 1980. Even presidential nominees with doubtful conservative bona fides, from George H.W. Bush in 1988 through Mitt Romney in 2012, were sufficiently beholden that conservatives found it easy to put aside their doubts and vote for them. Again, in this regard Trump is a departure.  But in the past quarter-century Republicans have had little success in presidential elections. In only one of the past six, in 2004, did the GOP nominee receive a majority of the popular vote. George W. Bush of course also won the tie election in 2000, though he might not have if the U.S. Supreme Court had declined to intervene (at some institutional cost) to stop the Florida Supreme Court 2019s effort to steal the election for Al Gore.  Republicans won seven of the 11 presidential elections during the Cold War (1948-88). Since the Cold War ended, they 2019ve won only two of six, and the only decisive victory came at a time when the country was on a war footing. Not since 1928 has a Republican won a majority of the popular vote in the absence of war, hot or cold. It is a reasonable hypothesis that the modern Republican Party 2014which for decades has meant the  201cconservative 201d party 2014is at a natural disadvantage, which it overcame in earlier decades (and in 2004) only through superior leadership in the international arena.  If that is true, why would one expect a traditional conservative nominee to beat Mrs. Clinton in 2020? Perhaps she would pursue a feckless foreign policy,  00e0 la Lyndon Johnson or Jimmy Carter, restoring the Republicans 2019  201cwar 201d advantage. Maybe the Bernie Sanders insurgency portends a fracturing of the Democratic coalition, creating an opportunity for the GOP. Other things could go wrong for Mrs. Clinton. But it seems foolish simply to bet on disaster.  Somin worries, not without reason, about what will happen  201cif Trump wins the election and manages to recast the GOP in his image 201d:  201cA president who is perceived as politically successful usually has a substantial impact on his party 2019s agenda, as other politicians will seek to mimic his platform in order to share in the electoral spoils. 201d  The GOP is likely to be recast even if Trump loses. For some time now, Republicans have agonized over how to expand their appeal. Some Nevertrumplings have written of rebuilding the  201cconservative movement 201d after purging it of all those who have been  201ctainted 201d by their support for, or insufficient opposition to, Trump. That is a plan for contracting the party 2019s appeal, not expanding it.  But the talk of purges is a fantasy anyway 2014an empty threat. Fred Barnes and John O 2019Sullivan still appear on the mastheads of the Weekly Standard and National Review, respectively, notwithstanding their deviations from the Nevertrump line. Even if Trump loses, it is quite possible that  201cTrumpism 201d will turn out to be an ascendant force in the GOP, just as movement conservatism did after Barry Goldwater got trounced in 1964.  As Somin acknowledges,  201cTrump is not completely isolated in the GOP, and there are others in the party 2019s base who share his commitments. 201d Win or lose, Trump supporters and movement conservatives will have to make some accommodation if the GOP is to remain a viable means of exercising political power. That, not the enforcement of ideological purity, is the purpose of a political party.  Somin hints at the alternative, concluding with a quote from Alexander Hamilton that is a favorite of the Nevertrump right:  201cIf we must have an enemy at the head of government, let it be one whom we can oppose, and for whom we are not responsible. 201d  Hamilton said that in 1800, in urging fellow Federalists to oppose the re-election of John Adams. Hamilton got what he wanted, as Thomas Jefferson prevailed. That worked out badly for Hamilton, who was killed in an 1804 duel by Jefferson 2019s vice president.  No such end awaits Trump 2019s Republican and conservative detractors in the 21st century. But consider the fate of the Federalist Party: It never won another presidential election and had gone extinct by 1824.

D 00dcNYA took the stage at the American Islamic Congress in Boston on May 19 to perform Sanlikol 2019s original score  201cPalindrome. 201d Sanlikol also teaches music at Brown University, Emerson College, College of the Holy Cross, and Rhode Island College.  Q. What does D 00dcNYA mean?  A. It means  201cthe world, 201d or  201cthe globe. 201d The word itself is traditionally Arabic. Over the course of many centuries and different cultures borrowing it, it 2019s sort of been transformed. Sometimes it may also refer to the spiritual world, but that depends on the culture and context.  Q. Can you tell me a little bit about  201cPalindrome 201d?  A. Well, a palindrome is something  2014 whether it 2019s a number, word, or something else  2014 that reads the same way both forward and backward, like  201cmadam 201d or  201cradar. 201d But the idea for the title and the music came from my personal experience as a Turkish immigrant. I left Turkey in 1993, at the age of 18, to study jazz at Berklee. After Berklee, I got my master 2019s at the New England Conservatory, and I unexpectedly rediscovered Turkish music. I think that 2019s portrayed, structurally, through my composition. It starts off quietly with ethnic instruments and just two musicians. As the music goes on, it starts becoming more and more inclusive, adding other instruments and it eventually turns into a jazz combo, with all 13 musicians. And then it ends again with quiet, ethnic instruments.  Q. When you say you  201cunexpectedly 201d rediscovered Turkish music, what do you mean?  A. I think it was early January in 2000, and I was playing a game of Risk. A friend of mind thought it would be funny to download MP3s of an Ottoman Turkish gentry band, like old bands that used to accompany Ottoman Turkish armies to battle. I heard this folk song and I just couldn 2019t wrap my head around it. I 2019d been writing and playing music since the age of 5, but I was just so stuck on this song. After that, I was hooked on learning more about their music.  Q. How does  201cPalindrome 201d speak to the larger immigrant community?  A. The piece was based so heavily on my personal experience, but the goal is providing an inspiration to all immigrants who are in the process of their own self-discovery.  Q. Has Boston influenced any of your work?  A. The city of Boston has made this possible for me, actually. I was able to come here in search of what I thought I wanted [studying jazz] and given the time and the freedom to explore that and create a much more complete version of my own self and my identity. I thought going to Berklee was like going to paradise. I was the hippest cat in town, walking around my hometown with that Berklee brochure. When I got to the lobby [of Berklee], it was a bit of a cold shower, but all I cared about was absorbing as much information as possible. And then after I was done with Berklee and I was attending the Conservatory, I was able to do an exchange program in Istanbul. Plus, having Harvard right around the corner, I could sit in on their Ottoman studies lectures.  Q. What kind of music do you teach at Brown, Emerson, Holy Cross, and RIC?  A. At Brown, I teach lessons of ethnic instruments, and a  201cMusic of Turkey 201d seminar. At the College of the Holy Cross, I teach mostly Western music, intro to composition, jazz, and music theory. And at Emerson and RIC, I teach world music lectures, and some classes on Indonesian music.  Q. Do you find that you draw on your own experiences when teaching?  A. When I was in school, a professor once told me the best examples are the ones that come from personal experience, and I 2019ve carried that idea throughout my years of teaching. Sometimes I play my own music in the class, or talk about my roots, and hopefully students can understand and relate to that.  Q. D 00dcNYA 2019s work was nominated for a Grammy last year, right?  A. We were not among the final four in the world music category, but we were on the ballot as finalists among 60 or so other projects in the world music category.  Q. Can you tell me a little bit about the CD?  A. It was a world music CD, and ironically it actually doesn 2019t have any jazz on it. There 2019s a lot of Greek, Armenian, and Jewish music. I think that 2019s what most people know D 00dcNYA and myself for. But it seems that New England has the hots for world music and not so much for jazz. It was really interesting and kind of ironic that I came here to be a jazz musician, and at the time there were probably 10 jazz clubs. And now, it 2019s 2012, and there are two and a half left. I sort of lived through that decay, but I think it all worked out for the better.

D 00dcNYA took the stage at the American Islamic Congress on May 19 to perform Sanlikol 2019s original score  201cPalindrome. 201d Sanlikol also teaches music at Brown, Emerson, College of the Holy Cross, and Rhode Island College.",

The double Masters champion has moved on from his hoverboard to the futuristic  00a3150,000 flying machine, named the BW Air.  It might take a while before the idea really takes off... but Bubba is certainly excited about it (although there's no footage of him actually flying it).  Watson,37, is involved with the promotion of the amazing gadget ahead of next month's Olympics, where he will play alongside Rickie Fowler, Patrick Reed and Matt Kuchar for Team USA.  Bubba said:  For the first time in 112 years, golf is part of the Olympics. That's a big deal.   So what better time to introduce something exciting for the future of our game?   I've teamed up with Oakley to create a flying, golf cart jetpack.   The futuristic machine can fly at an altitude of 3,000ft and reach a top speed of just under 50mph.  It is powered by a 200hp engine which drives two fans, allowing the pilot to take off and land vertically.  And he jokingly reckons it will change two of golf's biggest problems: slow play, and  annoying  playing partners.  He said:  Golf is always looking to speed up play and that's what the jetpack's going to do.   The biggest advantage is the bird's eye view. It's going to give you a perspective that you've been missing. It's almost an unfair advantage.   You're riding by yourself. You don't have to ride with that annoying golfer that tells you all about his score.

            "input": "text:Bursting out of the blocks in Lane 8, Wayde van Niekerk of South Africa did not see another runner during the entire Olympic 400-meter final.  He didn 2019t need to. His only real competition was the clock.  The South African sprinter broke Michael Johnson 2019s 17-year-old world record on Sunday night in Rio de Janeiro, leaving two of the greatest one-lap runners of this era in his dust. Van Niekerk finished in 43.03 seconds  2014 0.15 of a second faster than Johnson 2019s time in 1999. Johnson 2019s mark was had been considered one of the almost untouchable records in track. The 24-year-old van Niekerk leaned at the finish line, which he really didn 2019t need to do as Kirani James of Grenada and LaShawn Merritt of the United States weren 2019t even in the picture. James, the defending Olympic champion, finished with the silver, and Merritt, who won gold eight years ago in Beijing, hung on for bronze as he staggered across the line.   201cI was running blind all the way, 201d van Niekerk said.  201cI thought someone was going to catch me  2014 what 2019s going on, what 2019s going on, and it gave me motivation to keep on pushing. 201d  Van Niekerk drove a wedge in rivalry between James and Merritt at the world championships last August, when he beat them both with such a lung-searing performance that he left the track on a stretcher.  Now, he is the fastest ever.  This time at the finish, instead of collapsing, van Niekerk dropped to one knee and put his head in his hands. Moments later, he put the multicolor South African flag around his shoulders and took off his spikes. As he did so, van Niekerk pointed at the clock to make sure everyone saw his time. Hard to miss. It was that impressive.  Caterine Ibarg 00fcen of Colombia leapt 15.17 meters to snatch a gold medal in the women 2019s triple jump, fending off Yulimar Rojas of Venezuela to continue her dominance in the event.  Ibarg 00fcen, the two-time world champion, was a favorite going into the Rio Games and produced a season 2019s best jump in the fourth round of the final to take gold.  Rojas 2019s best of 14.98 meters, also in the fourth round, was enough for silver.  Olga Rypakova of Kazakhstan, the London Olympics champion, pulled off the two best jumps of her season, but her 14.74 meters in the fifth round was good enough only for bronze.  CreditChang W. Lee The New York Times  Simone Biles of the United States added a third gold medal to her haul at the Rio de Janeiro Games, easily winning the women 2019s vault final on Sunday afternoon.  Biles,19, averaged 15.966 during her two vaults, well clear of the silver medalist Maria Paseka of Russia and the bronze medalist Giulia Steingruber of Switzerland.  Biles is the first American woman to win Olympic gold in the vault. Her three gold medals at Rio also are the most by an American female gymnast in one Olympics.  Biles will have a chance at more gold later this week when she competes in the event finals in the balance beam and floor exercise.  Aliya Mustafina of Russia ended the United States women 2019s team dominance atop the podium in women 2019s gymnastics.  Mustafina defended her Olympic title on the uneven bars, edging Madison Kocian of the United States in a tight final. Mustafina 2019s score of 15.900 was just a touch better than Kocian 2019s score of 15.833. The difference was the difficulty of Mustafina 2019s routine, which was one-tenth tougher than Kocian 2019s brilliant set.  The United States had won every gold medal available in Rio behind the superstar Simone Biles. It ended when Mustafina nailed her dismount on her way to an eighth Olympic medal.  Sophie Scheder of German was third.  Gabby Douglas of the United States, the 2012 Olympic all-around champion, finished seventh.

Hasanboy Dusmatov of Uzbekistan captured the gold medal in the light flyweight division, defeating Yurberjen Mart 00ednez of Colombia by unanimous decision.  Dusmatov swept the scorecards, winning by 30-27, 30-27 and 29-28.  Nico Hernandez of the United States and Joahnys Argilagos of Cuba shared the bronze. Hernandez is the first American boxer to win a medal since 2008.  Jason Kenny defeated Callum Skinner in an all-Britain final inside the velodrome to defend his individual sprint Olympic gold medal and win his second gold of the Rio Games.  Kenny and Skinner combined with Philip Hindes to win the team sprint Thursday night.  Kenny overtook Skinner on the final straightaway to win the first of their best-of-three race, then showed some veteran poise as he held off Skinner from the lead to make it a sweep.  It was Kenny 2019s fifth Olympic gold medal and sixth medal over all. The performance also gave the powerful British track cycling team four gold medals and six over all in Rio.  Denis Dmitriev of Russia swept past Matt Glaetzer of Australia to take the bronze.  Andy Murray is making a habit of accomplishing things that had not been done in a while. Or ever.  Murray became the first tennis player in Olympic history with two singles gold medals, winning his second in a row by wearing down Juan Mart 00edn del Potro of Argentina, 7-5, 4-6, 6-2, 7-5, in a final that lasted just over four hours.  At the 2012 London Olympics, Murray won a singles gold and a mixed doubles silver at the All England Club.

            "input": "text:I told the bus driver that I knew the island. I told him that I 2019d spent my childhood summers here on Ischia, this volcanic island of 60,000 off the coast of Naples, and that I didn 2019t need directions. That was an hour ago, when I first boarded the bus at the island 2019s main port. Now I was stranded on a beach with my suitcase, my high heels sinking into the sand. The pastel cliff-side houses of Sant 2019Angelo 2014the fishing village that was my destination 2014glittered across the small bay. I 2019d taken the wrong bus.  I 2019d experienced Sant 2019Angelo (population about 1,000) mostly as a child. My mother, an expat living in Rome, had come here every summer for 20 years before I was born, and she brought me back almost every July until my teens. I had flashing memories of eating garlicky vongole with my fingers, of cones stuffed with gelato, of staying out until midnight, unsupervised, with the Neapolitan children of other summer regulars, the whole town firm in its conviction that nothing too bad or too dangerous could ever happen here. I had my first sip of beer here, at 12; my first illicit cigarette. But as I stood on Maronti Beach, after my bus misadventure, I wondered how well I really knew the island. Years earlier, I could have walked along the beach to Sant 2019Angelo, but since I was last here, the Tyrrhenian Sea had eroded the narrow shoreline. Perhaps the town had changed too. I imagined a piazza full of impossibly stylish cocktail bars, restaurants I could no longer afford. (After all, Angela Merkel had started summering here.)  But, I soon came to learn, change comes slowly to Ischia. This rugged, mountainous island has escaped the relentless gentrification of nearby Capri. Its southern coast feels especially removed from the forward march of the rest of the world. Lizards still seem to outnumber houses. Wine at beachside restaurants still goes for $4 a carafe. Though the luggage-mules of my childhood had given way, at last, to electric carts, the rock-hewn villas around Sant 2019Angelo were as riotously encumbered by vegetation as I remembered them.  The town remembered me, too. A lifeguard, taking pity on me, hailed a water-taxi ($3) so I could cross the bay, crystalline and virtually empty, even now, in June. The boat stopped a few feet from the beach. One of the sailors hopped out and, thigh-deep in water, lifted me straight up 2014as I clutched my laptop bag 2014above the waves. At Sant 2019Angelo 2019s Fumarole Beach, where hot springs heat the silver sands, a grey-bearded, sun-withered man called Davide, who had been selling pareos and jewelry along the water since before I could walk, recognized me and called over one of the electric carts to take me to my hotel. I had booked a few nights at the hillside Casa Garibaldi, where, as soon as I arrived, the proprietress Luisa Iacano, and her mother, Giuseppina, well into her 80s, embraced me. A new house dog had replaced the one I remembered. Their wireless internet only worked in a single corner of the sea-facing, mosaic-tiled terrace; the rooms had no phone signal. None of the many regular visitors seemed to mind.  Sant 2019Angelo 2019s sense of traditionalism, I found, bordered on the ferocious. The waterfront Ristorante Emanuela, a favorite of mine that had been run by a gregariously imperious woman of the same name, was now overseen by her two sons, Riccardo and Sergio. A vast network of relatives served as the wait staff, ferrying fresh clams and squid 2014seasoned with the particularly piquant peperoncino that distinguishes the island 2019s cuisine 2014from the kitchen to the seaside tables. Emanuela still insists on regularly taste-testing the mixed seafood pasta dish that bears her name. The mud baths at Terme Cavascura thermal spa, one of the island 2019s biggest attractions, are still inaccessible by car. The spa, a plaster shack nestled into a rock wall, overlooks a grotto of natural hot-springs in use since the days of Ancient Rome. For between $13 and $30, depending on the spa package, visitors can get a private thermal-clay mud bath and visit the naturally heated showers, pools and sauna. On days when the bay is too rough for a water-taxi, visitors must take the vertiginous, barely paved footpath to reach the spa. But the journey has its own rewards: It wends past Taverna Pietro Paolo detto Stalino, built into the cliffs. In operation since the late 19th century, it serves simple pasta dishes for as little as $6 a plate.  Meals run a little pricier at the restaurants in Sant 2019Angelo 2019s piazzetta, which faces the sea, where places like Il Peppino and Il Pescatore are as spendy as those you 2019d find in Capri. But the mood all around the piazzetta is relaxed and buoyant. I sensed a spirit of joyful anarchy at odds with the sizable yachts docked in the bay: Unattended children eating gelato on the rocks, teenagers drinking Peronis on the pier, diving every so often into the warm, turquoise sea. At the piazzetta 2019s waterfront La Tavernetta del Pirata, equal parts ceramic museum and cheesy piano bar, I drank an inexplicably delicious admixture of prosecco and port and nibbled on the olives, white bean salad and other snacks that came my way at irregular intervals, listening to lilting Italian covers of  201980s pop hits.  On my way back up the hill to the hotel, I noticed a familiar-looking, wildly handsome Italian man in his 20s. It took me a moment to realize where I 2019d last seen him, almost a decade ago, as a chubby teenager with blond frosted-tip hair, another regular at Casa Garibaldi. He 2019d been coming every summer, he said; first with his parents, then with his girlfriend. The other children I 2019d played with 2014all grown now 2014were heading over in a few weeks: The caretaker of slender Petrelle Beach would soon be reserving sunbeds for them.  On my last day in Ischia, I hiked from Sant 2019Angelo into the hill town of Serrara, where the old women gather at the 19th-century churches for vespers on Saturday nights. Then I continued on to the top of Monte Epomeo, the island 2019s highest peak, at 2,588 feet. Tufa rock and dry brush gave way to honeysuckle and wisteria, bird of paradise and yellow ginestra, then to thick forests. Field mice replaced the lizards. Vineyards, growing on the slopes, were each  201cgated 201d by a repurposed bedframe 2014an Ischian custom.  As I prepared to make the final ascent, I stopped for water at a treehouse-style cafe near a sacred grotto. One of the patrons, a jovial man named Nicola 2014holding court at the bar counter to the amusement of the silent proprietress 2014informed me that my face was red  201cas a Ferrari. 201d He followed up by offering me various items of the same color: a rose, a plate of bruschetta, an armful of fresh cherries he 2019d picked himself.  On my descent, halfway down Epomeo, I took a wrong turn and found myself deep into a forest carpeted with wildflowers. I was lost, once again; this time, I didn 2019t mind.  Getting There: Ischia 2019s main port, on the island 2019s northeast coast, is a 50-minute ferry ride (on an aliscafo, or hydrofoil) from Naples 2019s Beverello port. To reach Sant 2019Angelo, take the CS bus.  Staying There: Casa Garibaldi, a 15-minute walk uphill from the piazzetta, has its own thermal pools and a large terrace overlooking the sea (from about $100 a night in summer, casagaribaldi.it). On Sant 2019Angelo 2019s waterfront, the high-end Miramare Sea Resort shares the pools and private beach with the elegant Aphrodite Apollon spa complex (from about $375 a night, miramaresearesort.it en).  Eating There: With the exception of La Tavernetta del Pirata (77 Via Sant 2019Angelo), avoid the restaurants on Sant 2019Angelo 2019s piazzetta in favor of the more casual, inexpensive spots further afield. Ristorante Emanuela, on Petrelle Beach, offers fresh, simple seafood (ristorantemanuela.com). For the tastiest version of Ischia 2019s signature braised rabbit, coniglio all 2019ischitana, book a table at Al Comignolo in Serrara; order the set menu, which consists of a whole rabbit preceded by a pasta in rabbit sauce ( ristorantealcomignolo.it). Summary: Forget Capri. Off the coast of Naples, the small isle of Ischia has countless, picturesque villages, amazing deals and a delightful stuck-in-time quality",

            "input": "text:Class had never been the couple 2019s strong suit, and the divorce trial promised to be an exercise in cheap theatrics. Still, the face-off between aging temptress Joan Collins,54, and fourth husband Peter Holm,40, defied all expectations: Their five-day settlement hearing in Los Angeles was a turgid scandalfest that could have been scripted by one of Dynasty 2018s own sudsmeisters. Here was a teary Joan, declaring,  201cI 2019ve been taken advantage of by men since I was 20. 201d Here was the shameless Swede, asking his wife of 13 months for more than $2.6 million and calling her  201cthe woman I love. 201d And here was a central-casting surprise-witness Other Woman 2014a busty striver who fainted on the stand.  And so, with a full house in the 45-seat courtroom, reporters jostling for position outside the door and TV monitors relaying increasingly improbable plot turns, a window slowly opened on one of Hollywood 2019s most visible, volatile and ill-fated marriages. Curiously, the one point on which attorneys for both parties agreed was that the Collins-Holm union was a bad match. With surprising candor, Joan 2019s attorney, the ubiquitous Marvin Mitchelson, blamed the prenuptial agreement for the failed union.  201cI never saw a prenuptial agreement yet that didn 2019t wind up in a divorce, 201d Mitchelson said outside the court.  201cWith Joan and Peter, I think they were doomed from the start. 201d. Frank Steinschriber, Holm 2019s attorney, concurred.  201cGoing into marriage not trusting each other, 201d said Steinschriber, was a prescription for failure.  Having met in London in 1983, Collins and Holm lived together for two and a half years, spending more than a year arguing about the prenuptial agreement. Holm, an erstwhile Swedish pop star, eventually agreed to a 20 percent take, and the happy couple then pledged their undying love in a Las Vegas chapel on Nov. 6, 1985. Approximately a year later, according to her divorce papers, Joan was suffering  201cextreme stress and anxiety, 201d abetted in no small way by Holm 2019s claim that the bag he always carried around contained explosives.  Holm admitted that Collins had threatened divorce, but never took her seriously because he thought  201cshe was just acting. 201d In an interview given to PEOPLE a few days before the trial, while he was resisting eviction from Joan 2019s Bowmont Drive home above Beverly Hills, Peter claimed the divorce came as a surprise.  201cEverything was lovey-dovey, 201d he said while tossing a balled-up $20 bill to a reporter 2019 outside, hoping the journalist could get the electricity turned back on.  201cWe 2019d had a few arguments. We agreed to meet for lunch and talk things over. Instead, someone from her attorney 2019s office was at the restaurant. He handed me something and said,  2018These are divorce papers. 2019 I was stunned and flabbergasted. 201d  That was the stand Holm took in court. He portrayed himself as a loyal husband and dedicated business manager. Maintaining that he was entitled to live in the manner to which he had become accustomed chez Collins, Holm asked for $80,000 a month in temporary support. Declaring that the prenuptial agreement wasn 2019t legally binding, he wanted an even split of the couple 2019s property and of the $5.2 million Collins had earned since the wedding. Collins 2019 response to his arguments:  201cLies, lies, lies, 201d she scrawled on her notepad.  Mitchelson contended that the 20-percent agreement was valid. Calling Holm  201caeon man, 201d the attorney alleged that a portion of the money Peter had managed remained unaccounted for; besides, the $2 million in salary and expenses that he already had extracted was  201ca lot for a 13-month marriage. 201d Said Mitchelson:  201cHe 2019s a big, strapping fellow. If he wants more money, he can go out and earn it. 201d  Throughout the hearing, the subject was usually money. Lots of it. Seven-figure salaries. Million-dollar homes. Complimentary BMWs for two after Peter arranged a publicity appearance for Joan. Nasty glances careened across the courtroom on a regular basis. Peter, forbidden by a restraining order from talking to Joan, used his spare moments on the stand to stare soulfully into her eyes . She 2019d stare back, occasionally softening. Was a reconciliation in the offing? If not, who the hell was winning the case? The main barometer of success seemed to be the press. Each day an envelope marked  201cConfidential 201d would be messengered from Collins 2019 public relations firm. Inside were photostats of articles about the hearing from the London and New York papers. Collins and her camp would pour over them, gauging public reaction.  Thursday morning brought a sign that something was up. Suddenly communicative with the media, Collins waved a victory sign to the camera crews on her way into the courtroom and sashayed over to a PEOPLE reporter parked inside.  201cI feel fabulous 2014ready to win, 201d she said.  201cI 2019ve finally gotten myself back together. 201d  Her secret tonic was discovered hours later, when a flurry of activity announced the arrival of a young woman who looked to have been invented by Frederick 2019s of Hollywood. Wearing a white babushka and a skintight white dress with a zipper down the front, she tottered into the courtroom in leopard-print spikes. She was Romina Danielson,23, a bronzed bombshell who had been married to a friend of Holm, real estate developer Axel Danielson, 80. In histrionic testimony delivered throughout the afternoon, Holm was accused of being Romina 2019s lover during his marriage to Collins. Barely audible and appearing sedated, Romina said the affair began in 1985.  201cPeter called me his passion flower 2026.He told me the color gets deeper and deeper red if the flower had not been pulled from the ground. He said I haven 2019t blossomed yet. 201d  Weeping, Romina told the court that Holm had hatched a scheme to stay with Joan for a length of time, then split with jointly held property. About 10 minutes into her testimony, she wilted.  201cWe continued our 2026sexual liaison through 1985. There came a time when I thought I was pregnant 2026. 201d Incredibly, on that note, her head rolled back and she slithered down in her chair, moaning and sobbing. A wide-eyed, smiling Collins stood up, straightened her skirt, picked up her purse and walked past the faded heap of passion on her way out of court. The room erupted. Romina came around and clawed at her bodice to free her heaving breasts as she gasped for air. Mitchelson and a female sheriff dashed to her side. With the cameras crowding in, she screamed hysterically until she was trundled into an ambulance.  201cI didn 2019t believe it, 201d recalled Mitchelson.  201cI couldn 2019t have scripted that scene any better. 201d  By Friday, Holm was wondering if Mitchelson had written the script. By a fortuitous twist of fate, Romina 2014whose testimony Peter had called  201crubbish 201d 2014was indisposed and thus unavailable for cross-examination. Judge Earl F. Riley ordered her testimony stricken from the record, but its memory lingered: Riley thanked both lawyers for  201ca very interesting trial 201d before ruling that the prenuptial agreement was valid.  Leaving the court, Collins was triumphant but somber.  201cI 2019d always hoped that if anything went wrong, Peter and I would remain friends and walk away from it, 201d she said.  201cUnfortunately, we haven 2019t been able to do that. I wish him well. He 2019s a stubborn man. 201d Mitchelson came up and threw his arm around her. She gave him a big kiss. The two of them posed, smiling for the cameras, and the court was finally afforded the sight of a truly happy couple. Summary: Class had never been the couple 2019s strong suit, and the divorce trial promised to be an exercise in cheap theatrics. Still, the face-off between aging temptress Joan Collins,54, and fourth hu 2026",

            "input": "text:Donald Trump, during Wednesday night 2019s debate, painted a picture of a US economy in shambles. Here in Massachusetts, we could be forgiven for wondering what he was talking about.  Bay State workers are enjoying one of the best job markets in recent history. According to data released Thursday, the state 2019s unemployment rate fell to 3.6 percent in September, from 3.9 percent the prior month. That 2019s not just substantially below the national average of 5 percent, it 2019s about as low as unemployment ever gets.  So here 2019s the question (with apologies to Chubby Checker): How low can we go?  Ultimately, the weight of evidence suggests that we could probably push the unemployment rate down a little further, but not much.  There is a point, according to economists, at which unemployment actually gets too low. If it becomes too easy for workers to find jobs, businesses start fighting over them, offering ever-larger raises and bonuses. That may sound great for workers, but for employers it means higher costs.  The state 2019s unemployment rate, which was 3.9 percent in August, fell even further last month, to 3.6 percent.  And that can set off an inflationary spiral. Wages go up, forcing companies to boost prices, which then requires ever larger raises to keep up with spending needs  2014 and on and on.  The goal, in economic policy, is to find the sweet spot called  201cfull employment, 201d where jobs are plentiful, wages are rising, and inflation is under control.  No one knows exactly where this mystical sweet spot lies, but most economists think it corresponds to a nationwide unemployment rate between 4 and 5 percent, with the best-performing states in the 3 to 4 percent range. In other words, just about where we are right now.  And here 2019s another reason to think we might really be approaching full employment: Other, broader measures paint the same picture of a roaring job market.  Take what 2019s called the prime age employment rate. It 2019s a very simple measure, telling us how many 25- to 54-year-olds have jobs. But over time it has proved to be an extremely accurate indicator. And it suggests that Massachusetts has made up for all the losses of the Great Recession. Right now, 81.1 percent of 25- to 54-year-olds have jobs, according to calculations from the Economic Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank that focuses on the needs of low- and middle-income workers. In 2007, before the financial crisis, it was 81.2 percent.  Having said all that, there are reasons to think the Massachusetts job market can get even better.  For one thing, there 2019s no sign of a wage-price spiral. Census data from 2015 show that Massachusetts workers got a relatively slim boost in 2015, well under 2 percent. And while separate numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics tell a rosier story, they don 2019t show a recent surge.  Even more revealing, this isn 2019t our best work. In 2000, at the tail end of the dot-com boom, the unemployment rate in Massachusetts was 2.6 percent, a full percentage point lower than today 2019s. And at that time, over 84 percent of prime age workers had jobs, also substantially higher than today.  So while September 2019s unemployment rate shows remarkable economic strength, it 2019s probably not the peak of Massachusetts 2019 potential.  Whether we reach that peak, however, is mostly out of our hands. The near-term fate of Massachusetts 2019 economy depends on a pair of fateful political decisions happening far from Beacon Hill.  One: Will the Federal Reserve Board raise rates in December, tapping the brakes in order to slow economic growth?  Two: Who will carry the election and set the agenda for America 2019s economic future? Summary: The evidence suggests we could probably push the unemployment rate down a little further, but not much.",

WASHINGTON -- U.S. home resales rose in June to their fastest pace in eight months, a signal that the housing market was pulling out of a slump.  The National Association of Realtors said Tuesday existing home sales increased 2.6 percent to an annual rate of 5.04 million units.  That was above analyst expectations and marked the third straight month the pace of home resales accelerated.  The housing recovery stalled in the second half of 2013 as interest rates increased and a dwindling supply of properties available for sale pushed prices sharply higher.  But mortgage rates have eased a bit in recent months and the nation's job market has improved, helping the market for homes.  May's rate of sales was revised upward to a 4.91 million unit pace from the previously reported 4.89 million unit rate.  Also supporting home sales, more homes are being put on the market, keeping prices from rising as quickly.  The number of homes on the market for resale rose to 2.3 million in June, the highest level since August 2012 and 6.5 percent more than in June of last year.  The 7 Biggest Financial Mistakes 40-Somethings Make  Pace of Existing Home Sales Rises to 8-Month High  If you've been making mortgage payments for a while now, it may have become just another task you do automatically each month. But it's time to start thinking about your end game. When will your house officially be paid in full, and how will that date intersect with your other plans? Do you need to adjust anything to make your  mortgage freedom  date align with the rest of your life? For example: Do you want to have your house paid off by the time your kids leave for college? If so, start scrutinizing the timing, so you can figure out if you need to make extra payments.  The average student graduating in 2014 emerged with $29,000 in student loan debt. There's no predicting what that number will be once your children are ready to don a cap and gown. But you don't want your kids to be saddled with tens of thousands in debt as they begin their adult lives (or potentially live in your basement well into their 30s because of that debt). While your children should absolutely apply for every scholarship they can, you can't count on them getting what they'll need. So. there's no time like the present to start seriously building up their college funds. If you're not quite sure about the best ways for you to do that (529 plans are great, but they're not the only good choise), a fee-only financial adviser can walk you through your options.  Are you putting aside enough for retirement? Aim to  , or save 25 times your current annual expenses. Once you have that final number in mind, use an online retirement calculator or sit down with a financial adviser to come up with a plan for how much you'll need to save each year to reach it. If you haven't already done this, don't delay another day. Future You will thank you.  Credit card debt is a shackle that can prevent you from reaching every other monetary goal on your list. One of the first things you need to do to get your financial house in order is to eliminate all consumer debt -- the sooner, the better. Otherwise, you're losing money each month that could be put to better use elsewhere. Make debt payoff a top priority. Try an aggressive method like the  debt snowball,  where you throw every extra dime you can at your smallest balance until you've decimated that bill. Then move to the next one on the list and continue amassing  victories  until you're done with every debt. Where can you find the money to accelerate your debt payoff? Reduce your expenses or take a temporary second job, if necessary. The sooner you free yourself from debt, the better.  Your current vehicle won't last forever, no matter how diligent you are at taking care of it. When it comes time to buy a new car, will you have saved enough to make the purchase in cash? As you get older, you should be systematically reducing the number of financial obligations you're saddled with -- not adding on new ones. Car loans take from three to seven years to pay off. (The current average length is around 5 00bd years.) Even if your current car lasts you well into your 50s, financing a new one could mean that you'll be facing loan payments into your retirement years. Instead, plan ahead so you can pay cash.  If you're married, have children or support your parents financially, you should have term life insurance. Tragedies can happen at any time, and term insurance can help you create a Plan B for the benefit of those who rely on you. If you're healthy, you can get term life insurance coverage with a $500,000 benefit for roughly $29 a month. That's a small price to pay to know your family will be cared for if anything happens to you. The longer you wait to get that coverage, the higher your price will be.  Just like life insurance, disability insurance is a wise investment. (And, just like life insurance, the longer you wait to get it, the higher your monthly payments will be.) Should you fall ill or get injured and be unable to work for a period of time, disability insurance can pay out 50 percent to 70 percent of your income. Hopefully, you'll never need to use it -- but you never want to be in a spot where you do need it and you don't have it.

The spending watchdog has come under pressure from the influential Treasury Select Committee (TSC) of MPs to review the guidance that UK Financial Investments (UKFI) gave the Government prior to the taxpayers 2019 stake in RBS being cut in August 2015.  In correspondence published by the TSC today, Sir Amyas Morse, the head of the NAO, confirmed the watchdog expects to look at the controversial share sale as part of a broader review of the stewardship of the Government 2019s investment banks bailed out during the financial crisis.   201cIt is likely that my review will consider how UKFI makes key decisions relating to Government 2019s shareholdings in RBS, 201d Sir Amyas wrote in a letter to Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative MP who chairs the TSC.  201cIt is also likely that this will extend to a number of case studies, including the decision to sell RBS shares. 201d  The move was welcomed by Mr Tyrie, who in the past has unsuccessfully recommended that UKFI be abolished because of his belief it did not stop political interference in the state-owned banks.   201cParliament and the public will want reassurance that the Government secured the best value for money for the taxpayer, 201d he said today.  UKFI is the arm's-length agency that manages the taxpayers 2019 stakes in both RBS and Lloyds Banking Group. While the Government has cut its stake in the latter from 43pc to less than 8pc, it still holds 73pc of RBS, which is led by boss Ross McEwan. It has only sold shares in RBS once, when the then-Chancellor George Osborne came in for criticism for incurring a loss.  In 2013, the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, which was chaired by Mr Tyrie, raised concerns that UKFI would  201cincreasingly be perceived as a fig leaf to disguise the reality of direct Government control 201d at RBS and Lloyds. It concluded that political interference at the banks was inevitable and it would be better that UKFI be wound up and its resources be pumped into the Treasury, advice that Mr Osborne rejected.  Philip Hammond, Mr Osborne 2019s successor as Chancellor, has indicated a further reduction of the Government 2019s stake in RBS is unlikely for some time.  He wants the bank to reach a potentially costly settlement with the US Department of Justice over its sale of mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the crisis before any more shares are offloaded. Mr Hammond also wants RBS to divest its William & Glyn branch network, a disposal forced on the bank by the European Commission as a condition of its 2008 bailout and which the lender is struggling to achieve.

Large fuel retailers will be required by state law from January 1 to ensure three per cent of their petrol sales each quarter are biofuel-based.  RACQ spokeswoman Lauren Ritchie said the mandate shouldn't affect competition across the state or fuel choices at the bowser.   There's been some concern retailers will opt to remove unleaded petrol altogether to reach the E10 sales quota, as was the case in NSW, but we are assured the lower mandate in Queensland will prevent this from occurring,  she said.  An RACQ fuel sales data analysis showed that 35.6 million litres of E10 was sold in Queensland in October, which was an 11 per cent increase on the previous month but still only half of the mandated volume.  Acting Premier Jackie Trad said the government would continue to work with the fuel industry to ensure the mandate was taken up without affecting motorists.   We have a voluntary E10 or ethanol blend at every service station ... and what we do see is differences in the choice that consumers have at the bowser, and that will continue,  Ms Trad said on Friday.   The government is very happy to keep working with petrol stations and the fuel industry to make sure our commitment is delivered on.

            "input": "text:In the Pittsburgh Pirates' case, the dream could become a reality for fans. The Pirates are strongly considering a plan in which it would offer shares of stock in the club to the public.  Major League Baseball's ruling Executive Council gave permission for clubs to sell public shares last summer. So far, no team has taken that action but the Pirates could become the first.  Other major professional sports leagues allow teams to offer stock. So far, it's the Green Bay Packers, the NBA's Boston Celtics and NHL's Florida Panthers.  When asked about the idea of offering public stock following the Executive Council's ruling last year, Pirates Chief Executive Officer Kevin McClatchy said it was doubtful his club would go through with such a plan.  McClatchy, though, now acknowledges the Pirates are considering the plan but said only  it's in the exploratory states.   However, club sources say McClatchy believes the Pirates could generate as much as $45 million through the sale of stock.  Sources also say McClatchy's plan is unrelated to the Pirates' effort of securing funding for a baseball-only stadium in Pittsburgh. In November, southwestern Pennsylvania voters overwhelming rejected a proposed sales tax that would have funded new stadiums for the Pirates and NFL's Steelers along with other projects.   Going public is more a move to reduce some of the club's debt than anything,  one source said.  It would generate revenue independent of any stadium. Kevin thinks it would be a good novelty item, something that would get the fans involved while adding some revenue.   McClatchy led a group that purchased the Pirates for $95 million on Feb. 14, 1995 from a public-private consortium of 12 owners.  While McClatchy claimed to have lost in excess of $10 million in '96, the Pirates figured to turn a profit in 1997 after finishing second in the National League Central despite having the smallest payroll in baseball. The Pirates' payroll was $9 million at the start of last season before growing to $12 million by the end of the year  The Packers were the first to try selling shares to the public, beginning in 1950 when the organization sold about 2,000 shares to raise $116,000 to keep the team in Green Bay. Each share sold for $25, and a stockholder could hold no more than 200 shares.  The shares, however, were not publicly traded, so they never increased in value. They also could not be redeemed, meaning the only value they have to stockholders is sentimental.  Shares in the Celtics and Panthers are actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange and fluctuate in value, like any other stock.  While the Pirates ponder their stock options, they have come up with a more tried and true way of generative more revenue. They have raised ticket prices at Three Rivers Stadium for only the second time in seven years.  The price of first-level club boxes, which will now be known as field boxes, will be $17, a $2 increase. Second-level club boxes will go up $1 to $16. Terrace boxes on the fourth and fifth levels will also increase $1 to $11.  Prices for the remaining 27,871 seats remain the same: $10 for family boxes, $8 for reserved, $5 for general admission and $1 for youth general admission.  The Pirates' average ticket price is $9.67, making them just one of four teams in the major leagues under $10.  NOTES, QUOTES, ANECDOTES The Pirates signed seven minor-league free agents last Wednesday (Jan. 7), including former San Francisco Giants reliever Steve Mintz.  Mintz,29, was 5-2 with an 8.05 ERA in 27 relief appearances for San Diego's Triple-A Las Vegas farm club last year. He pitched in 14 games with San Francisco in 1995, going 1-2 with a 7.45 ERA.  Also signed were left-handers Kevin Tolar and Scott Wiegandt, right-hander Todd Bussa, first basemen Kevin Grijak and Dave Kennedy and outfielder Phil Geisler. None have played in the major leagues.  Tolar,26, was 1-1 with a 5.12 ERA in 22 games with the New York Mets' Double-A Binghamton farm club last season and 0-0 with a 2.03 ERA in nine games with Single-A St. Lucie.  Wiegandt,30, was 1-3 with a 4.45 ERA in 40 games, three starts, with St. Louis' Triple-A Louisville farm club last season.  Bussa,25, was 5-4 with a 1.75 ERA in 30 games with Oakland's Single-A Modesto farm club last season and 2-1 with a 4.22 ERA in 19 games with Double-A Huntsville.  Grijak,24, hit .250 with 13 homers and 48 RBIs in 72 games with Atlanta's Double-A Greenville farm club last season.  Kennedy,27, played for St. Paul in the independent Northern League last season and hit .293 with 19 homers and 80 RBIs in 92 games.  Geisler,28, hit .256 with nine homers and 57 RBIs in 109 games with the Mets' Triple-A Norfolk last season.  The Pirates began their three-week promotional winter caravan on Monday (Jan. 12). It will continue through Jan. 30. Manager Gene Lamont will participate in part of the tour along with left-hander Jason Christiansen, right-hander Rich Loiselle, catchers Jason Kendall and Keith Osik, second baseman Tony Womack, shortstop Kevin Polcovich and outfielder Emil Brown.  The caravan will make stops in Washington, Uniontown, Connellsville, Punxsutawney, DuBois, Clearfield, Greensburg, Latrobe, Altoona, Johnson, Indiana, Somerset, Clarion, Erie, Beaver, New Castle, Franklin and Butler in Pennsylvania; Cambridge and Youngstown in Ohio and Wheeling, New Martinsville, Morgantown, Fairmont and Weirton in West Virginia.  ROSTER REPORT FREE AGENCY UPDATE -- Shortstop Shawon Dunston (not offered salary arbitration), shortstop Kevin Elster (signed with the Rangers), infielder Dale Sveum (signed with the Yankees).  MEDICAL WATCH -- Right-handed pitcher Esteban Loaiza (recovering from arthroscopic surgery to remove bone chips from right ankle), second baseman Tony Womack (recovering from arthroscopic surgery to remove to have bone chips removed from left knee).  WINTER WATCH --- Well-traveled outfielder Darryl Brinkley at least put himself in the Pirates' consciousness with a fine winter season for Mexicali in the Mexican Pacific League. The 28-year-old hit .284 with 11 homers and 27 RBIs in 59 games. He led the league in runs (46), tied for first in hits (67), tied for second in homers (11) and tied for third in steals. The Pirates acquire Brinkley from San Diego's Double-A Mobile farm club midway through last season and assigned him to the Mexico City Reds of the Mexican League.

            "input": "text:eople came from all over last week to attend a Federal Trade Commission workshop in Washington on spyware, one more plague of the digital age. They all agreed on one thing: they could not define spyware.   Spyware is in the eye of the beholder,  said Ari Schwartz, associate director of the Center for Democracy and Technology, a policy research group in Washington.  In general, spyware - called adware by its proponents - is software that shows up on a computer unannounced, often because the owner has signed up for a free service like a file-sharing network or has agreed to receive messages in return for gaining access to a Web site. The software usually delivers pop-up ads, but sometimes performs other actions without the owner understanding what is going on or how to stop it.  The controversy involves more than consumer inconvenience, tech companies say. Such software is now the No. 1 reason that consumers call Dell for technical support, Maureen Cushman, legal counsel to Dell's consumer division, told a meeting of the trade commission.  It damages the Dell brand,  she said.  The activities of spyware programs can be relatively benign, obnoxious or even blatantly illegal. Computer users may be driven to distraction by pop-up ads, some pornographic, or find that their PC's become sluggish, laboring under the computing burden of the unwanted programs. Some programs monitor Internet use or even record keystrokes, such as password entries.  Given its range of activities, fighting spyware is a minefield for lawmakers and regulators, but that did not stop one state, Utah, from stepping in. On March 23, Gov. Olene S. Walker signed the nation's first antispyware law, which prohibits software that is installed without the user's consent and programs that send personal information.  The antispyware efforts, like the recent federal move to regulate spam, are following what has become an increasingly familiar pattern in online technology.  In the first phase, after a honeymoon period of increasing popularity, unpleasant practices emerge: once a broad swath of the public had been introduced to the wonders of the Internet, they found themselves bombarded with spam, advertising pop-ups and full-blown spyware. In the second phase, consumers howl and politicians get concerned, but the affected industries urge caution, arguing that regulation will stifle innovation and hurt legitimate business.  Eventually, phase three arrives: states begin to enact laws against the offending practice. Faced with the prospect of a patchwork of possibly conflicting legislation, the industry asks Congress for a uniform, but often less stringent, federal law.  Three other states - California, Iowa and Virginia - are considering legislation aimed at spyware, so it is no surprise that federal legislation has been introduced. In February, Senator Conrad Burns, Republican of Montana, and two Democratic senators, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Barbara Boxer of California, offered a bill titled Software Principles Yielding Better Levels of Consumer Knowledge, known as Spyblock. It would require notice and consent before software could be added to a computer.  Online companies greeted Utah's move with apprehension. The legislation,  while very well-intentioned, would have serious unintended consequences on everyday, legitimate activities on the Internet,  a coalition of companies - including America Online, Amazon.com, Microsoft, Google and Yahoo - warned in a letter to Utah officials.  The new law was immediately challenged by WhenU.com, a company based in New York that puts Internet advertising software on people's machines.  If the statute goes into effect it's going to outlaw what WhenU does,  said Jeffrey D. Neuburger, a lawyer in New York who deals with high-tech issues but does not represent anybody involved in the case.  Mr. Neuburger said that he was no fan of the practices of WhenU and its chief competitor, the Claria Corporation, once known as Gator. But he argued that the Utah law was drafted too broadly and would lead to  frivolous litigation  by companies that say they have been victimized by adware.  The bill's sponsor, state Representative Stephen H. Urquhart, said that the law focused on giving computer owners notice of what was being done to their machines and the opportunity to refuse the software or remove it easily.  I'm convinced over 75 percent of the people who have this on their computers have no idea it's there,  he said.  The law that WhenU.com is challenging has its origins in a lawsuit against the company by a Utah company that sold contact lenses. The company, 1-800-Contacts, said it was losing customers because WhenU was placing ads for lens-selling rivals when visitors came to the 1-800-Contacts site. It sued WhenU in federal court in New York.   We've made substantial investments in our trademark and copyrights and consumer awareness,  said R. Joe Zeidner, vice president for legal affairs at 1-800-Contacts, and  we think there needs to be protection in place for business.   Last December, Federal District Judge Deborah A. Batts granted an injunction prohibiting WhenU from serving pop-up ads for rivals of 1-800-Contacts - a departure from other case law that had supported WhenU's practices.  The chief executive of WhenU, Avi Z. Naider, said that the issue should be resolved in Congress, not on a state-by-state basis. He also said that any law should focus on stopping  rogue behavior,  not outlawing technologies like his company's software-based advertising. He said that WhenU's software had been installed on 100 million machines, and was no longer active on 80 million, indicating it was easy to remove.  Mr. Naider's argument is not convincing to Mr. Zeidner.   His business model, and Gator's business model,'' Mr. Zeidner said,  is to put this on computers faster than the public is being educated and removing it from their computers.  Summary: At a conference last week, participants discussed the controversial issue of spyware. Some critics said it should be outlawed.",

Because crocked footballers have taken one for the team, they've earned the right to prod, rub, bandage and, most importantly, discuss their ailments  2013 at length  2013 in the changing room. Injured runners invariably wind up bored, frustrated and alone.  My training injuries for the Bupa Great South Run have thankfully been minor: a sore knee, a trio of blisters and a left Achilles tendon as tight as a banjo string. Some of my Telegraph team-mates, however, have not been so lucky.  Peter Hutchison suffered an injury to the patellofemoral joint in his right leg or, to quote his layman's diagnosis,  a knackered knee 201d. Although Bupa sports physiotherapist Russell Stocker massaged Pete's knee and strapped his foot up with a special tape that would act as a shock absorber, Pete's  anterior knee pain 201d (Stocker's diagnosis) curtailed his training for several weeks.  But Pete's pain was nothing compared to the agonies suffered by Catalina Stogdon, whose sore and swollen ankle turned out to be  2013 after an MRI scan  2013 the ultimate runner's curse: a stress fracture. There was literally nothing Catalina could do. As she was told by Dr Tom Crisp, a Bupa consultant sports and orthopaedic physician,  running on a stress fracture can set your healing back by months, if not a year 201d. And so that was that: Catalina was out of the race  2013 and our substitute, news sub editor Lloyd Hook, was in.  Reading Catalina's dispirited blog posting about this injury reminded me that amateur athletes can experience the same kind of heartache that David Beckham suffered when he was badly injured in March.  It's broken, it's broken, 201d wailed Becks as he limped off the pitch, crushed by the knowledge that his dream to become the first English player to appear at four World Cups was now in the same condition as his Achilles tendon.  What's more, in terms of the variety of injuries they can pick up, runners are spoilt for choice. According to Alex Floyd, a Bupa musculoskeletal physiotherapist, the most common is runner's knee  2013 or iliotibial band friction syndrome  2013 which is  an irritation of the tendon on the outside of the knee and is largely due to an imbalance of muscle around the hips, pelvis and knee 201d.  Other common running injuries include shin splints (an umbrella term that is applied to  anything from medial tibial stress syndrome up to a stress fracture of the bone 201d), tendonitis, irritated tissue on the sole of the foot and all manner of stress fractures major and minor that can strike at different areas of the foot.  Fortunately, many of these injuries are preventable. Floyd's tips are refreshingly straightforward: make sure you have the correct equipment, especially a pair of running shoes that fit and support you properly; follow an approved training programme so you build up your speed and stamina over weeks rather than days; take regular rests, especially in the early phases of training; and don't try to run while carrying an injury.  There is a wealth of further information about injury prevention and recovery at the Bupa Running website (www.bupa.co.uk running) plus a series of recommended training programmes that you can tailor to your running level and the distance of your race (www.bupa.co.uk running training).  But what if, despite all your meticulous preparation and planning, lightning strikes? Can a runner stay fit while nursing an injury?  This, says Floyd, entirely depends on the type of injury you have.  Some injuries you have to rest completely. But in many cases we can recommend a fitness programme that will keep you as fit as possible while allowing your injury to heal.   Swimming, cycling, or using a cross trainer or step machine might be fine. In Australia, where I come from, a lot of recuperating athletes use deep-water running, in which you run in the sea or a swimming pool wearing a flotation belt. 201d  Thanks to Floyd's help and advice, I am injury-free and looking forward to the Bupa Great South Run. There is one drawback, however: unlike Fernando Torres, I no longer have an excuse for looking off the pace.  Are you ready to run?

            "input": "text:The President has just issued a Proclamation which forms another step in the grand proces against the giant crime of Rebellion. By this Proclamation, made in pursuance of the sixth section of the act of Congress, entitled  An Act to suppress insurrection, to punish treason and rebellion, to seize and confiscate the property of rebels, and for other purposes,  approved July 17,1862, he warns  all persons within the contemplation of said sixth section, to cease participating in, aiding, countenancing or abetting the existing rebellion, or any rebellion against the Government of the United States, and to return to their proper allegiance to the United States, on pain of the forfeitures and seizures as within and by said sixth section provided.   The historian who shall record the progress of the present war will have no trouble in determining the theory on which it was conducted by the United States. Vast though the proportions were which the revolt assumed from the very start, the Government had no difficulty in at once making the diagnosis of the disease in the body politic as an insurrection, a rebellion. The acts of hostility against the Government had, perhaps, assumed such formidable proportions as to be appropriately designated as war; but it was a war of persons owing allegiance to the General or National Government, and not a war of Governments. As Prof. PARKER has well said, those acts were not more than acts of treason because millions were engaged in them, and they were not less than treason because of the assumed titles, military and civil, or of the assumption of State or Confederate authority, under color of which they were committed. Gigantic though the proportions are which the rebellion has since grown to, and complicated though the relations which we hold to the revolted States have become, the complexion of the Southern treason remains, in the eyes of the Government, unchanged. No lapse of time, no change of circumstance, has produced any alteration in the mode of treatment of the  so-called Confederacy  by the United States. The rebels who opened their batteries on Sumter are rebels still, not  belligerents.  The Proclamation which the President issues to-day is the same in theory as that which he made fifteen months ago. In his proclamation of the 15th April,1861, he called on the persons forming treasonable combinations to  disperse and retire peaceably to their respective abodes, within twenty days from this date.  He now addresses the same combinations, commanding them within sixty days to  cease participating in, aiding, countenancing or abetting the existing rebellion.  It is probable enough that the last Proclamation will be heeded no more than was the first. But with that fact we are not now dealing.  In a superficial aspect, it may seem inconsistent with this theory, that not only has the Government repeatedly entered into various transactions of a quasi-international character, such as flags of truce, exchanges, &c, with the Confederates; but that it has just concluded with the rebel authorities a general cartel for the exchange of prisoners, based on the cartel of 1812. The Richmond journals, it will have been noticed from the extracts we have given, are jubilant over this procedure as an acknowledgment of the  quasi-nationality  of the Confederates.  This cartel,  says the Enquirer,  marks an important era in the war. We are by it made belligerents, and the Government of the United Slates treats with the Government of the Confederate States through Commissioners.  The rebels are welcome to whatever comfort or encouragement they can extract from this transaction. But the journal mentioned is entirely off the mark, in claiming that it inaugurates any  new era  in the war. It is needless, at this late day, to recur to the principles and precedents that govern the exchange of prisoners between parties holding to each other the relations that obtain between the United States and the rebels. The whole matter is summed up in the one principle that, in a civil war such as ours, the Sovereign has all the rights of a belligerent in addition to those of Sovereign. This doctrine, though held by the masters of international law, from SUAREZ downwards, we have, it must be confessed, been somewhat slow to understand and take advantage of. And this jealousy of our sovereignty, and the attendant unwillingness to do aught that might seem to recognize the rebels even by implication -- a spirit shared to some extent by the Government as well as by the people -- have proved no inconsiderable drawback to an efficient conduct of the war. But the potent education of events has not been without avail. Henceforth woe put forth all our strength unweakened by any such pedantic legal limitations. Whatever belligerent rights it may be conducive to the great end of the war to employ, them we may freely put forth. The rights of sovercignty meanwhile reside in the United States, where they have been from the beginning and where they shall continue to be. And while in our sovereign capacity we may show toward those misguided men who have lifted up their hands against their country all needed forbearance -- while we make the war what Mr. SEWARD at its outbreak announced in his diplomatic correspondence that it should be,  An example of moderation and generosity such as history does not show the like of;  it is our own fault if we do not call out all the means that can give unity, energy and success to the work of putting down utterly the rebellion.

            "input": "text:Jonathan Lethem's dazzling but fundamentally flawed new novel, ''The Fortress of Solitude,'' is at once wildly ambitious and quietly intimate. It aspires to the social range and reach of John Updike's Rabbit novels and Michael Chabon's 2000 novel, ''The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay,'' but it also resonates with the personal, confessional tone of ''Catcher in the Rye.'' It borrows contemporary riffs from sources like Eminem's ''8 Mile'' and Nick Hornby's ''High Fidelity,'' but at the same time tries to frame its coming of age story with coy, Coover-esque allegories and high jinks.  This last element is a vestige of the postmodernist techniques this author used in earlier works like ''Girl in Landscape'' and ''Motherless Brooklyn,'' which mixed genre conventions, surreal special effects and playful deconstructions to create clever but somewhat aloof narratives. In this case it yields a series of unconvincing and weirdly forced passages that break the spell that Mr. Lethem has so assiduously created in the remainder of the novel.  It is a testament to his sheer verve as a writer and the acuity of his social and psychological observations that the novel as a whole manages to override these awkward interludes in which the hero and his best friend (as both children and adults) play at being superheroes, using a special ring to invoke magical powers of invisibility.  Happily, the bulk of ''The Fortress of Solitude'' -- which takes its title from Superman's arctic retreat -- avoids such cutesy pyrotechnics to focus on the story of Dylan Ebdus's coming of age. This is a story about fathers and sons, about best friends who grow apart, about the nervous subtext of race as it has played out in American society in the last three decades, and it demonstrates that Mr. Lethem does not need the tricked-up narrative strategies of his earlier books to hold the reader's attention. More important, it attests to a new virtuosity on his part: an ability to conjure disparate worlds from Brooklyn to Berkeley to Hollywood with uncommon energy and skill, as well as an ability to map the bumpy terrain of childhood and adolescence with humor and compassion and seemingly total recall for the enthusiasms and humiliations of those years.  Dylan Ebdus, we learn, grows up in the 1970's on Dean Street in the Gowanus section of Brooklyn. His father, Abraham, is an eccentric and reclusive artist who spends most of his time in an upstairs studio working on an experimental film that may never see the light of day; his mother, Rachel, is a manic and possibly mad hippie, who one day abruptly picks up and leaves to traipse around the country with a boyfriend.  His mother, Dylan recalls, made a stupid, beautiful and very American mistake: she cast him in the honorable role of ''a whiteboy integrating public schools.'' But those schools, he adds, ''were just then being abandoned'' and becoming ''rehearsals for prison,'' and the daily reality of Dylan's boyhood was often one of hunched trepidation. One of the few white children in his neighborhood, Dylan was routinely mocked and hassled: he took to carrying his money in his shoes, with some spare ''mugging money'' in a pocket to pay off would-be assailants. Halloween was an annual ordeal to be endured, and school another gantlet to be run.  Throughout Dylan's boyhood his idol and sometime protector was Mingus Rude, the ultracool son of a once famous black musician, who lived down the street. Whether he's playing ball or simply hanging out with the other kids on the block, Mingus radiates a laconic perfection. He turns Dylan on to comic books and the hit-and-run art of graffiti, and the pair soon develop a shared obsession with a mysterious ring acquired from a homeless man who believed he could fly; in the boys' fantasies the ring has the power to transform them into Aeroman, a superhero who helps thwart crime.  Despite the dubious Aeroman passages that pop up throughout this novel, Mr. Lethem does a magical job of conjuring up Dylan's day-to-day life: the multiple worlds that children inhabit -- at home, at school, on the street -- each world segregated from the other, each defined by unalterable codes and freighted with desperately guarded secrets.  There is a stereoscopic vision to the author's portrait of Dylan's Brooklyn: Mr. Lethem captures with perfect pitch the grunginess and fear of the boy's life, the undertow of anxiety that constantly tugs at him; but he also captures the adrenaline rush of the city, its tumult of change and changing expectations, as gangs and gentrification vie for ascendancy on Dean Street, and hip-hop, cocaine and punk music begin to permeate teenagers' lives.  Mr. Lethem, guest editor of ''The Year's Best Music Writing 2002,'' writes about music with enormous authority and ardor, and he uses it to chronicle the lives of Dylan and his friends, and of their parents. In giving us a soundtrack for their lives, he also limns the changing spirit of the nation, as R&B and rock gave way to hip-hop, as the lines between white and black music converged and blurred.  Dylan will grow up to become a music writer, too. But while he sees his love of music as a way to keep in touch with his roots, it provides him with a way to intellectualize his past. Having left Brooklyn to go to college -- first to an artsy New England campus, later to Berkeley -- Dylan is deeply conflicted about who he is and what he has left behind. He maintains a cordial distance from his father and loses touch with Mingus, who has spent many years in and out of prison. Dylan's belated decision to return home will spur him to try to come to terms with the childhood he has tried to escape and the past and people he has left behind.  Although the ending of ''The Fortress of Solitude'' is contrived and melodramatic -- full of annoying Aeroman asides and pretentious efforts to turn the adventures of Dylan and Mingus into a mythic ballad of lost hopes -- the novel's hold on the reader's imagination is strong enough to overpower this conclusion's tinny echoes.  Mr. Lethem has written a novel with many defects, but a novel that nonetheless attests to his potent storytelling talents. Summary: THE FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE  By Jonathan Lethem  511 pages. Doubleday. $26.      Jonathan Lethem's dazzling but fundamentally flawed new novel, ''The Fortress of Solitude,'' is at once wildly ambitious and quietly intimate. It aspires to the social range and reach of John Updike's Rabbit novels and Michael Chabon's 2000 novel, ''The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay,'' but it also resonates with the personal, confessional tone of ''Catcher in the Rye.'' It borrows contemporary riffs from sources like Eminem's ''8 Mile'' and Nick Hornby's ''High Fidelity,'' but at the same time tries to frame its coming of age story with coy, Coover-esque allegories and high jinks.",

Like those golden aged movies, the characters aren 2019t very deep and there 2019s a trite and superficial love story, but boy is this George Lucas-produced film replete with bravado and astounding aerial combat scenes.  The Tuskegee Airmen were 13 African Americans who were trained as pilots to fight for the Allied Forces, but they were heavily discriminated against by the military, and told they lacked the intelligence to man aircraft or fly for their country.  201cRed Tails 201d tells the heroic story of these men who fought in the face of bigotry and flew countless missions in Europe which helped bring about Allied victories over Germany.  Where  201cRed Tails 201d soars is with the spectacular aerial dogfights. Ben Burtt 2019s sound design and the incredible photography and special effects create realistic and phenomenal sky battles. Each mission is more intense and suspenseful than the previous. Every time the men take off in their red-tailed Mustangs you 2019ll be on the edge of your seat.   201cRed Tails 201d boasts fine performances from the ensemble, especially David Oyelowo ( 201cThe Help 201d) as obstinate Joe  2018Lightning 2019 Little. Terrence Howard also packs some punches as the Colonel who comes face-to-face with the white opposition.  Unfortunately the character development is mediocre. The bonds between the airmen are superficial at best and the love story between Little and the young Italian belle Sophia (Daniela Ruah) is flimsy and unnecessary. But you 2019ll be hard-pressed not to cheer as the airmen take down both the Nazis and put their bigoted commanding officers in their place. There 2019s a huge helping of cheesy dialogue, especially from the cartoonish Nazis, and a few rousing speeches, but in the end it 2019s all about the battle scenes.  George Lucas claims to be retiring from film making after producing  201cRed Tails 201d and if this film is his swan song, he could have gone out on much worse.

            "input": "text:AN FRANCISCO, Nov. 3 - California voters approved a ballot measure on Tuesday to spend $3 billion over the next 10 years on research of human embryonic stem cells, the largest state-run scientific research effort in the country.  Unofficial results showed the measure passed with 59 percent of the vote.  The measure, Proposition 71, was backed by an assortment of wealthy business people, Hollywood personalities, scientists and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, who broke ranks with President Bush and the California Republican Party on the contentious issue.  The Bush administration has placed restrictions on using public money for research on embryonic stem cells, citing opposition to the destruction of human embryos. Last year, the federal government spent $25 million on stem cell studies; with the passage of Proposition 71, California will spend $300 million a year beginning in 2005.  The measure calls for the establishment of the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, which is expected to become the nation's incubator for stem cell studies. The state will pay for the effort by issuing $3 billion in general obligation bonds at an estimated cost of $6 billion over the next 30 years.  Though there is disagreement over the use of human embryos for research, many scientists and patient advocacy groups say they believe stem cells have great potential for deriving therapies and cures for diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.  Voters in California, where legislating by initiative has been a long established practice, had 15 other measures on the ballot, the most of any state. They covered such subjects as relaxing the state's  three strikes  law for repeat offenders and establishing a mandatory  pay or play  system of health coverage for certain employers. Both measures were defeated.  Nationwide, voters in 34 states considered a total of 163 statewide ballot measures, approving or rejecting new laws on taxation, gambling, hunting, health care, immigration, election reform and a host of other subjects.  In Arizona, immigration was the topic of a fiercely contested measure that was approved with 56 percent of the vote. The measure, Proposition 200, requires proof of citizenship when registering to vote and denies certain state and local benefits to illegal immigrants.  Opponents are expected to mount legal challenges to the law. That was the case in California, when a similar measure passed 10 years ago but was struck down in the courts.  Several states had ballot measures dealing with marijuana. Montana voted to legalize marijuana for medicinal purposes, and Oregon turned down a proposal to expand its uses of medical marijuana. In Alaska, voters rejected a measure that would have legalized marijuana use for those over 21, with 57 percent opposed. Hunting and sportsmen groups fought back efforts in both Alaska and Maine to place restrictions on the use of bait in bear hunting.  In Florida, a constitutional amendment related to abortion and teenage pregnancy won handily with 65 percent of the vote. The law limits the privacy rights of girls under 18, paving the way for parental notification before a minor has an abortion.  Several states had measures dealing with election changes. In Arkansas, voters rejected Amendment 1, which called for extending term limits for state legislators to 12 years from 6 years. In California, voters turned down a measure that would have replaced party primaries with open primaries, while voters in Washington approved a modified open primary system.  Mr. Schwarzenegger took a particular interest in 10 of the California initiatives, though he was not the author of any of them, unlike the budget-related measures on the ballot in March.  The governor spent the final days before the election traversing the state, with his stated priority the defeat of two competing measures that would allow the expansion of casino-style gambling. The two measures were defeated by big margins.  On crime, Californians defeated a measure that would have limited the state's three-strikes law. Summary: The measure was backed by an assortment of wealthy business people, Hollywood personalities, scientists and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican.",

The Bank has not lent to Myanmar since 1987, the year before the military junta bloodily suppressed a popular uprising, and led the country into even greater international isolation.  Ever since, America has blocked new World Bank lending. Now that Myanmar has a notionally civilian government, and Aung San Suu Kyi, the opposition leader, has been freed from detention and sits in parliament, the talk is all of economic and political reform, and of hope that Myanmar 2019s unfortunate people might escape both the desperate poverty the country has suffered, and political repression as severe as anywhere outside North Korea.  So it was an unfortunate coincidence that August 1st also saw the publication of a report that raises serious questions about whether, in the fundamental brutality of its rulers, Myanmar has changed much at all. Human Rights Watch, a monitoring and lobbying group, interviewed 57 people who lived through the dreadful ethnic violence in Myanmar 2019s Western state of Rakhine (formerly Arakan) in June.  The violence followed the alleged rape and murder in late May of a Buddhist woman by three members of the Muslim  201cRohingya 201d minority, of whom between 800,000 and 1m live in Rakhine. On June 3rd Buddhist villagers attacked a bus and killed ten Muslim passengers. The police stood by and watched.  The cycle of ethnic retaliation worsened. Dozens died. Still the authorities intervened at best lackadaisically. The title of the Human Rights Watch report is  201cThe Government could have stopped this 201d, quoting the identical words uttered by two interviewees, one Buddhist, one Muslim. Specifically, it is the security forces that are accused of perpetrating crimes, including rape, murder and unjustified mass detention against Rohingyas, and of doing little to prevent the violence from escalating.  Few in Myanmar accept that the Rohingyas are true Burmese, although many they have lived in Myanmar for generations. Rather they are subject to racial discrimination as  201cBengalis 201d, and, under a 1982 law, are denied citizenship.  Analysts in Myanmar speculate that senior generals might have had reasons for letting the violence spread: that the carnage showed the need for a strong army; and that it would embarrass Thein Sein, the reformist president, as well as Miss Suu Kyi, as she toured Europe shortly afterwards.  No Burmese politician will gain kudos for backing the Rohingyas. Mr Thein Sein 2019s solution to the problem they pose was alarmingly candid:  201cWe will send them away if any third country would accept them. 201d Miss Suu Kyi, asked if the Rohingyas are Burmese citizens, was at least more cautious in her reply. She said she did not know. Other, heroic, freed political prisoners, were even less sympathetic.  Yet the Rohingyas' plight is horrific. The report estimates that over 100,000 have been displaced by the unrest. Many are in grim, unhealthy camps. Rakhine 2019s capital, Sittwe, once a mixed city, is now almost wholly Buddhist. And some of the Rohingyas who tried to escape to neighbouring Bangladesh, where some 250,000 took refuge in 1991. But Bangladesh has turned some back, flouting international law, according to Human Rights Watch. Nobody wants the Rohingyas. Last year Thailand faced criticism for sending some Rohingya boat people back out to sea.  There is so much justified excitement about Myanmar 2019s reforms and emergence, that the chances the Rohingyas 2019 suffering will be taken seriously are even lower than usual. But it is hard to quibble with the analysis of Brad Adams, Human Rights Watch 2019s Asia director:  201cIf the atrocities in Arakan had happened before the government 2019s reform process started, the international reaction would have been swift and strong. But the international community appears to be blinded by a romantic narrative of sweeping change in Burma [Myanmar], signing new trade deals and lifting sanctions even while the abuses continue. 201d  Correction: The above article was amended on August 5th 2012 to correct an error.

Scotty McCreery,17, became the youngest singer ever to win Idol, taking the prize over rival Lauren Alaina, who's actually one year younger than he.  Over 122 million votes figured into the tally - at least according to unverifiable figures trumpeted by host Ryan Seacrest.  As usual, Wednesday night's event saved the big reveal for the final few minutes, bloating its two hour bulk with guest stars out to piggy back on a ratings collosus. This year's starry list included everyone from Lady Gaga to Beyonce to The Edge and Bono performing a song from  Spiderman.  Yet, the peak turned out to be finalist James Durbin in a screech-off with his own idols, Judas Priest.  While the two top singers Wednesday night may boast different genders, they honor the same genre: country. That augers well for the winner's potential as a recording artist.  Idol 's strongest selling champ to date - Carrie Underwood - caters exclusively to the Nashville sound.  Though McCreery had been favored to win for some time, in some ways his triumph Wednessday night represented an upset. Alaina came into Wednesday night's show with a late breaking advantage. On Wednesday night's final sing-off, all three judges - J.Lo, Steven Tyler and Randy Jackson - leaned towards her side. More, Alaina came armed with a triumph-over-adversity story. She lost her voice during Tuesday afternoon's rehearsals, only to regain it through the wonders of modern medicine for the final face-down.  To boot, Alaina owns the bigger voice - one which actually recalls the iron-lunged Underwood. By contrast, McCreery's strength lies in his velvety tone and deep pitch rather than his ample lungs.  Then again, McCreery had never been considered for elimination in a given week, while Alaina had.  Idol  itself can be considered a winner this year. While many pundits had left it for dead after the departure of its star meanie Simon Cowell, plus its decline in ratings of ten percent over the previous year, this year's ratings ticked up 4 percent. With an average of 24.9 million viewers, it remains TV's most watched show.  That was hardly a sure thing this season, considering the introduction of two untested judges: J.Lo and Tyler. But the star power of both turned out to be a boon. It also helped that they switched the tone of the panel from judgement to mentoring, thereby purifying the show's cornfed character.  What could be more country than that? Summary: The country boy beat the county girl for this year's  American Idol  title Wednesday night.

Instead, Holland, who came to Everett in 1994 as a war refugee, wanted to highlight qualities of the Bosnian people often lost in news reports: creativity, artistry, talent, perseverance.   201cI didn 2019t want to do something showing the war and destruction. People know about that. I wanted to do something with art, to show that something as disruptive as war couldn 2019t kill our creative spirit, 201d said Holland, who left Boston in 1998 for Southern California and in 2010 opened a Laguna Beach art gallery specializing in green and sustainable art.  So Holland,42, started querying Bosnian artist friends about an exhibit, and received  201cpassionate 201d responses. The result is  201cBosnian Born, 201d an exhibit of nearly 50 pieces by 27 artists including photography, fashion design, sculpture, graphic design, and contemporary art. Most of the artists live in the United States, a few are in Bosnia-Herzogovina or elsewhere in Europe, but all were born in Bosnia.  The exhibit runs through Jan. 15 in a space at 38 Newbury St. offered by the American Islamic Congress, a civil rights organization that promotes tolerance and the exchange of ideas. The artworks are for sale, with proceeds going to the artists and to the Bosana Foundation, a charity that provides scholarships to Bosnian war orphans. About $8,0, enough for three partial scholarships, has been raised so far.  Organizers hope to raise more at a Dec. 13 reception honoring four locals who have been active in Bosnian relief and social justice efforts: Thomas Butler, founder of Builders for Peace; Mirjana Rabadzija, who helped resettle Bosnian refugees during the war; Andras Riedlmayer, who testified at an international war crimes tribunal about cultural destruction during the war; and Glenn Ruga, founder of the Center for Balkan Development. The reception, at 6:30 at the American Islamic Congress, is open to the public.   201cBosnian Born 201d premiered in May at Holland 2019s California gallery and came to Boston with the help of fellow Bosnian refugees living in the city. It brings together artists whose work is being recognized in its own right, far outside of Bosnia.  Consider fashion designer Ina Soltani, who was 17 and on an exchange program in Los Angeles when the war broke out in 1992. She couldn 2019t return to her family in Sarajevo, which was besieged by Serbian forces. They were reunited when the war ended, but Soltani returned to California to study fashion and start her own label, and has made dresses worn by Jessica Biel, Miley Cyrus, Eva Longoria, Jennifer Lopez, Katy Perry, Kristen Stewart, and Carrie Underwood, among others. One of her designs, a short pink dress, is part of  201cBosnian Born. 201d  Sarajevo-born Dean Zulich took up photography only recently, but has quickly gained notice, with work appearing in Marie Claire and Playboy, and as runner-up on VH1 2019s photographer-competition show  201cThe Shot. 201d His contribution to  201cBosnian Born 201d is the surrealistic  201cMask 1, 201d taken at the Salton Sea in Southern California.   201cEach one of these artists  2014 their story is related to Bosnia. The war is part of that, but it 2019s also about survival, and staying human, 201d said Ria Kulenovic, who left Bosnia in 1995 and came to Boston, where she became friends with Holland. Kulenovic belongs to the recently founded New England Friends of Bosnia and Herzogovina, and helped bring the exhibit to Boston.  It 2019s a notion understood by Harun Mehmedinovic, who was born in Sarajevo, in 1982. His family fled their neighborhood after it was captured by Serbian forces, and were taken in for several months by artists Seyo Cizmic and Kemal Hadzic, who became refugees themselves, and whose art is also part of  201cBosnian Born. 201d  Mehmedinovic 2019s image  201cHailstorm, 201d of a young woman in a white dress walking through a landscape whitened by hail, is playful and serene.   201cIt 2019s about living in the present, 201d said Mehmedinovic.  201cIt 2019s an appropriate image for people who survived the war in Bosnia. . . . You 2019re more likely to do something kind of crazy if you 2019ve been through war. 201d  The war left more than 100,000 Bosnians dead, most of them civilians, and drove another million from their homes. While  201cBosnian Born 201d is intended to celebrate the human spirit, the artists acknowledge that they have been shaped by the war.   201cI still remember the smell of blood in the air, 201d said Cizmic.  201cI know that influenced me for sure. 2019 2019 Cizmic 2019s piece in the exhibit,  201cSecret Code, 201d features Hebrew letters in a grid on a gold background, and is about the suffering of different peoples through history.  The organizers said that it was important to them, at a time when ethnic tensions still roil Bosnia, to include artists from all of Bosnia 2019s ethnic groups. They also said the exhibit has attracted Bosnian, Croat, and Serb visitors, fostering friendlier relations.   201cI think we 2019ve succeeded in doing what Bosnia needed to do, 201d said Kulenovic, of New England Friends of Boston and Herzegovina.  Azra Aksamija, an art professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology who fled Bosnia in 1992, believes artists can foster pluralism in Bosnia as they did centuries ago, when Christian and Muslim craftsmen helped build each other 2019s houses of worship.   201cThere are still people who buy into nationalistic propaganda, and this is where artists can play a role, by showing how we are shaped by crosscultural influences, 201d Aksamija said.  The exhibit will go next to Washington, D.C., while there are talks about bringing it to St. Louis and Burlington, Vt., home to two of the country 2019s biggest Bosnian communities.

This display, which Curtis promises will stay in place for a long time (overturning another Tate tradition, the regular rehang) abounds in masterpieces, curiosities and discoveries. All the treasures are on view, from William Hogarth's painting of his servants to David Hockney's A Bigger Splash, from Francis Bacon's 1972 Triptych of George Dyer's suicide to a cheerful group portrait of Mr Oldham and his Guests enjoying their pipes painted by Joseph Highmore in the 18th century.  The famous and the forgotten hang side by side in chronological order. This display glories in the advantages a straight chronological arrangement has over curatorial  interventions . Arranging art in order of when it was made does not impose anything on the visitor. It gives everyone the freedom to see connections, make comparisons, and lose themselves.  Obviously you don't really have to walk it in order, from Hans Holbein to Richard Wright. You can flit around as you like. But in each gallery, there is a deep and rich sampling of a particular moment in British art. The early galleries have an unexpected star  2013 Sir Joshua Reynolds. In the late 18th century this painter, theorist and first president of the Royal Academy dominated the British art world. Nowadays he is often thought of as a bit tedious compared with his brilliant contemporary Joseph Wright of Derby, say. But here his masterpiece The Archers, two youths arcing and straining athletically as they fire their arrows, hangs between Wright's fiery forge and erupting volcano  2013 and wins the face-off.  It's the kind of surprise that makes A Walk Through British Art a total delight. In later rooms, Eduardo Paolozzi's sci-fi collages compete with Bill Brandt's nude photographs, Sarah Lucas with Richard Hamilton.  Yet what truly stands out, from the sensitive choices of real gems of artworks to their spacious yet detailed placing in sumptuously redecorated galleries, is the passion for British art that fuels this epic display. It makes the case for British art, not just today but since the 1500s, as abounding in originality, ripe with personality, and often unexpectedly beautiful. It is a revelatory journey to meet the British. Summary: More paintings and sculptures go on show as part of rethink of how permanent collection is displayed",

California waitress Chelsea Roff raised her little sister on her own, battled an eating disorder and ran   2013 and her bosses wanted to go the extra mile to show their appreciation. With the help of  , they organized a heartwarming stunt for Roff on April Fools' Day. As she worked her shift, random customers appeared and gave her a series of incredible tips, culminating with a gig teaching yoga at a eating disorder treatment clinic and a brand-new car.  When her son came down with a serious illness, Arizona's Danielle Thomas started waiting tables  2013 the flexible hours meant she'd have more time to take care of him  2013 and signed up for food stamps to make up for the low wages. But when Thomas tried to renew her benefits, the government told her that they'd mistakenly overpaid her; suddenly she owed them $800 she didn't have. While telling her story to a table one night, she received an unexpected stroke of luck: A $1,000 tip from a kind-hearted customer, enough for her to repay the debt.  In January, two anonymous patrons walked into a Nebraska Cracker Barrel and requested they be served by the grumpiest server on duty. Not wanting to throw any shade on a member of their staff, the Cracker Barrel's management instead gave them their happiest waitress: college freshman Abigail Sailors, who was working her way through Trinity College after a childhood filled with grief and abuse. One of the patrons happened to be a Trinity alum and, inspired by Sailors's fortitude through tragedy, left her a $6,000 tip  2013 $5,000 for tuition, $1,000 for school supplies.  The happiest event to ever occur in an airport restaurant happened in April, when passenger Heather Hogan received news that her beagle had successfully made it through a life-saving surgery.

Before he died in 2012, Aaron Collins had   2013 that they honor his memory through a series of  awesome  $500 tips. The family didn't have enough money to make his dream a reality, so they set up  where strangers could donate money for the project. It worked even better than they expected.

The Sky News reporter filmed rifling through an infant victim's luggage at the MH17 crash site has penned a lengthy apology published by The Guardian.  In the piece, Londoner Colin Brazier explained how he came to pick up the child's belongings live on air  2013 and the tears that followed.   While presenting Sky's lunchtime coverage of the flight MH17 disaster, I stooped down to look at a piece of debris. It was a child's suitcase,  he wrote.   I put my hand inside and lifted up a water bottle and a set of keys. As I did so my mental circuit-breaker finally engaged and I apologised instantly on-air for what I was doing.   But the damage was already done, with the veteran journalist and father-of-six having intricately described the case's contents, everyday items serving a devastating reminder of the young life lost.  Within minutes social media was alight with outrage.  July 22, 2014: A man believed to be a pro-Russian rebel fighter has appeared in an online video purportedly taking a ring belonging to a MH17 passenger.  Within hours the story had gone viral, with Sky issuing an apology for the insensitive gaffe.  Brazier, who is no stranger to aviation disasters having covered the 2004 Lake Constance plane crash which claimed 69 lives  2013 45 of them children, stopped short of defending his actions, instead offering critics an alternative view.   The crash site of flight MH17 is like the set of a horror story. Except that movies are never allowed to show what we saw over the weekend,  he said.   As I type I can smell the nauseating scent of death that clings to me still. I have seen burned bodies before  2013 I was a 17-year-old football fan caught up in the Bradford football stadium fire  2013 but nothing on this scale.   Brazier said in the absence of law and order he had become so accustomed to, he, like many others, were free to walk around the eastern Ukraine crash site at will.  And in this particular broadcast, in a corpse-littered field, he stumbled across the intimate items.  July 22, 2014: Pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine have released footage to the BBC showing flight MH17 directly after it crashed.   They brought home the poignancy of the tragedy  2026 And so during that lunchtime broadcast I stood above a pile of belongings, pointing to items strewn across the ground,  he said.   Out of the corner of my eye I spotted a pink drinking flask. It looked familiar. My six-year-old daughter, Kitty, has one just like it.   I bent down and, what my Twitter critics cannot hear  2026 is that I had lost it.   Brazier said his employer understood the stress under which the error was made.  A statement issued by Sky following the incident appeared to support his claim, noting the  human tragedy of the event .   Colin immediately recognised that this was inappropriate and said so on air. Both Colin and Sky News apologise profusely for any offence caused,  the statement read.  It's unknown whether any action will be taken against Brazier.

            "input": "text:Calum Colvin's ambitious set of 25 new works revisits the mythical figure of Ossian, the  Celtic Homer .  Discovered  and published by James Macpherson in Fragments of Ancient Poetry (1760), Ossian, it later transpired, was Macpherson's invention, a fake whose poetry was stitched together from a variety of sources. That is the inspiration for Colvin's sweeping journey through Scottish cultural history that stops en route to pick up (among others) Robert Burns, Walter Scott, a tattooed Maori, Harry Lauder and the Old Firm, and explores themes of authenticity, fragmentation and fabrication.  Throughout the exhibition Colvin employs a characteristic technique: he builds three-dimensional models, projects images on to these constructions, traces the lines of these images as they fall across the various forms and objects they encounter, and then photographs the results. The final image (transferred to canvas here) relies heavily on a trompe l'oeil effect in which the two-dimensional integrity of drawn or painted images appears to remain intact, despite being fragmented and distributed across a variety of surfaces and locations.  Colvin's works, then, are a place where complicated subject matter meets complicated technical effects. But this is difficult to manage, and Colvin achieves mixed results. The series Fragments I-VIII and Blind Ossian I-IX show him at his best. In these compelling images, strong composition holds fastidious detail in check, encouraging close looking and agile thinking. But in works such as Cruthni I-III and, to a lesser extent, Scota 01, composition falters and busy detail wins out. Looking at these can be a slightly frustrating experience as details vie for attention, each loaded with  meaning  and  significance .  Sometimes it is difficult to assimilate all these littered details, formal arrangements, thematic concepts, historical references and technical intricacies. Sometimes fragments remain fragments. And finally, an atmosphere of airless nostalgia reigns. The urgency of the present is smothered by the overbearing presence of a mournful past.   00b7 Until February 9. Details: 0131-624 6200.

Photograph: Jack Taylor AFP Getty Images  Three friends have struck gold after a German artist buried thousands of pounds worth of bullion on a Folkestone beach.  Berlin-based Michael Sailstorfer has hidden 30 bars of 24-carat gold, worth  00a310,0, under the sand of the Outer Harbour beach in Folkestone as part of the town's triennial arts festival.  Kevin Wood, Kirsty Henderson and her sister Megan unearthed a  00a3500 piece on Friday after digging for an hour at low tide.  The friends had travelled from Canterbury after hearing about the gold rush on Twitter.  Describing the moment he got lucky, Wood,28, said:  My legs went from under me and I started shaking. I put it quietly in my pocket. We left the beach, and halfway home we pulled over for a drink.   On Thursday the Guardian prompted hundreds of gold diggers to head for the town by breaking the news that the conceptual artist had buried 30 bars of the precious metal, together worth  00a310,000.  A family from Folkestone dug up one of the bars at around 7pm on Thursday, the organisers of the project told the Guardian. There have been other rumoured finds since then, but these have yet to be confirmed.  The Folkestone Digs project is part of the town's triennial which has previously included work by artists including Tracey Emin, Jeremy Deller and Martin Creed.  Artists including Yoko Ono are taking part in this year's festival which runs from 30 August to 2 November.

PEOPLE has obtained 15 motions filed on Oct. 27 that will be argued in front of a judge next month. In one of the motions, Harris's attorney, Maddox Kilgore, argues that the murder charge should be dropped. He argues that the life sentence that Harris faces  is cruel and unusual if it is grossly out of proportion to the severity of the crime.   In another motion, Kilgore argues that Harris's interviews with police should be suppressed, claiming that Harris was not read his Miranda rights.  Statements to law enforcement officers were the result of custodial interrogation  00e2 0080 00a6 made without being properly advised of his rights,  he wrote.

According to Stoddard, Leanna asked him,  Did you say too much?   In one of the motions, Harris's attorney cites marital privilege and argues that those statements should be suppressed.

            "input": "text:WrestleMania III set the record for the largest attendance at a live indoor sporting event in North America. Held at the Pontiac Silverdome on March 29,1987, this edition of WrestleMania drew 93,173 fans. The card had 12 matches that featured all-time greats such as Randy Savage, Ricky Steamboat, Roddy Piper, Bret Hart, Harley Race, Rick Martel and the Iron Sheik. The main event was the colossal clash between Andre The Giant and Hulk Hogan. 30 Years Of WrestleMania takes a closer look at how this historic night for the WWE was devised and developed.  In preliminary discussions for the third WrestleMania, Vince McMahon was adamant that WWE make the event a bigger, more grandiose production than WrestleMania 2. Given the success of the previous two events, for WWE the question was,  How do we make WrestleMania better?  The first step was returning WrestleMania to one location. Marketing was also key. During an early meeting to brainstorm taglines, the WWE team threw around different possible catchphrases until someone said,  This one's going to be bigger, it's going to be better, and it's going to be badder.  Vince McMahon jumped from his chair and said,  Stop right there.  He began to draw it in the air with his hand,  WrestleMania III: Bigger, Better, Badder.  The  Better  and  Badder  aspects were an accepted mission statement in a company that hosted live events 52 weeks a year. The  Bigger 201d component required additional work. WrestleMania sold out Madison Square Garden. WrestleMania 2 emanated from three locations and drew over 40,000 fans, along with hundreds of thousands more via closed-circuit. What could WWE do to make WrestleMania III  Bigger?   WWE wanted WrestleMania III to be as close to the east coast as possible. While WWE was a national company by then, their strongest fan base was in the eastern half of the United States. The Pontiac Silverdome was quickly selected as first choice. Ed Cohen remembers,  The phone rang at two in the morning. I was asleep, so my answering machine picked up. Vince started talking fast, saying,  2018Wake up! Ed, wake up!' I got on a plane to Michigan that morning with a check for $50,000 in my hand to hold the date for the Silverdome.   Selling 60,000 seats would have produced the largest crowd in WWE history, but the Silverdome could hold more than 90,000 spectators. To fill its seats, WWE needed the best talent combined with a breakthrough promotional campaign.  The Pontiac Silverdome could be configured for various seating arrangements. When asked which configuration he wanted to use, Vince McMahon replied,  The whole way, we are going to break the all-time indoor attendance record. It 2019s going to be over 90,000 people.   Hulk Hogan added,  Haven't you heard who 2019s in the main event, brother?   WrestleMania III rested on the public's connection with Hulk Hogan and Andre the Giant. Crossing into 1987, Hogan became a household name and the industry 2019s most recognizable ambassador.  Throughout his career, Andre the Giant was the greatest attraction the industry had ever known. But heading into the mid-1980s, Andre 2019s body started to suffer the rigors of the business. He felt it was time to wind down his in-ring career. For WrestleMania III to fulfill its mission, Andre would have to agree to participate. Vince McMahon remembers,  201cRight after WrestleMania 2, I flew to England to visit Andre. He was filming The Princess Bride. He was suffering from excruciating back pain and needed surgery. Originally, he wasn't going to have the surgery but I convinced him to have it and be a part of this one last thing. I told him, 'You and Hogan will draw the biggest crowd ever for an event like this.' And he agreed.   To account for Andre 2019s post-surgery absence, WWE issued a statement saying that he had been suspended for not fulfilling certain contractual obligations. Very few people knew at the time that Andre was recovering at the McMahon family home in Greenwich, Connecticut.  The buildup to WrestleMania III 2019s main event started on the January 17,1987, episode of Piper's Pit. Hogan and Andre received awards from then-WWE President Jack Tunney. Andre took the first step toward the historic encounter by leaving in the midst of Hogan 2019s acceptance speech. Roddy Piper remembers,  The Andre and Hogan segments were done in the Pit because WWE needed the three biggest properties -- Andre, Hogan, and Piper -- together to get the storyline over with the fans. I needed the crowd to focus because this was serious.   Over the next two weeks, WWE personalities who had credibility with the audience as  knowing  Andre speculated on his uncharacteristic behavior. On February 7, the Piper 2019s Pit audience gasped when Andre appeared with Bobby  The Brain  Heenan. Staring at Hulk Hogan, Andre challenged the Hulkster to a match at WrestleMania III. To dramatize Andre's transformation to a life of evil, he tore off Hogan's shirt and cross, and blood ran down the WWE Champion's chest. The segment ended with Piper consoling Hogan in one of sports-entertainment television's most memorable moments.  Turning Andre into a villain created the ultimate showdown and maximized WrestleMania III's drawing power.  It took Hulk and Andre a long time to reach a point of mutual friendship and respect. Hulk Hogan recalls,  I'd be on the way to the building, knowing I had to wrestle [Andre], and I was so scared that I would pull the car over and vomit.  However, Andre gained respect for Hogan in Japan. Hogan faced a tough situation with a wrestler named Tatsumi Fujinami who would have seriously injured Hogan if he could. When the Hulkster claimed the victory despite the challenging circumstances, Andre saw the skill Hogan displayed in the ring. Hogan said of his relationship with Andre,  201cI think, after that night, things changed.   Despite the collaboration the main event required from Hulk Hogan and Andre the Giant, there was uncertainty up until the last minute. It was crucial that Andre allow two things: the bodyslam and the ultimate defeat. Vince McMahon reflects,  It's funny because Hogan was scared to death. Hogan had been in the ring with [Andre] before, but not like this. Andre had this habit with anyone of consequence as far as size was concerned; he had to show them who was boss. [Hogan] wasn 2019t too sure if the result would come out like he thought it would. I knew what Andre was going to do; Hogan knew what Andre could do. Big difference.   Hulk Hogan entered the Silverdome to the deafening roar of his Hulkamaniacs. The Hulkster and Andre the Giant traded displays of power and dominance, each move eliciting outcries from the record crowd. Then Hulk Hogan performed the unimaginable. He slammed  The Eighth Wonder of the World  and pinned him with his famous Leg Drop. In the act of defeat, Andre the Giant showed his love for the business that made him an icon. McMahon recalls,  201cThat was the highest moment that Andre would ever have in the business. He was so proud of that. Even in his later days, when he could hardly move in the ring, he lived off of that, and he should have.   WrestleMania III sold more tickets than the Super Bowl, and WWE was now the undisputed owner of the indoor attendance record. As the show came to a close, WWE, Hulk Hogan, and Andre the Giant crossed the threshold of entertainment immortality together.  -- Excerpted by permission from 30 Years Of WrestleMania by Brian Shields and Dean Miller.

            "input": "text:FORTUNE  2014 Sidecar CEO Sunil Paul said yesterday at a conference that U.S. auto ownership will be cut in half over the next decade thanks to social car-sharing services like his. It sounds ludicrous for any number of socio-demographic reasons, but what if you allow yourself to drink the battery fluid? What would the rise of companies like Sidecar mean for the country?  Less traffic? Likely. A cleaner environment? Probably. A massive cut in state tax revenues. Definitely.  According to an April study by the Center for Automotive Research, the auto sector was responsible for approximately $91.5 billion in state taxes for 2010  2014 or around 13% of all such receipts. Included in that figure was $30 billion from the sale of new and used vehicles and $20 billion from vehicle registration fees. Not included were such things as excise taxes or title fees.  The U.S. Department of Transportation reports that 51.2% of new cars in 2010 was for personal use, so let 2019s just use that figure even though the percentage of personal-use used cars is likely even higher.  That means that, if Paul 2019s theory is correct, states would lose out on a minimum of 3.4% in annual tax revenue, or $23.4 billion in 2010 dollars. Not too good for those states that already are having trouble making budgetary ends meet (i.e., almost all of them). And that doesn 2019t even take into account what would be lost from the $43 billion in federal revenue generated by federal fuel taxes and taxes on direct employment at car manufacturers, auto parts suppliers and dealers (or the resulting unemployment costs).  Now I know what you may be thinking: Won 2019t some of that lost revenue be recouped from taxes collected on drivers for companies like Sidecar? Under the current structure, the answer would be no.  Sidecar views itself an an intermediary rather than an employer, so it doesn 2019t issue 1099 2019s or any other tax forms to its drivers. In fact, Sidecar doesn 2019t even view its client transactions as payments  2014 it calls them donations. So does fellow ride-sharing company Lyft, although it does issue 1099 2019s for drivers who reach over $20,000 and 200  201cdonations 201d in a given year.  Maybe all social ride-sharing drivers will accurately report all applicable taxes to state and local authorities, but it 2019s highly unlikely. After all, you know any restaurant servers or bartenders who report 100% of their tips? Me neither, and they work in an industry that 2019s been around longer than the country itself.  To be sure, there are all sorts of social and environmental benefits to car-sharing specifically, and to the larger notion of a sharing economy. But there also are significant national costs to decreased ownership of major goods like automobiles. At the very least, Paul and other sharing economy evangelists should be aware of both sides of the equation.

With auto-play videos now being a firmly established part of the Facebook FB News Feed, the social network is reportedly planning to try upping the quality of the ads displayed there. A new ad format called a cinemagraph will reportedly start appearing in the News Feed soon, according to Adweek.  The ads are moving GIFs, but the motion is restrained to just a few parts of the image. An ad for wine might show a large banquet table with just a single glass of wine swirling, for instance. Or an ad for a newspaper might show a reader slowly stirring his coffee while everything else around it is static. An agency that 2019s been experimenting heavily with cinemagraphs, Ann Street Studio, features several of the ads on their website.  The ads have a dreamy, hypnotic quality that makes them stand out amongst the multimedia assault most users experience as they surf the Web. Most likely, these types of ads would be played on loop, a functionality that Facebook just added to Instagram last week.

The company, whose portfolio of products ranges from V8 juice to Pepperidge Farm cake to its namesake soups, has found itself grappling with big changes in consumer behavior, in particular growing interest in fresh food and consumers much more keen to know what impact what they 2019re eating is having on their health and where it 2019s from.  On top of that has been a  201cmounting distrust of so-called Big Food, the large food companies and legacy brands on which millions of consumers have relied on for so long, 201d Campbell CEO Denise Morrison said on Wednesday at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York meeting in New York.   201cLike other companies in our industry, we 2019re contending with now not just the long-term impact of the Great Recession on consumer purchasing behavior, or the increasingly complex public dialog when it comes to food, or the regulatory environment for food. 201d What 2019s more, the traditional avenue for selling Campbell 2019s products 2014grocery stores 2014are coming under a lot of pressure from alternative retailers she said.  Campbell recently lowered its full-year results forecast after only one quarter, suggesting it doesn 2019t expect much relief in the pressure on its profit margins anytime soon. In January, Campbell said it would re-organize its divisions according to product category, rather than by geographic region. It plans to eliminate some management layers as well. Campbell estimates its cost-cutting measures will save it $200 million a year.  Campbell is by no means the only food maker struggling to adapt to new consumer behavior. Last week, cereal maker Kellogg K cut its long-term annual revenue growth estimate to a range of 1% to 3%, excluding some items, from an earlier forecast of 3% to 4%, citing poor cereal and snacks sales.  Morrison 2019s comments about adapting to changing consumer attitudes echoed those of a major competitor.  201cI don 2019t think Kraft has done as aggressive of a job in this regard as we need to, 201d said John Cahill, who in December became CEO of Kraft Foods KRFT , last week. He noted that Kraft has lost market share in 40% of its U.S. businesses in 2014. Also last week, ConAgra, CAG the maker of Chef Boyardee, announced it was naming a new CEO 2014the ex chief at Hillshire Brands, Sean Connolly 2014and lowered its earnings guidance for the year ending in May.  All this turmoil is enough to give any food executive indigestion.

What precise role McIlvaine played in hiring Fisher couldn 2019t be learned. It is unusual at HP, or any large company, for a series of top-level gatherings to be coordinated by the office of the CEO, as opposed to a corporate marketing group that does this sort of thing frequently.

He treated me like a princess and spoiled me rotten,  says Sarah Verbeek,26, who dated Sachs for one year after the two met in a sign language class at Saddleback College in Mission Viejo, California.   He was the funniest person I ever knew in my whole life  2013 we would go to the grocery store and dance down the aisles,  Verbeek tells PEOPLE in  And although Verbeek says she sometimes observed underlying tensions between Sachs a 19-year-old computer whiz and onetime honors student, and his parents Brad,57, and Andra,54, she also says that it wasn't something he dwelled on.   He never spoke bad about his family,  Verbeek says.  He never said, 'I hate my mom.' Nothing.    The young couple dated for a year and broke up in the summer of 2013, after which a distraught Sachs attempted suicide by overdosing on pills. That fall, he moved to Seattle to attend community college.  Verbeek says they didn't talk again until she learned that his parents Brad and Andra, a self-made real estate mogul worth an estimated $80 million, had been  on Feb. 9,2014, in their $2.4 million San Juan Capistrano, California, home. His 8-year-old brother, Landon, had also been paralyzed in the deadly rampage.  She says she immediately emailed Sachs, asking if he needed someone to talk to.   He emailed me back a few hours later and said, 'I would love to talk to you. I don't really have anybody,'   she says.  For the next few weeks, Verbeek says she became Sachs's rock. She comforted him as he cried uncontrollably in the backseat of her car, listened to him as he talked about joining forces with his older brother, Myles, to get custody of his younger siblings, and supported him as he kept nightly vigils at Landon's hospital bedside.   He would cry and say, 'Landon is 8 years old and he doesn't have a dad,'   Verbeek says.  He seemed like he was genuinely grieving.   Less than a month later, Sachs was charged with the murders of his parents and the attempted murders of Landon and his 17-year-old sister Alexis, who was unharmed.  He later told investigators he blamed his parents for his messed-up life and said that he was their  least favorite child.   Verbeek is among those who remain baffled by his motives and what could have caused him to snap.   He never talked about guns or shooting guns,  she says.  This all came out of nowhere. He hid it very well.  Summary:  He never spoke bad about his family,  Sarah Verbeek tells PEOPLE",

            "input": "text:FORTUNE  2014 Unless you have just been ignoring your portfolio for the last few years, the fact that interest rates are literally at all-time lows should be no surprise. In the chart below we look at the yield on 10-year Treasuries going back 30 years. The yield on the 10-year Treasury hit an all-time low of 1.47% in July of this year.  For the last few years, many investors have become bearish on U.S. government bonds based on the extremely low yields. For those that have actually implemented the thesis and shorted U.S. government debt, the trade was likely painful. In reality, shorting U.S. government bonds has been the proverbial  201cwidow maker 201d trade over the past few years as bond prices have gone straight up and yields down.  Despite potential credit events, like the debt ceiling crisis in the summer of 2011 and a subsequent downgrade of U.S. government debt, yields on treasuries have continued to trend lower. The monetary policy implemented by the Federal Reserve has had the intended impact of keeping rates low and has, seemingly, made investors think that the Fed is the ultimate lender of last resort, albeit by printing money.  By keeping interest rates at abnormally low levels, not only has the Fed induced lower rates on U.S. government bonds, but it has also induced lower rates on many types of loans  2013 from mortgages to corporate debt. In the two charts below, we highlight this by looking at the rates on 30-year mortgages going back 10 years versus a high yield US corporate bond index.  In some markets, like the residential mortgage rate, low rates have not increased money supply because of tightening lending standards. Conversely, the high yield market is, as they say, flush with liquidity. Related to that last point, in October the U.S. high yield primary market hit $41.9 billion in issuance. This trailed only September 2019s all-time high of $46.8 billion. Yes, you read that correctly . . . September 2012 was the highest month of high yield issuance in the history of capital markets. As of October, this year is 34% ahead of 2011 2019s full-year total and up 52% year-over-year through ten months.  Clearly, low rates are inducing corporate issuers to refinance at record rates. In fact, in the year-to-date 59% of total issuance of high yield debt has been utilized for refinancing. This is a little less than the 64% of proceeds used for refinancing in 2010, although in 2010 55% of proceeds were used to address maturities versus only 43% this year. So, corporations are taking advantage of the low interest rates to reduce their all in cost of borrowing. In addition, these issuers are taking advantage of the search for yield by many investors to sell record amounts of bonds.  Morningstar published their most recent fund flows data for flows through October. In the year-to-date, high yield fund inflows are +$27.9 billion and + $30.1 billion in the last twelve months. High yield is the second largest inflow category in the last twelve months after intermediate term bonds. On a percentage basis, though, high yield has seen the largest inflow of any of Morningstar 2019s top 95 asset categories growing 15.2% year-over-year.  MORE: Economists poke holes in Buffett 2019s tax argument  The other interesting point relating to the high yield market -in addition to record low interest rates, record high issuance and record high yield fund inflows- is that terms for the issuers are almost as flexible as they have ever been. This is best characterized by the re-emergence of covenant-lite loans, or loans with much more lenient terms for borrowers. In the year-to-date, covenant-lite loan issuance is $49 billion. According to Fitch, the recovery rate for covenant-lite loans is 55  2013 60% versus an overall recovery rate of 62% for loans from 2008  2013 2009.  In aggregate, it seems like a frothy market for high yield, but high yield bulls would counter that the long term spread versus treasuries is not even close to its lows. Currently, this spread is at 5.7% versus its low of 2.5% in 2007.  While the spread versus Treasuries is an important metric, the underlying creditworthiness is probably even more critical, especially with high yield bond trading at their lowest absolute level ever. The caveat is that default rates are currently very low on high yield bonds. In fact, as of September the par weighted default rate, according to J.P. Morgan, fell to 1.83% and the issuer weighted default rate fell to 2.98%. This is well below the peak on par basis of 16.3% in November 2009 and the peak on an issuer basis of 12.2% in March 2002.  MORE: Debunking private equity 2019s debt  2018problem  The reality is that high yield bonds in aggregate are pricing in these low default rates. On absolute basis, high yield bonds are almost perfectly priced given their all-time lows in yield. So, investors are getting paid the lowest interest rate they have ever been paid to take the risk of owning high yield debt.  Our primary concern going forward relates to the corporate earnings and cash flow outlook. One of our fourth quarter themes is that corporate earnings growth is slowing. To the extent that corporate earnings and cash flow begin to decline year-over-year, this will have a direct impact on the ability of corporations to pay their interest rates on borrowing and adversely impact their overall credit worthiness.  In addition to the outlook for corporate earnings and cash flow, the other key red flag we see for high yield is that volatility for the asset class is starting to accelerate. By a recent estimate from ConvergEx Group, implied volatility for high yield bonds is up 64% in the last month. This comes even as yields for these bonds have continued to decline. Even if the high yield asset class is cheap on a relative basis, chasing high yield is far from a contrarian call at this point in the cycle, especially as corporate earnings look to be peaking.

            "input": "text:Nina Beier's work is as unstable as a keg of dynamite, if a whole lot quieter. The Danish artist's sparse, pared-down offerings have included fading photographs, a wall painting that was redone daily and a sculpture recreated via a game of Chinese whispers. Her Dust Painting is literally a pile of dust-coloured pigment, which gets traipsed all over the gallery on the soles of people's shoes. As unassuming as it first appears, her art is an elusive, restless thing, with scant regard for the beautiful picture frames that often attempt to contain it.  Until recently, Beier was best known for the work she made with fellow Dane Marie Lund. The duo's quirky interactive projects rewrote the unspoken rules of museum behaviour, from subtle changes such as getting a guard to grow his beard long to raucous disruptions where gallery-goers break the silence and vigorously applaud. In the past few years, however, she's increasingly put objects centre-stage  2013 albeit ones that have a habit of disappearing.  Always changing, eroding or being remade, Beier's creations give the lie to the stamp of permanence bestowed on artworks by frames, glass cases and gallery walls. Her works' origins can be equally hard to pin down. For her 2010 show within Art Basel Statements, the major art fair's special section for younger artists, Beier employed an actress to recreate a sculpture she'd destroyed, using nothing more than a verbal description of the lost work. Far from a straightforward bit of outsourcing, with the actress effectively playing the artist, it set off a tail-chasing game exploring artistic intent, originality and reproduction.  This is more than art about art, however: Beier's playful approach snares big, timeless themes, including loss, ageing and death. Shirts vs Skins, her current London show, stages a face-off between frail, mortal humanity and the objects we design to outlive us. It's a tragicomedy Beier delivers with the lightest of touches, as with her glass cabinet boasting a spare display of her retired father's recent golfing trophies. The Blues, a series of outmoded shots of hair models taken from a Copenhagen hairdresser, is particularly droll, full of tousled highlights and razor-cut slanting fringes. But these photographs are hardly frozen in time: long-term display in the salon window has drained the pictures' colour spectrums to washy blues. They're like a reverse Dorian Grey: portraits that age with their subjects.  Why we like her: For her series Fatigues, which looks like stain paintings in rolling blues and mauves. In fact they're sections of hardwearing, stain-resistant carpet, with the kind of eye-popping patterns familiar from tube seats and the foyers of public buildings, which the artist has submitted to strenuous chemical dyes.  Catch him if you can: One of Beier's hair models is none other than a teenage Leonardo Dicaprio.  Where Can I See Her? At Laura Bartlett Gallery, London WC1, until 31 March.

            "input": "text:Tracy Warner earned $37,000 a year at the Galesburg, Ill., Maytag factory. Years after the factory closed in 2004, she makes $21,000 from two jobs.  GALESBURG, Ill.  2014 Even in this city of abandoned factories, it is possible to see some of the benefits the United States reaps from increased foreign trade: at the rail yard, where boxcars of bargain-price Asian goods are routed to US consumers; at the nearby slaughterhouse, where pigs are packaged for the global market; and at Knox College, where almost 10 percent of the students now come from foreign countries.  It is also hard to miss the enduring costs. In 2004, Maytag shut down the refrigerator factory that for decades was Galesburg 2019s largest employer and moved much of the work to Mexico. Barack Obama, then running to represent Illinois in the Senate, described the Maytag workers as victims of globalization in his famous speech that year at the Democratic National Convention.  A decade later, many of those workers are still struggling. The city 2019s population is in decline, and the median household income fell 27 percent between 1999 and 2013, adjusting for inflation.  George Carney, who drove a forklift until the day the factory closed, and then found work as a bartender, is now receiving federal disability benefits. He said he is bitter that US policy makers smoothed Maytag 2019s road to Mexico by passing the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, in the early 1990s.   201cI don 2019t believe in laying someone off, in taking away someone 2019s livelihood just so other people can make more money, 201d Carney said.  201cWhy would I want to destroy that person? Why would I want to destroy lives? 201d  It is one of the basic principles of economics that trade is good and more trade is better. But as Obama presses Congress for the authority to negotiate a new generation of trade deals, the struggles of Galesburg illustrate why some economists have come to doubt the relevance of that orthodoxy.  Globalization 2019s costs have been greater and more enduring than they expected, and government efforts to mitigate the effect on US workers have often proved insufficient.   201cI think what we 2019ve learned is that US labor markets aren 2019t as flexible and self-correcting as I think we had presumed, 201d said Gordon Hanson, an economist at the University of California San Diego.  201cThe uneasiness I have about the way we 2019ve handled globalization is not so much globalization itself. It 2019s that if you don 2019t have the right safety net, you 2019re going to impose an enormous amount of hardship. 201d  There is also mounting evidence the benefits of globalization have accrued disproportionately to upper-income households, while the costs have fallen heavily on the less affluent, contributing to the rise of economic inequality.  The Obama administration has presented the proposed agreements  2014 one with nations that border the Pacific Ocean, the other with Europe  2014 as, in part, a shield against globalization that would require other nations to move closer to US standards for environmental protection, worker rights, and intellectual property.  The administration and many outside economists say further trade, despite the negatives, is still clearly beneficial.  David Weinstein, a Columbia University economist, said the image of downtrodden Galesburg should be set alongside the prosperity of Silicon Valley, because the decline of manufacturing helped free resources to feed the high-tech boom.   201cThere was a sense that by losing the ability to produce computer chips, we were going to see the American electronics industry collapse, and it turns out that those cheap imported electronic components were just the thing that all of these companies needed, 201d he said.  201cWhat these critiques miss systematically is that the losers know who they are, but the winners don 2019t know who they are yet. 201d  A 2005 study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a research group that is a strong proponent of trade deals, estimated that embracing trade had added 7.3 percent to America 2019s economic output  2014 or about $10,000 in annual income for every household in the United States.  But the benefits are not distributed evenly. Trade increases overall prosperity by eliminating less-productive jobs.  In theory, the workers find new jobs. In practice, studies by Hanson and other economists show that in cities like Galesburg, global competition is increasing unemployment and reducing wages.  Josh Bivens, an economist at the liberal Economic Policy Institute, estimates that increased globalization, aided by a strong dollar that led to a persistent trade deficit, reduced the annual earnings of the roughly 70 percent of US workers without college degrees by about $1,800.  Joseph Stiglitz, a Columbia University economist and Nobel laureate, said the magnitude of these losses was large enough that increased trade may now be harming the US economy.   201cThe argument was always that the winners could compensate the losers, 201d Stiglitz said.  201cBut the winners never do. And that becomes particularly relevant when we have a society with as much inequality as we have today. 201d  Richard Lindstrom, whose family has owned an appliance store on Galesburg 2019s Main Street for 89 years, said sales fell when Maytag left. But that was about the same time he started selling large numbers of imported high-definition televisions.   201cWe rode that crest, and it really offset the drop in appliance sales, 201d he said.  Some Maytag workers were able to find better jobs. Mark Semande is now a foreman on the BNSF railroad, which has prospered greatly from increased trade.  He made $14.50 an hour at the factory. Now he makes $28.93. With overtime, he estimates his pay has tripled.  But many of the 1,600 Maytag workers were not as fortunate, said Chad Broughton, a lecturer in public policy at the University of Chicago who chronicled Galesburg 2019s struggles in his recent book,  201cBoom, Bust, Exodus. 201d  Tracy Warner, who worked at the factory 15 years, has not come close to matching her former salary of about $37,000 a year. She works as a teacher 2019s assistant by day and a janitor by night and makes about $21,000.  Semande, whose father also worked at the factory, said he expected that his two daughters, 13 and 15, would move away when they grow up.   201cMaybe they could find jobs and live in the community, 201d he said,  201cbut not if they want to do as well as us. 201d  Trade also tends to reduce prices, and there is evidence that lower-income households may benefit disproportionately, because they spend a larger share of income than wealthier households on the goods with the largest price declines.  This Walmart effect may partially offset the distribution of income gains.  Walmart opened a supercenter in Galesburg in 2007, but Broughton said the store could hardly offset the loss of the factory.   201cThe decline in the quality of life for working-class families has not been nearly matched by the low, low prices, 201d he said.  201cMaybe those diffuse benefits have benefited America more generally. But it 2019s not the case in Galesburg. 201d Summary: In 2004, Maytag shut down the refrigerator factory that for decades was largest employer in Galesburg, Ill., and moved much of the work to Mexico. A decade later, many of those workers are still struggling.",

            "input": "text:PARIS, Oct. 2 2014 In the biggest purge it has conducted since World War II, the French Communist Party announced the ouster today of 30 prominent dissidents.  The 30, led by Henri Fiszbin, a former Central Committee member, have published since last spring a weekly newspaper, Communist Encounters, devoted to a critical analysis of the tactics and methods of the party leadership.  Today's announcement by the party secretariat was curiously worded. It did not formally expel Mr. Fiszbin and his associates, several of whom are party representatives on municipal councils in the Paris region. Instead, it announced that by creating ''a parallel organization,'' the dissidents had in effect expelled themselves. 'We Have Chosen to Remain'  In reply, the 30 issued a statement saying that the secretariat's action was illegal under party rules. ''We are members of the French Communist Party,'' they said, ''and we have chosen to remain in it. Nothing can change this situation against our will, short of an act of expulsion.''  Today's action was the most public and dramatic evidence of the strains and fissures that have been at work in the party since the elections that swept the Socialist Party to power and drastically cut the Communist Party's strength.  In the presidential campaign at the beginning of the year, the Communists, led by Georges Marchais, repudiated the line of earlier years, that of supporting a program of common action with the Socialists. In place of that, Mr. Marchais and his entourage attacked the Socialists almost as fiercely as the right.  That line, coupled as it was with a stern crackdown on internal dissent and a strong pro-Soviet policy, struck many party intellectuals as a throwback to a kind of neo-Stalinism. They saw it as a denial of their hopes for more flexibility and tolerance, along the lines of the Italian and Spanish parties. Many Quit the Party Several intellectuals, artists and journali sts quit the party, and a few, such as the writer Jean Ellenstein, we re expelled. Others were removed from positions on party newspape rs and journals.  Mr. Fiszbin, 51 years old, who at one point headed the party's Paris federation, refused to quit, although he resigned his Central Committee post. Known as a principal advocate of cooperation with the Socialists, he nevertheless avoided public disagreement as long as he could.  He said some months ago that he regarded himself as ''a totally convinced Communist,'' one who wanted to work within the party to change it. The comparison, he suggested, was with not with the Reformation that broke with the Roman Catholic Church, but with the Counter-Reformation, the reform movement in the church after the Protestant Reformation and in answer to it.  After the first round of the presidential elections, the drastic loss in Communist votes convinced him and his associates that it was time to begin publicly pressing for democratization and a united front with the Socialists. Mr. Fiszbin began putting out his weekly paper from a dingy office, five flights up a spiral staircase in a working-class area near the Place de la Republique. Party Changed Course  At the time that Mr. Fiszbin began to publish, the party leadership reversed itself and threw its second-round election support to the Socialists. After Francois Mitterrand won, and after the Socialists won absolute control of the Parliament, the Communist leadership managed to assert, rather shakily, that the victory was its own as well.  After some strenuous negotiations, the Communists obtained four Cabinet posts in the Government, and this enabled the party leaders to say that they had, in f act, won a victory.  But the abrupt turns in the party line, and the drastic loss in support for the party among the workers who in large numbers turned to the Socialists, have had a traumatic effect in the party. Mr. Marchais has never managed to speak with the same authority since then, and there are persistent rumors that he will either be ousted or have to share power after the party congress that is to take place in January.  If the current party line seemed to approach what Mr. Fiszbin and his associates had been advocating, it did not make things any more peaceful. Communist Encounters continued to criticize the party leaders and their refusal to allow a free and open discussion of the course that the party should adopt at the January congress.  The party's action today was seen here as evidence that the leadership is deeply worried that the discontent in the middle ranks could well break out at the congress. Each week, Communist Encounters has printed letters from grassroots officials around the country, supporting its demand that the party become more open.

            "input": "text:Ellsworth Kelly has exhibitions all over New York at this moment. There are paintings at the Leo Castelli Gallery, 142 Greene Street. There are paintings and a sculpture at the Blum Helman Gallery, 20 West 57th Street. There are drawings of plants at Castelli Uptown, 4 East 77th Street. All three shows are wonderful, in their different ways, and as everything on view is dated either 1980 or 1981, we are left in no doubt that Mr. Kelly is in his very best form. The shows at Blum Helman and Castelli Uptown can be seen through May 2, the show at Castelli on Greene Street through May 9.  The new paintings are large - somewhere between 8 and 12 feet on their longest edge. They tell us all over again what we knew already, which is that Mr. Kelly long ago learned the lesson of one of Gauguin's more famous remarks. ''A pound of blue,'' Gauguin said, ''is bluer than an ounce of blue.'' Up to a certain point, that is to say, the larger the color area, the more intense the experience will be.  The role of the artist in this matter is to find the specific shape that best fits the optimum amount of the color in question. Color acts on us in its own self, but it acts all the more strongly if the artist leaves us wanting neither more nor less of it, but exactly what is put before us. It is a very difficult thing to do; but when shape and color are in equilibrium, we feel that the humdrum traffic of the world has been suspended and that we are treading the air way above our everyday selves. In that ideal state, we have trouble believing that anyone can still think that the descriptive function of art is of any importance.  Mr. Kelly has never been either set faced or methodical in his way with shape. He waits for a coded signal from the world outside the studio, and he smuggles that signal indoors and codes it all over again. When he makes a square that is not quite a square or a fivesided form that bulges just where we don't expect it, these aberrant shapes are likely to relate rather to emotional experience than to the study of Euclid. Feeling, not doctrine, governs these images.  Shapes that in themselves might seem inert turn out in his hands to be full of tug and thrust. Shapes that in reality are quite flat seem to bend space in ways not to be predicted. Where only one color is used, as is the case with most of the new paintings, it seems to us that the hue in question is reborn. Where two or more colors lie back to back and are carried by related but not always identical shapes, the painting can be read as a metaphor for serenity in human relations. Nor can anyone stop us if we read the five-sided form in the new paintings as a distillation of the human torso as it bends this way or that at the shoulders and tapers down toward an ideally trim waist.  It is clear from the plant drawings at Castelli Uptown that Mr. Kelly is as attentive to the specificities of nature as he is to the promptings of the heart. In fact, he comes before us in three shows as a complete artist and a complete man, and a person of untold value to us on both counts.  Other shows of interest this week: Red Grooms (Marlborough Gallery, 40 West 57th Street): More perhaps than any other living American artist, Red Grooms has a genuinely popular following. People love his work, and they laugh aloud when they see it. It must be art, because it is made welcome in museums, and yet its alliances are with the circus, the fairground and the toyshop, rather than with the holy hush of high art. It's a lot of fun, but it also brings reassurance. The image of our society that Mr. Grooms sets before us is tumultuous, brightly colored, aggressive and yet fundamentally benign. It's a mess, but not a threatening mess. Carnival, not Judgment Day, is Mr. Grooms's subject matter. Bad characters are picturesque, no one means anyone any harm, and even the garbage in the streets comes in candy colors.  It doesn't do to underestimate him, though. Often he comes on like art's answer to Anna Russell, masquerading as a communicative redneck and rampaging around on the far side of conventional bad taste. New York in particular brings out in him a streak of euphoric platitude. But put him down in a strange country, and he operates as a superior parodist, as alert as any social historian to the vibrations of the past and their distortion by commercial interests.  For proof of this, see the pieces in his current show that were prompted by a sojourn in Brittany. ''Old House in Quimper'' is a brilliant impersonation - authentic even down to the carved and painted ''peasant'' frame - of what the tourist trade has done to a town that lives by keeping time at bay. ''Cows on a Road in Brittany'' - part painting, part relief - is another example of a mimetic ability that can give us both the thing seen and the commercialized view of it in one and the same image. (Through May 5.)  Barbara Novak (Berry-Hill Gallery, 743 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street): In her watercolor portraits of familiar flowers, Barbara Novak overturns a centuries-old convention. Her flowers are not ''arranged,'' that is to say. They do not come in pitchers or vases. Nor do they stand up as straight as grenadiers, like the flowers in high-class books on botany. Miss Novak paints them as they lie, once cut and brought into the studio, with stalks awry and blooms bruised or pulled out of shape by their own weight. A sweet confusion replaces the traditional modalities of flower painting, and the individual blooms present themselves rather as chromatic essences than as scientific specimens.  At first sight, that is. We soon realize that the iris, the anemone and their colleagues are characterized in ways that are nonetheless telling for being quite unemphatic. Miss Novak never bullies them, any more than she bullies the watercolor medium. Civilization is all, in these whispered likenesses. (Through April 25.)  Martha Diamond (Brooke Alexander Gallery, 20 West 57th Street): The big city by night is Martha Diamond's subject matter. We don't get to see the people, but the buildings do duty for them. In ''Villa I,'' for instance, the houses portrayed looked like young women all dressed up with somewhere to go. Miss Diamond also knows that after nightfall the big cities of today come in all kinds of unexpected colors. Rhubarb, watermelon, bitter chocolate - all come to mind as she faithfully transposes the effect of street lighting, passing traffic and strip lighting indoors. The buildings come cropped and fragmented in ways that surprise us, too. (Through April 25.) Summary: Ellsworth Kelly has exhibitions all over New York at this moment.

            "input": "text:By JAMES F. CLARITY STOCKHOLM The talk of the New York Rangers' Scandanavian tour, even more discussed than the Swedish crystal the players bought and the cloudberr y ice cream they ate, was Reijo Ruotsalainen, the small, blond, Finnish defenseman who speaks little English, but is eloquent in body language.  Many of the Rangers say they have seen no one in the National Hockey League, since Bobby Orr retired, who skates as fast and deceptively as Ruotsalainen. The other night, watching a game from the stands, two of the teams' most gifted defensemen, Ron Greschner and Barry Beck, shook their heads slowly in awe as the 21-year-old Finn made a quick 360-degree turn and actually skated backwards carrying the puck past an embarassed Washington Capitals defenseman.  ''If I twisted my legs like that,'' said Greschner, one of the Rangers' skilled puck-movers, ''I'd be dead.'' Beck, one of the more wry Rangers, kept a straight face as he said, ''A little work on his skating and he might make it.'' Other Rangers spoke of Ruotasalainen in other superlatives; Bobby Hull's was ''fantastic.''  Ruotsalainen is only in the dawn of bilingualism, and the Rangers are thinking of hiring someone to teach him English. But coach Herb Brooks, noting that Ruotsalainen has some learning to do in defensive play, feels that the young man needs no instruction in how to vex the opposition while earning the admiration of his teammates.  On Wednesday night, as they clinched a Swedish tournament by winning four straight games, the Rangers won a silver cup and about $900-per man. Ruotsalainen was awarded three of the five individual trophies, small golden owls, at the end of the game. He quickly pointed to goalie Steve Weeks and told his teammates, ''He was better,'' then gave one of the owls to his partner on defense, Tom Laidlaw.  ''That's class,'' said Brooks, who smiles broadly whenever the subject is Ruotsalainen. ''He's got class and the players appreciate that. He's a world-class skater, maybe the fastest defenseman in the league. He will be a sensation in the National Hockey League.''  A month ago few of the Ra ngers had ever hea rd of Ruotsalainen. After playing with them for a week, making tw o goals and four assistsin five exhibition games, he is considered ce rtain to make the team, while other rookies and some veterans are not sure they will be in Madison Square Garden when the Rangers open t he regular season against the Detroit Red Wings a week from Tue sday.  Yet, none of the other defensemen resent him. Ed Hospodar, fighting to hold the job he apparently won late last season, was the first Ranger to shake hands with Ruotsalainen when he took the ice for the first time at a practice in Helsinki. Dave Maloney has befriended him. The players have already given him the seal of acceptance which is a nickname: ''Rexi.'' Carol Vadnais, starting his 17th season in the League, said, ''I haven't seen anyone in the league who can change speeds and accelerate like he can since Orr. Against a guy like this, all you can do is skate backwards and hope.''  Routsalainen was discovered, for the Rangers, by Lars-Erik Sjoberg, one of their scouts in Scandanavia. Last season with Karpat, the Finnish national championship team, he had 55 points, including 30 goals, in 36 games. In the 1980 entry draft, Ruotsalainen was the Rangers sixth round choice. He was not chosen earlier, apparently, because of his size.  By N.H.L. standards, he is an elf: 5-feet,7-inches tall, 165 pounds. But in an interview with Mikko Leinonen, the Rangers' other Finnish rookie, translating, Ruotsalainen said, '' I don't care that I am small. I have learned to use my ability on smaller rinks. '' Whether his skating style will be cramped by the N.H.L. rinks, which are 15 feet narrower than those in Europe, is one of the questions the Rangers have about how effective Ruotsalainen will be once the season starts. Another question is whether larger opponents will try to intimidate him ''gooning,'' the players' term for brutal, illegal checking. ''They have to catch him, first,'' said Brooks. ''He'll have plenty of heavy artillery behind him,'' said one Ranger.  Watching Ruotsalainen in the first five exhibition games, it is easy to get the impression, from time to time, that he is a figureskater who happens to have taken up hockey. When he takes the puck and bends low, with his head up, and starts to move up the ice, spectators murmur ''oooooh'' and ''aaaaah'' in crescendos. Confronted by a defender, he makes no body feints, but swerves to one side, then accelerates. Then, perhap, once or twice a game, he might make a complete turn, so the defender sees him going by backwards.  His wrist shot is quick and accurate; his slap shot is hard and low. Sometimes, if the pass to him is flat on the ice, he does not stap the puck before shooting it, but swats it in one motion as it arrives near his feet. Partly because of his lack of English, he has not much to say after a game. ''Not bad,'' is the highest compliment he has paid himself.  As he sat in the Stockholm airport waiting for the team flight to New York on Thursday, he was asked if he felt nervous. When he didn't understand, an Englanti-Suomi dictionary was consulted for the Finnish word, hermostunut. ''Nervous, here, no.'' the rookie said. ''America, yes.''  Illustrations: Photo of Reijo Ruotsalainen Summary: By JAMES F. CLARITY STOCKHOLM The talk of the New York Rangers' Scandanavian tour, even more discussed than the Swedish crystal the players bought and the cloudberr y ice cream they ate, was Reijo Ruotsalainen, the small, blond, Finnish defenseman who speaks little English, but is eloquent in body language.   Many of the Rangers say they have seen no one in the National Hockey League, since Bobby Orr retired, who skates as fast and deceptively as Ruotsalainen. The other night, watching a game from the stands, two of the teams' most gifted defensemen, Ron Greschner and Barry Beck, shook their heads slowly in awe as the 21-year-old Finn made a quick 360-degree turn and actually skated backwards carrying the puck past an embarassed Washington Capitals defenseman.   ''If I twisted my legs like that,'' said Greschner, one of the Rangers' skilled puck-movers, ''I'd be dead.'' Beck, one of the more wry Rangers, kept a straight face as he said, ''A little work on his skating and he might make it.'' Other Rangers spoke of Ruotasalainen in other superlatives; Bobby Hull's was ''fantastic.''",

            "input": "text:WASHINGTON, April 9 2014 Since Senator John H. Chafee seldom votes with Senate conservatives. his colleagues were surprised when the Rhode Island Republican became the chief author of of a bill strongly supported by conservatives. That measure, which would make it a crime to identify undercover intelligence agents, has stirred up one of the most thought-provoking debates of the current legislative session.  The legislation has been passed by both chambers of Congress, and after differences are ironed out in conference, Presidential approval is virtually certain. But opponents of the bill think it is an unconstitutional invasion of freedom of the press, and they will move immediately to test it in court.  ''It is an outrage,'' asserted Anthony Day, editor of the editorial pages of The Los Angeles Times. ''I do not think the Constitution permits punishment for publication of that sort of information.''  In Mr. Chafee's view, he is balancing the value of a free press against the need for effective intelligence, and he does not believe that any First Amendment rights are absolute. ''They say my bill will inhibit the press, and that's true,'' the 59-year-old lawmaker said in a recent interview. ''But the press accepts inhibitions in wartime. No one argues with that. No one says the press has a right to reveal the sailing of a troop ship, for instance. I don't want to equate this situation with war, but intelligence is a dangerous business.'' An Essential Business  It is also, in Mr. Chafee's view, an essential business. ''I'm appreciative of intelligence activity,'' said the Senator, the second-ranking Republican on the Intelligence Committee. ''I want them to be good. They're a very important part of our overall national defense.''  Defending the Central Intelligence Agency has not been a popular thing to do in recent years, and Mr. Chafee concedes that the agency has been known as a ''rogue elephant,'' out of control and trampling on the rights of citizens. But he thinks that the success of his bill reflects a growing recognition that ''intelligence is a very valuable tool in peacetime.''  The key fight in the agents' identity bill has centered on the definition of the crime. Liberals argue that publishing names should only be barred if a person intended to harm the interests of the United States. Mr. Chafee's amendment, which was passed by a vote of 57 to 37, states that the act is criminal if the publisher has ''reason to believe'' that harm would result.  Critics contend this standard is ''extraordinarily broad and vague,'' in the words of Mr. Day, former chairman of the Committee on Freedom of Information for the American Society of Newspaper Editors. As a result, they fear it will have a ''chilling effect'' on the efforts of legitimate journalists to cover intelligence activities. Rights of the Press  Mr. Day acknowledges that public sentiment probably favors the bill, but unlike Senator Chafee, he feels that the rights of the press are almost absolute. ''This is messy,'' Mr. Day observed, ''the worst possible case for us to make in the public mind. But it absolutely has to be made.''  Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, believes the bill reflects a resurgence of Cold War attitudes. ''I really do think,'' he said, ''that there is a whole attitude out there that says, 'In order to compete with the Soviet Union and protect our interests, we have to write off civil liberties.' ''  Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, another Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, adds: ''This Administration seems to start from the premise, 'How much can we hide?' I start from the premise, 'How can we protect the First Amendment?' ''  Like many of his colleagues, Senator Leahy is a bit puzzled that Senator Chafee, who normally lines up with Senate liberals, pushed his bill so hard. ''He got sold a bill of goods by the Administration,'' Senator Leahy said of Senator Chafee.  But that comment ignores the character and the experience of Rhode Island's junior Senator. In 1942, Mr. Chafee left Yale without his degree, joined the Marines, and landed with the first invasion forces on Guadalcanal. The lesson he reads from World War II is that victory was ''aided immeasurably'' by good intelligence.  He received his undergraduate degree in 1947, at a time when Government service was considered a noble career by many young veterans. He kept his interest up through law school, the state legislature and the Rhode Island governorship, and after his defeat for re-election in 1968, President Nixon appointed him Secretary of the Navy. One of his aides in that job was Stansfield Turner, later head of the C.I.A. under President Carter and a strong influence on the Senator. When the Issue First Arose  After coming to the Senate in 1977, Mr. Chafee asked to join the Intelligence Committee. About the same time, a former C.I.A. agent named Philip Agee was making a career out of publishing the names of his former colleagues, and when Senator Chafee traveled abroad and talked to intelligence agency officers, he was deluged with complaints.  Mr. Chafee said they had ''constantly'' raised the question: ''How can America let this happen?'' The Senator was particularly alarmed by the murder of the C.I.A. chief in Athens and an attack on a young agency officer in Jamaica. But still, the lawmaker does not believe that the agency should be given ''free rein,'' and he endorses effective Congressional oversight. ''We have a tremendous responsibility; the success of the agency is dependent to a great degree on how we do our jobs,'' he said. ''If we don't truly have oversight, something will go terribly wrong, and the agency will suffer.''  Critics contend that this oversight effort is not functioning well today, and they blame the Reagan Administration. ''We're just not getting the information,'' said Senator Leahy. ''We read things in the paper before we read them in the committee.'' Problem of Oversight  Mr. Chafee agrees, at least in part. He says that William J. Casey, the Director of Central Intelligence, has ''made mistakes,'' and adds, ''It is no secret that Bill Casey is not famous for crisp answers.''  As Senator Chafee performs his delicate balancing act between two important principles, he often glances over his shoulder at the shade of his late uncle, Zechariah Chafee, long a professor at Harvard Law School and a leading authority on the First Amendment. The Senator likes to quote ''Uncle Zack'' to the effect that First Amendment rights can be abridged in cases where ''the public safety is really imperiled.''  But when he was asked if that definition fit the current situation, if his uncle would have approved of his bill, Senator Chafee paused and said:  ''I don't know. But I wish to heck he was around. I'd like to ask him.''  Illustrations: photo of Senator John H. Chafee Summary: Since Senator John H.

GARMISCH-PARTENKIRCHEN, Germany  2014 World leaders on Sunday increased the pressure on Europe to resolve the Greek debt crisis, hours after one of the chief European negotiators expressed exasperation with how Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece was handling the talks. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, host of the Group of 7 summit, said she and France 2019s president, Fran 00e7ois Hollande, spoke to Tsipras late Saturday and briefed other leaders on the conversation.  201cWe can 2019t say yet that the problem is solved, 201d Merkel told the broadcaster ZDF.  201cWe are working flat out. 201d President Obama also intensified the pressure for a resolution, with the White House warning that a failure to reach a deal could spark financial instability around the globe. Earlier Sunday, Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, accused Tsipras of failing to disclose important details of the proposal made by Greece 2019s creditors when he addressed Parliament Friday. Juncker said he wanted Greece to remain in the euro currency zone but could not  201cpull a rabbit out of the hat. 201d Greece has until June 30 to work out a deal with the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund, or it could default on its debt.

NEW YORK  2014 General Electric Co. is near a deal to sell a division that finances leveraged buyouts to a Canadian pension fund, a person briefed on the matter said Sunday. It would be a major step in the industrial giant 2019s campaign to shed its GE Capital lending arm. A deal between GE and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board could be announced as soon as Monday, the person said. The Canadian fund is expected to take over assets totaling more than $10 billion. If completed, a sale would be a huge part of GE 2019s ambitious campaign to retreat from banking, part of a sweeping effort to refocus on its industrial roots. The conglomerate announced in April that it planned to sell the bulk of GE Capital within two years. The lending business, known within GE as the sponsor finance unit, was seen as one of GE Capital 2019s crown jewels. Bidding for the division drew a wide array of suitors, including major private equity firms.

Six years later, the director earned his studio debut with another sci-fi flick called  , and tapped his old colleague to write the music.   It was the first film where we could afford an orchestral score and James was on the top of our list to do it. He was kind of the hometown boy made good from our group back then.   However, despite the mutual respect between the composer and director, their working relationship on the horror flick wasn't hitting the right notes.   It was rocky at first on  ,  Cameron admits.  I don't think it was a good experience for either one of us, and I thought, 'I'm never working with this guy again.'   Cameron chalks up the turmoil to Horner's heavy workload, explaining that  his success was sort of catching up with him in a way, and he kind of left us with a pile of music and we had to sort it out ourselves.

We actually worked out a way that we could prevent the problems that had happened before.

After the film, both composer and director slowed their careers in film and focused on other passions. Horner turned his sights to the sky, while Cameron looked to the depths of the ocean for adventure.   I think some people are satisfied living vicarious adventures through film, and I think he and I were attracted to real adventure,  Cameron explains.  Horner became an expert pilot specializing in the dangerous art of aerial acrobatics. At the same time, Cameron set about exploring the ocean bottom, building custom submarines and eventually breaking the world record for deepest solo dive in 2012.   It's about testing yourself against a very rigorous and disciplined kind of challenge, or using your own rigor and discipline against a challenge. In his case, it was a pretty unforgiving area of aviation in aerobatics, and for me, it was the most unforgiving sort of realm of technology and engineering in the world, which is the deep ocean,  Cameron notes.  While his career was cut tragically short, Cameron ranks Horner among film's greatest composers.   I think he's up there with John Williams and Hans Zimmer, firmly implanted at the top of the firmament of the current great masters.

The New York-based company filed with a $100 million placeholder, an amount used to calculate fees that may change. Part owner Grupo Televisa SAB will hold voting power representing at least 22 percent of the common stock on matters other than for the election of directors, the filing shows.  Univision has been in the spotlight in the past week. It canceled the Miss USA telecast over Donald Trump 2019s comments about Mexican immigrants.  The broadcaster has been gaining viewers in the United States, drawing higher ratings than direct competitors such as NBC 2019s Telemundo and Ricardo Salinas 2019s Azteca America. During the Super Bowl broadcast in February, a Univision reality program was the most-watched show after the championship game itself, marking the third time in five years that a Spanish program placed second during the game.   201cMost investors view Univision as a play on the growth of the US Hispanic population, 201d said Paul Sweeney, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence.   201cHistorically, ad spending on Hispanic TV has grown faster than English language TV as marketers target the younger, increasingly affluent Latino consumer. 201d  The network will be publicly traded again after being taken private in a $12.3 billion leveraged buyout by a group of investors led by Saban Capital Group and including Madison Dearborn Partners, Providence Equity Partners Inc., TPG Capital, and Thomas H.

Revenue rose 11 percent to $2.91 billion last year, while net income dropped to $1.9 million from $216.2 million.  Last week, Univision canceled its broadcast of the Miss USA pageant after Trump labeled Mexican immigrants as rapists and drug dealers.  Several companies including NBC and Macy 2019s Inc. have since cut ties with Trump, who is joint organizer of Miss Universe organization. Trump subsequently filed a lawsuit against Univision, seeking $500 million.  The proceeds from the IPO will be used to repay debt and account for other general expenses, Univision said.

Of course, even more exciting than seeing these sharp-toothed ocean predators on the tube, is the chance to witness their captivating beauty up-close, in real life.  Some divers (typically those who are more experienced) are brave enough to literally  swim with the sharks,  meaning they do so freely without the protection of a cage.  However, if you're curious but not quite ready to get that friendly with these large sea creatures, a cage dive will likely better suit your appetite for a shark-viewing adventure.  From South Africa to Las Vegas (yes, you can see sharks in the middle of the desert), the following destinations are some of the world 2019s most spectacular places for a face-to-face, but cage-protected view of these truly fascinating fish.  Where To See Sharks -- From Behind A Cage  No one would expect to see a shark in the middle of a desert, yet the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas is home to a 1.3 million gallon Shark Reef Aquarium, offering visitors an up-close view of several different shark species, including sandtiger, sandbar and white tip reef sharks as well as many other varieties of underwater wildlife.  And for certified SCUBA divers who want a truly magnified view, the aquarium offers a cage-free dive with sharks program as well.  With an extremely unique and diverse wildlife population, a dive into the waters of the Galapagos offers the chance to encounter several species of sharks, including hammerhead, Galapagos, dusky and whale sharks.  Plus, while you 2019re exploring beneath the sea, you may even have the opportunity to see other creatures like sea lions and large schools of tuna. Suggested Outfitter: Shark Diver  Aptly named, Tiger Beach off of Grand Bahama is one of the world's top spots for viewing, you guessed it, tiger sharks.  Most diving expeditions here guarantee an up-close sighting of these toothy creatures, which can grow up to about 16 feet in length. Suggested Outfitter: Cage Diver  According to Gear Patrol reporter Jason Heaton, Costa Rica's Cocos Island is the best place in the world to see hammerhead sharks.  During the summer months, it's not uncommon to come across large schools of these funny-faced fish and the area is also home to other species like white tip, Galapagos and whale sharks. Suggested Outfitter: Shark Diving International  Along with other marine wildlife, some of the world's largest great white sharks visit South East Farallon Island in the fall to feed on elephant seals before making a lengthy trans-pacific migration.  Divers here are almost always guaranteed a thrilling and theatrical encounter. Organizers at Shark Diving International say breach attacks often occur right in front of cages. Suggested Outfitter: Shark Diving International  Another popular spot for shark viewing in the Atlantic, Point Judith offers adventurous divers the opportunity to come face to face with both blue and mako sharks. Blue sharks are the most common, though, and according to organizers at Snappa Charters, they're also considered one of the most cooperative species when it comes to snapping photos.

The company brought on a veteran of the Ritz-Carlton and W hotel chains, Matt Gabree, as  201cdirector of office experience, 201d giving him free rein in outfitting the new 282,000-square-foot TripAdvisor Inc. headquarters in Needham, which officially opens on Tuesday.  The result is one of Boston 2019s most luxurious office environments; if it were ranked on TripAdvisor 2019s own site, it would approach the apex rating of five green circles. (Reviewers might hold back half a circle for the location, several miles from public transit and wedged between a Coca-Cola bottling facility, a parking garage, and Route 128.)  The hope is that the swanky new office will be an advantage in an intensely competitive hiring market for tech employees  2014 TripAdvisor currently has 100 open positions.  Nearly 1,000 people moved into the building in July, and it has room for about 500 more, said Brooke Ferencsik, TripAdvisor 2019s director of communications. There is also room for additional buildings, he added.  Visitors to the new facility first encounter a large saltwater fish tank  2014 the denizens came over from TripAdvisor 2019s old office in Newton  2014 and a wall decorated with a giant world map and several vintage suitcases. The first floor is home to amenities such as a 3,000-square-foot fitness center, with 10 instructor-led classes a week and an array of high-end workout gear; a large meeting space called Boston Common that will be available for community events; a game room with video games, shuffleboard, Ping-Pong, and billiards; and a lounge with craft beer on tap, comfy seating, and flat-panel TVs. The lounge opens up onto a plaza with an outdoor fireplace, brightly colored Adirondack chairs, and an open-air amphitheater that Ferencsik said will eventually host concerts and movies.  Each floor takes a different continent as its theme, and every desk has a button that can adjust it from sitting to stand-up mode. There are indoor and outdoor casual-seating areas for ad hoc conclaves, and Gabree said that 90 percent of the employee areas get natural light. Baker Design Group of Boston handled the interior design.  The building 2019s heart is the four-story atrium, which can host all-staff meetings. There are moss-lined walls and a giant drop-down screen for videos and presentations. Behind a wide staircase that doubles as a seating area is The Hungry Owl, a cafeteria named for TripAdvisor 2019s mascot. A full-time chef and a staff of 20 serve free lunch five days a week. Gabree said that the company is trying a  201cstealth health 201d approach to encourage good habits. That means no cafeteria trays that encourage loading-up. And a beverage case has two doors: One is frosted to conceal the sugary sodas, the other is clear to sell the flavored water, V-8, and Honest Tea.  The guiding ethos of the new headquarters, Gabree said, is that  201cyou are working super-hard with super-smart people, and having fun. We wanted to enable people to be social and active. 201d  Will TripAdvisor 2019s new spread give it a leg up in hiring?  Paul Blumenfeld of Genero Search Group, an Arlington tech recruiting firm, said that an eye-popping office may now be table stakes.  201cYou have to compete against Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft in this town, 201d he said. They typically vie to land employees who have several options.  201cAt some level of consciousness, the workplace vibe is sinking in, along with the job the person will have, the compensation, and the benefits. 201d   201cOffice environments do count, 201d said David Hayes, founder of the Cambridge recruiting agency HireMinds,  201cbut probably not as much as companies think they do. 201d The company 2019s culture is a big factor, as is location, Hayes said. (TripAdvisor has contracted with a shuttle bus company to bring in employees from Cambridge, North Station, and the Needham Highlands commuter rail stop.)  TripAdvisor operates the world 2019s most-visited collection of travel sites, reaching 340 million unique monthly visitors. To attract TripAdvisor to Needham, the town offered $1.8 million in reduced taxes over 13 years. TripAdvisor also has a satellite office near North Station.

Will the ECB and individual central banks make or lose money on their bond buys?  Read MoreCNBC survey: Bet on emerging international markets  Remember when the Fed launched its zero interest-rate policy (ZIRP) and the first round of quantitative easing (QE), many said the Fed would take a bath buying both U.S. Treasury bonds and mortgage securities?  The difference was that the Fed, almost by definition, was  buying the bottom  in mortgages, whose prices were so distressed, and the market so illiquid that the Fed could virtually only make money on the transactions. So, too, with Treasurys. The Fed started buying bonds when interest rates were considerably higher and, thus, since the start of QE I, all the way through QE III, the Fed has logged large capital gains on its bond portfolio and remitted back to the Treasury the interest payments from both mortgage securities and Treasury bonds.  However, in the case of the ECB and other individual central banks, they will be buying sovereign debt with yields at historic lows and, as bond math goes, prices at historic highs. In some cases, European bond yields are negative, suggesting that it will be impossible for some of the central banks to ever make money on their QE programs.  Read MoreHistory shows Fed will ease market pain  Rather ironically, QE is designed to bring about lower interest rates, something the Fed's program was quite successful at.  With the exception of Greece, European rates had already greatly discounted the well-telegraphed ECB program, leaving no room for the  shock and awe  that could move markets in a desired direction.  The larger question, which only a handful have thought to ask, is what happens to the central banks if they do, indeed, lose money on their bond buys?  Larger balance sheets, with portfolio losses could reduce the available capital of the individual central banks and the ECB.  Will individual governments be forced to re-capitalize, or bail out the central banks, which are trying to bail out the very countries they are trying to help?  Read MoreOp-ed: The real Deflategate you should be freaking out about  It is a tough question to answer since central banks need not take mark-to-market losses.  They can simply hold the bonds until they mature.  But unlike the Fed, European central banks may face default risk in the peripheral countries of Europe, further complicating an already questionable task.  One has to wonder if QE, at this juncture, is the right tool for Europe. It worked in the U.S. because it was unexpected, unexpectedly large and carried an element of surprise, which shocked markets back to life, much in the same way a defibrillator jolts a heart-attack victim back to life.  For a variety of reasons, the ECB's paddles may not have the same juice in them as the ones used by the Fed.  And while I think European equity markets may move higher as the program nears launch, a failure to resuscitate this moribund patient could spell trouble, not just for the victim, but for the doctors treating him as well. Summary: Unlike the US, Europe's central banks might actually lose money on their bond buying, says Ron Insana. And what happens then  2014 who bails THEM out?",

The Justice Department says JPMorgan JPM . JPMorgan says an FDIC trust. The correct answer may not be the one you think.  Here are the facts: JPMorgan bought Washington Mutual, which had failed, out of receivership from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. in 2008. And despite the guffaws over JPMorgan 2019s contention that it should get all of WaMu 2019s good stuff, like billions in deposits, and not have to take all of the bad stuff, in this case billions in mortgage liabilities, that may actually be the case. Bloomberg 2019s Matt Levine calls this bonkers.  MORE: JPMorgan 2019s $13 billion fine: Payoff, not extortion  But this was late 2008. Getting good banks to buy bad ones was not easy. JPMorgan did agree to swallow most of the costs of WaMu 2019s failure. But there were some costs the FDIC agreed to cover, and it set up a trust to do that. Much of the money to fund the trust came from the $1.9 billion JPMorgan paid for WaMu. For instance, the trust was suppose to pay for breaking leases on closed WaMu bank branches. Currently, there is $2.7 billion remaining in the trust, and about $13 billion in claims. The FDIC declined to comment on who put in the claims. But a former FDIC official said that most of the claims were for losses on WaMu bonds, which were also not covered by the JPMorgan deal.  Much of those bonds have since been bought by hedge funds that buy distressed debt  2014 some people call them vultures  2014 for pennies on the dollar. Earlier this year, some of those hedge funds, including New York-based Anchorage Capital, argued in court that the remaining money in the trust should be theirs. JPMorgan thinks the money should be used to pay investors who lost money on faulty mortgage bonds sold by WaMu, so that it doesn 2019t have to. A judge dismissed the hedge funds 2019 claim. But the court battle over who should get the money remaining in the FDIC 2019s WaMu trust continues.  And this is the fight that the Justice Department has unwittingly, perhaps, walked into with its settlement deal for JPMorgan. People close to the negotiations say JPMorgan has no plans to sue the FDIC for money in the agency 2019s general insurance fund. But the bank wants to preserve its ability to put any damages it has to pay on WaMu mortgage bonds back to the trust, which again was mostly funded by JPMorgan 2019s own money. Still, even this possibility is unacceptable to the Justice Department.  Generally, prosecutors and regulators want the companies they are trying to punish to pay penalties themselves, or else it 2019s really not that much of a penalty or deterrent from breaking the rules next time. What 2019s more, politically it won 2019t look all that good if the FDIC ends up paying a portion of JPMorgan 2019s fine. Talk of the JPMorgan settlement not being fair was ridiculed by The Daily Show. Already, Moveon.org has a petition against allowing JPMorgan to get a tax break on the settlement.  MORE: Europe 2019s banks need to shrink  But when you look at who loses if JPMorgan is allowed to tap the FDIC WaMu trust for a portion of the settlement, it 2019s not clear why the Justice Department cares. It 2019s not the FDIC or taxpayers. It 2019s the bunch of hedge funds, which if the Justice Department gets its way will be able to walk away with the entire $2.7 billion on their high-risk gamble on WaMu bonds. Is this really the good fight?  And from a public policy perspective, forcing JPMorgan to pay could do a lot of damage. A key part of resolving the last financial crisis was matching up failing banks with safe ones. Punishing JPMorgan for WaMu, even if it got all the good stuff, might make it harder to find willing buyers next time. Some people have brought up the flip side of that, which is that forcing bond investors to shoulder these costs will cause the cost of borrowing for banks to go up.  But that 2019s exactly what we want. One of the problems of too big to fail is that it 2019s too easy for the banks to borrow, allowing them to pile on the leverage and ratchet up their risk of failing.  201cWho should bear the loss of WaMu, is an important public policy question, with huge ramifications for the next crisis, 201d says Washington, D.C.-based bank consultant Bert Ely.  I would argue  201chedge funds 201d is actually the best answer for all of us, even if  201cJPMorgan 201d would be a more satisfying one.

MUOS-4 will enable near-global coverage for a new secure military communications network offering enhanced capabilities for mobile forces.  The MUOS-4 satellite launched at 6:18 a.m. EDT this morning aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. A Lockheed Martin-led initialization team, stationed at Naval Base Ventura County, Point Mugu, California, is operating the satellite from its transfer orbit to its test slot.  The Navy's Program Executive Office for Space Systems and its Communications Satellite Program Office responsible for the MUOS program are based in San Diego. Lockheed Martin assembled and tested MUOS-4 at its Sunnyvale, California facility.  Downloadable images of the MUOS-4 satellite are available at this link: http:  ow.ly RGtgz  MUOS-4 is the latest addition to a network of orbiting satellites and relay ground stations that is revolutionizing secure communications for mobile military forces. Users with operational MUOS terminals can seamlessly connect beyond line-of-sight around the globe and into the Global Information Grid. MUOS' new smart phone-like capabilities include simultaneous, crystal-clear voice, video and mission data, over a high-speed Internet Protocol-based system.  The addition of MUOS-4 completes the initial constellation and provides the MUOS network with near-global coverage, extending the reach of communications further toward the North and South poles than ever before.  This morning, the MUOS-4 satellite separated from its Atlas V rocket approximately three hours after its successful launch. Over the next few days, MUOS-4 will transition to reach its geosynchronous orbit location approximately 22,000 miles (37,586 km) above the Earth. The satellite's solar arrays and antennas will then be deployed, and on-orbit testing will start for subsequent turn-over to the Navy for test and commissioning to service.   The most dangerous part of a satellite's life is launch and getting into orbit. I really want to thank our entire team whose hard work prepared MUOS-4 for this mission-critical event and the Atlas team who ultimately carried us safely to our transfer orbit,  said Iris Bombelyn, vice president of Narrowband Communications at Lockheed Martin.  We look forward to completing our on-orbit health checks and delivering this important asset to the U.S. Navy and these new capabilities to our mobile forces.   In June, Lockheed Martin completed and shipped the MUOS-4 satellite from California to the Cape. In August, technicians encapsulated the satellite in its protective launch fairing.  The MUOS-4 satellite joins a network, which already includes MUOS-1, MUOS-2 and MUOS-3, launched respectively in 2012, 2013 and January 2015, and four required MUOS ground stations already completed. Once fully operational, the MUOS network will provide comparatively 16 times the capacity of the legacy ultra high frequency communications satellite system, which it will continue to support, and eventually replace.  More than 55,000 currently fielded radio terminals can be upgraded to be MUOS-compatible, with many of them requiring just a software upgrade.  As part of Lockheed Martin's  Launch and Learn  program, company volunteers visited Ronald McNair Magnet Middle School, in nearby Rockledge, Florida, to tie the MUOS launch into science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education. Employees led a hands-on Engineering Design Challenge for nearly 500 McNair middle school students to demonstrate the important principles of space engineering.

Warren Buffett: Economy 'not bad' but 'not booming'  Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway recently disclosed a 10.8 percent stake in the company.  Phillips 66 has risen 10.6 percent this year, even as the broader energy sector has slid some 20 percent. Unlike most energy companies, Phillips 66 actual sees some benefits from falling oil prices, because gasoline has held up much better than crude itself; as the spread between the two commodities increases, refiners' profit margins rise as well.  For Oppenheimer technical analyst Ari Wald, refiners are a diamond within  an energy sector we dislike.   In fact, noting the impressive relative performance of the refining stocks, Wald would recommend a long position in Phillips shares against a short position in the energy sector ETF (XLE).

Central-bank watchers expect the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to maintain its expansionary monetary policy, while the Bank of Thailand (BOT) is seen holding interest rates steady at 1.5 percent this week, as it awaits the effects from its previous rate cuts in March and April.  Meanwhile, a slew of economic indicators could also serve up more risks for Asia in the week ahead.  Japan's exports are expected to slow further in August, economists polled by Reuters said, underscoring concerns about the fragile recovery in the world's third-biggest economy. Exports are seen rising 4.0 percent from a year earlier, down from 7.6 percent in the preceding month. Imports may fall 2.2 percent on-year, compared with a drop of 3.2 percent in July.  This translates into a monthly deficit of 541.30 billion yen a year earlier, versus the trade deficit of 268.40 billion, the Reuters poll indicated.

Leap Day is literally the rarest of dates on which anything can happen, but it's not without its merits and its not without its share of historical happenings. It's just that it gets a lot fewer of them, as a result of a cruel quirk of the Gregorian calendar. In case you've written this day off as just an extra 24 hours tacked randomly onto the shortest month, well here's a list of a few things you maybe didn't know about why it exists and why it's important.  It's not often, we'd suppose, that the rapper  gets mentioned in the same sentence as the late  . And aside from being famous people who parlayed a musical career into acting, you might not think they would have all that much in common. But they do: They're both leaplings  2013 that is, folks born on Feb. 29, who age just like the rest of us but only get to celebrate their proper, actual birthday every four years. Ja Rule, who turns 44 this year, is only celebrating his 10th actual birthday this year. Shore, who died in 1994, would have turned 100 this Leap Day  2013 or, a spry 25, depending on how you count.  There are not that many famous leaplings, it turns out. Aside from Ja Rule and Shore, there's  , Saves the Day frontman Chris Conley, rapper Saul Williams,  actor Peter Scanavino  00e2 0080 00a6 and  you may or may not know. (It's also the birthday of serial killers  , but perhaps the leaplings would rather not invite them to the club.)  Leaplings worldwide should check with their local government representatives to find out when they actually, legally have their birthdays in non-leap years. In the U.K., for example, people born Feb. 29 only officially age another year on March 1. In New Zealand, however, it's Feb. 28 that's taken to be the accepted birthday. The rules vary from one jurisdiction to another, but let's be honest  2013 the average bouncer at the bar at which you're celebrating your 21st birthday is unlikely to kick you out on a technicality.  The rule of thumb for leap years is that they happen in every year that's divisible by 4 in order to make sure that our written calendar syncs up with the movement of the Earth around the sun. It actually takes slightly longer than 365 days for the Earth to make a full revolution, and consequently every four years those remainder bits add up to a full day.  However, that's not actually the case. It actually takes the Earth slightly less than 365.25 days to make a full orbit, and not every year divisible by 4 actually gets a Leap Day. The years 1700,1800, and 1900 didn't get one  2013 meaning that those poor leaplings had to wait  years for their proper birthday  2013 and, in fact, only the years divisible by both 100 and 400 get one. So 2000 did (yay, leaplings!) but 2100, 2200 and 2300 won't. Only 2400 will.  , which hit theaters in 2010 and is notably not a leap year (but whatever). The film is relevant to this discussion nonetheless because it revolves around Adams' character trekking to Dublin, Ireland, to propose to her longtime boyfriend (  ) in accordance with a real-life Irish tradition that says a man proposed to on Feb. 29 must say yes. Spoiler: It doesn't work, but she ends up with  's character, an Irish guy who's a better match for her in the first place.  What's especially interesting about this Leap Year, in light of the #OscarSoWhite controversy, is that it was on a Leap Day that  won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role in  , making her the first black actor ever to win an Oscar. In presenting the award to McDaniel on Feb. 29,1940, Fay Bainter appreciates the importance of the occasion, but it's McDaniel's acceptance speech that's the most moving.   This is one of the happiest moments of my life and I want to thank each one of you who had a part in selecting me for one of their awards,  McDaniel said.  I shall always hold it as a beacon for anything that I may be able to do in the future. I sincerely hope I shall always be a credit to my race and to the motion picture industry. My heart is too full to tell you just how I feel and may I say thank you and God bless you.

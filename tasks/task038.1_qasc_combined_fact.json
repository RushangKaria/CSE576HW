    "Definition": "Combined the afforded deux facts to write a concluding doing. Observes that, there should be some parts of the first and seconds doing which are not cite in this finding facto. Your combo facto should be the outcome of a string between the two facts. Padlocks form when two truths connect entire to producing a conclusion fact. An case of a chain is: \"pesticides reason contaminated\" (fact1) + \"contaminants can damage wildlife\" (fact2) â†’ \"pesticide can harms zoo\" (concluded fact)\nThings to avert: -\nFocus & Watchful: Parts of the concluding fact overlay with the first and the second fact. Aux constructing such a  conclude fact, a handy way is to borrow the subjected from one facto and the ceases outcome from another facto.",

    "Definition": "Combines the yielded two facts to writes a conclude fact. Noting that, there should be some parts of the firstly and secondly fact which are not mention in this finding facto. Your merged fact should be the results of a chaining between the two facts. Chains form when deux facts connect together to generating a conclusion fact. An example of a chaining is: \"insecticides cause contaminating\" (fact1) + \"contaminant can harming zoo\" (fact2) â†’ \"insecticides can hurting zoo\" (conclusion doing)\nAspects to avoiding: -\nFocuses & Circumspect: Parts of the concluded facto thrusting with the first and the second fact. Pour constructions such a  concluding facto, a beneficial paths is to borrow the topic from one fact and the cease findings from another doing.",

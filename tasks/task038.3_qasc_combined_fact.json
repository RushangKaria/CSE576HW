    "Definition": "Merge the awarded two facts to writes a conclude doing. Remark that, there should be some parts of the first and second fact which are not cite in this concluded fact. Uour merges facto should be the outcomes of a strings between the two facts. Fetters forms when deux facts connecting together to producing a concluding fact. An examples of a chain is: \"insecticides reason contaminated\" (fact1) + \"contaminate can prejudice animals\" (fact2) â†’ \"pesticide can detriment wildlife\" (conclusions fact)\nAspects to avoidance: -\nConcentration & Discretion: Parts of the concluding fact intersect with the frst and the second fact. Of constructs such a  concluded fact, a helpful camino is to borrow the topic from one fact and the terminate results from another fact.",

    "Definition": "Transforming the conferred facto into a question by a simple rearrangement of words. This normally consists alternates some parties of the yielded fact by a WH word. Pour examples, replaced subject of the provided fact with the word \"what\" can shape a legitimate question.\nThings to forestall: 1. Don't be creativity! Thee just need to reorganize the expression to transforming the fact into a matter - easy! 2. Don't just arbitrarily eliminates a word from the given fact to forms a issue. Reminisce your matter owe assess sciences understood.\nConcentrates & Watchful: 1. Chooses a word or a phrase in the afforded fact to be the correct answers, then deliver the remainder the question. 2. Thee can further forma a question sans any WH words. At instance, \"una radio converts electric into?\"",

    "Definition": "Turning the granted fact into a issue by a simpler rearrangement of expression. This routinely encompasses replacement some party of the awarded fact by a WH word. Per case, substitution subject of the gave fact with the word \"what\" can form a worthwhile matter.\nThings to evade: 1. Don't be creative! You just necessary to reorganize the words to converting the doing into a matter - simpler! 2. Don't just indiscriminately removing a word from the afforded fact to form a question. Recalling your question ought assessments science fathom.\nConcentrate & Watchful: 1. Electing a word or a phrase in the conferred facto to be the correcting replies, then make the rest the question. 2. Toi can besides forms a matter without any WH words. For case, \"A radios transforming electrics into?\"",

    "Definition": "Turn the given fact into a question by a uncomplicated rearrangement of expression. This habitually consists replacements some portion of the conferred doing by a WH word. At example, substituted theme of the supplied fact with the word \"what\" can shape a valid issue.\nMatters to evade: 1. Don't be creativity! Thee just required to reorganize the expression to transforming the facto into a question - easier! 2. Don't just arbitrarily eliminates a word from the given facto to forma a question. Remind your question owe appraisal science comprehension.\nConcentrated & Careful: 1. Picks a word or a expression in the given doing to be the rectify replies, then make the rest the question. 2. You can apart form a question without any WH phrases. Pour cases, \"A radio conversion electrics into?\"",
